        "B0CH2R3XNH <b>Copper Clad * ALUMINUM * for maybe 10 amps</b> This product sort of tricked me. I saw 12/2 wire and I’m just so used to everything being copper that I didn’t notice this listing is for CCA (Copper Clad Aluminum). That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but if - like me - you see 12 AWG and have a knee jerk expectation this can carry twenty amps then you’re going to be disappointed. That said, you don’t normally need that kind of amperage in a low voltage system anyway. What tipped me off was measuring the resistance. When I join the two ends of this roll to get a 240-ft loop, I measure 1.0 ohms (after subtracting out 0.1 for my test leads). That’s about double what I’d expect from 12 AWG copper, and puts it more in the neighborhood of 16 AWG copper. So we’re looking at wire here that can carry something in the neighborhood of ten amps — assuming you have enough voltage to even make that happen. This is a consideration that I don’t see mentioned in the product listing at the time of this writing. And that’s probably fine for most garden lighting projects (up to maybe 100W, hopefully not all going down one wire). LED lights these days really don’t use a whole lot of power. So if this product meets your needs then by all means go for it. I see nothing to complain about in terms of build quality and fully expect it to survive direct burial operation. I just want to make sure you’re not under-sizing your wire. And, just to be clear, this wire is for low voltage applications. If you’re looking to carry line voltage without running conduit then you probably want UF-B wire instead and there are rules about how deep you have to bury it (usually one foot at the very least — and that’s assuming you have ground fault protection)."

When I first stripped this wire it appeared that the insulation was unusually thick in relation to the stranded wire within, so I got out a micrometer and measured the strands. The conductors in the roll I received are .022\" to .023\" in diameter. That is roughly equivalent to 23AWG and would not carry the current in my application."

The 4 conductors are not very thick but will be sufficient for powering LED strips over a moderate distance. I would not use the wire in a location where it is exposed to the elements but for use inside a PVC conduit or indoors, it works perfectly and should last forever. Its easy to work with (cut, strip, solder). I liked that the pure copper strands wick solder immediately without having to apply excess heat which can damage the soft insulation. Overall this is a great value wire for any low voltage application requiring 4 conductors."

The use of tinned copper wire is a significant advantage of this silicone wire. The tin layer serves as a protective barrier for the inner oxygen-free copper, preventing it from being oxidized. This feature enhances the wire's longevity and ensures consistent performance over time, even in demanding conditions. The soft silicone insulator on this wire makes it highly flexible, making it easy to handle and maneuver during installations. This flexibility is a real benefit when working in tight spaces or intricate electrical setups, as it allows for smooth routing and minimizes the risk of wire kinking or damage. The availability of six different colors in the spools is a practical and thoughtful feature.

This color-coding system has been invaluable in my projects, enabling me to work more efficiently and avoid any potential wiring errors. With its rating for all under 600V devices and a rated current of 12A, this silicone wire is suitable for a wide range of applications.

        "B0BYNNJS8B <b>Good Quality, High Temp Wire</b> I work on a lot of electronics requiring 12-gauge wire and recently procured this wire for a couple of my projects. I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful."

        "B0CMTTT3PR <b>There are no ratings, UL or otherwise, on this cable</b> Ok, so I guess it really depends on what you are doing as to how happy you are going to be with this cable. If you are doing nothing more than running speaker wire, then good for you. You should be happy with the cable. If you are running power wire for an appliance, a solar system, or for any standard project other than low voltage battery, you will have to pause and wonder. What is the voltage rating? What is the current rating? Is this really OFC or something else? You can think it is something, but you will NOT know for sure. If you have an inspector ask for the ratings, you are out of luck and will have to rewire your project. The company says that it is 10 GA Oxygen free copper and they say the rating on the insulation is 200V. So, the problems start when you look at Silicon insulation and find that the normal low voltage rating is 600V up to 35,000V. 200V does not appear in any standard. Most oxygen free tinned copper still looks like copper when you cut it. This cable does not do that, even with a magnifying glass. So, how do you know? Nothing on the cable indicates that it is OFC or anything other than 10GA. Ok, once you get that resolved in your mind, this cable is designed like lamp zip cord except it splits way too easily. Great concept, but you will need to secure the cable ends somehow if you do not want it pulling apart. You can use electrical tape, shrink tubing, or even a tie wrap not pulled too tight. The cable itself is very flexible, like you would expect from a silicon wire. For use in a solar system where there is NO ground and you are required to install a breaker on both the negative and the positive side of the supply, this type of cable works very well. In fact, it is the project I started using it on until the Building inspector asked to see the data sheet on the wire or at least the UL number. Since I could not produce it, I had to remove what I had done and switch to a UL rated cable. Does that make this a bad product? No, it only makes it a quesitonable product since you do not know exactly what you have. I have not been able to find a way to directly contact the company to ask for a spec sheet. I just hope they watch the reviews and can provide the requested item, then this would be a product I would recommend. Until then, I cannot recommend it.",

Wire for rear tractor lighting needs to be run along the underside where brush, sticks, briars claw away at it constantly. More than once, I have had wiring damaged or destroyed. I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications. I really like this wire, and I look forward to using it to upgrade my tractor warning lights in preparation for spring. It would be equally suitable for use on a mowers or trailers as well. I think this product will provide adequate protection for wiring in a tough environment for a long time. In fact, with good end connections, I am hopeful that it will last as long as the equipment.",

Typically, with previous 2-wires I have used, you can split the wires apart by pulling them apart, but if you do that with this one, the jacket tears. You'll need to use a very sharp knife and very CAREFULLY cut down the middle. I added a piece of heat shrink tube to also stop it from further splitting. Recommendations: When it comes to cables, here are some considerations: 1) the thicker the wire (lower AWG number), the lower resistance, and more efficient; 2) the downside to thicker cables, is it's heavier, and sometimes less flexible; 3) higher voltage will lead to insulation breakdown (these are rated for 600 VDC). Pros: Decent fit & finish. Cons: Cost; odd 20+20 foot description; silicone jacket rips rather easily.

        "B0BYNNJS8B <b>Good Quality, High Temp Wire</b> I work on a lot of electronics requiring 12-gauge wire and recently procured this wire for a couple of my projects. I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful.",

        "B0BWGXD6BW <b>Nice design</b> This product has proven to be an excellent choice for my electrical projects, offering several key features that make it stand out from other wires on the market. The use of tinned copper wire is a significant advantage of this silicone wire. The tin layer serves as a protective barrier for the inner oxygen-free copper, preventing it from being oxidized. This feature enhances the wire's longevity and ensures consistent performance over time, even in demanding conditions. The soft silicone insulator on this wire makes it highly flexible, making it easy to handle and maneuver during installations. This flexibility is a real benefit when working in tight spaces or intricate electrical setups, as it allows for smooth routing and minimizes the risk of wire kinking or damage. The availability of six different colors in the spools is a practical and thoughtful feature. It makes it easy to distinguish between wires and simplifies identification in complex wiring configurations. This color-coding system has been invaluable in my projects, enabling me to work more efficiently and avoid any potential wiring errors. With its rating for all under 600V devices and a rated current of 12A, this silicone wire is suitable for a wide range of applications. Whether it's low-voltage electronic projects, DIY circuits, or even some home appliances, this wire can handle the task with ease and reliability.",

        "B0CL75YXB3 <b>Quality wire in a durable jacket</b> I acquired this cable to wire some repair some existing lights and add supplemental warning lights on my tractor. Wire for rear tractor lighting needs to be run along the underside where brush, sticks, briars claw away at it constantly. More than once, I have had wiring damaged or destroyed. I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications. I really like this wire, and I look forward to using it to upgrade my tractor warning lights in preparation for spring. It would be equally suitable for use on a mowers or trailers as well. I think this product will provide adequate protection for wiring in a tough environment for a long time. In fact, with good end connections, I am hopeful that it will last as long as the equipment.",

        "B0CLBHT8YX <b>Good for small projects</b> It seems I'm always scrounging for sections of wire on different RV projects and usually find something leftover from an older finished project that works but maybe is not the best (such as by adding pigtails). This has 5 fifty foot rolls of 5 colors that should end the scrounging. This is a copper clad aluminum core (CCA) wire. The copper reduces corrosion caused by moisture and oxidation and adds surface conductivity. I got it to use for some small 12V wiring projects in the RV (additional 12 volt computer fan for gas refrigerator cooling) and to have on hand when I just need some short lengths of wire. For reference, Cu Clad Al (CCA) wire can be used for main wire projects but at a much larger gauge as aluminum has a higher resistance than copper. 12 AWG is recommended for a 15 Amp 110V circuit and 10 AWG for a 20 Amp. This is a 36 strand 16 AWG braided wire so it's not made for heavy loads or 110 volt wiring. Specs are for up to 80 volts. The wire is flexible and there's enough copper coating for it to solder easily to itself. If there's trouble having the wire stick, a copper infused solder works. I used some lead free Rosin Core 2.0 Sn99 Ag0.3 Cu0.7 electronics solder and everything was sucked into the wire and stuck together. I couldn't find the percent by weight of copper anywhere on the rolls, package, or website. The range for CCA is anywhere from 10% to 24% by weight, with the more the better (but also more expensive). 15 small zip ties and 10 heat shrink tubes are included in the box. I'm never going to use this on a main AC wiring project but for small electrical projects, it's a good economical choice and should last a long time. If you don't want 5 colors and a dispenser box, 4-color roll packages of 100'/roll 16AWG of this brand are the same price if you shop around. 4 stars - copper specs not given.",

        "B0CSD35PQT <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone."

This wire looks like your typical lamp cord/zip wire, but at 12 gauge, this is pretty stout wire. Like zip wire, the two conductors are insulated in black flexible rubber insulation and joined by a thin section of rubber in the middle, so you can easily split the two conductors apart for making any necessary connections. And like typical zip wire, one of the conductors is identified by ribbing on the exterior of the insulation; this conductor is used, by convention, as the neutral wire. I've learned the hard way that before you put any wire into service, check it for breaks. Both conductors in this 100 foot spool passed the continuity test. What else is there to like? They include a chart (see photo) that shows the maximum wattage for any given length and gauge of wire, so it's nice to have that as a handy reference. It's also ETL listed (sort of like UL listed). For low voltage applications like landscape lighting, you could argue that being ETL listed is overkill, but it's a nice thing to have regardless since it is rated for up to 300 volts. One minor nit--I wish that they had length markings on the wire like some wires do--once you start using this, it's nice to be able to know how much length is remaining without having to unspool it and find it's not enough. Again, maybe overkill for a 100' spool but that would have been a really nice touch."

Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone.",
        "B092JB7VD2 <b>Well made</b> So I used this for multiple lighting runs. It's 14 gauge so that's more than enough. If you look at the wire gauge chart you can use 100 watts of lights if it's 40 feet or less. Shorter than 40 feet the carrying capacity goes up more, so this is perfect for me. I ran 12v LED Headlights and tail lights on my golf cart. I ran a 12v actuated valve on this wire. I have plans for landscape lighting but am playing with solar lights at the moment so I may never get there. Funny that the one thing it is really intended for I may never use it for! I'm sure I'll have a stereo install in the future for my son and this can work for speaker wire too. Lots of low voltage uses. The longest run I've done so far was for the 12v actuated valve, about 20', and I used maybe 10' on the golf cart. So I have plenty left over for whatever the next project is."

No fault to the seller or product, Amazon had the “order this + this + this” option for the end connectors and clamps, which you’ll also need, but it gives you a wrong size for the end clamps. The 3/4” mounting straps are the right size, but 3/4” ends to secure this 6/3 MC cable to your metal boxes is way to big. I ended up having to make a trip to the hardware store to buy smaller 1/2” end clamps instead of the 3/4” ones Amazon was recommending. I love working with MC cable, but its always a pain trying to determine the correct size anti short bushings, end caps, mounting straps etc to go with it. The sizes are all over the place depending on the gauge and number of wires and none of the sellers actually specify what size additional parts are needed to match up with it. As a side note, its also always confusing how sometimes it’ll state (for example) “6/3 wire” where you’d expect it to be three #6 wires total but in reality there are 4 wires, black, red, white and green. There isn’t always consistency in this, sure would be a lot easier if the standard was to count the actual number of wires, including the ground. This 6/3 MC cable in particular is actually four total 6 AWG wires, black, red, white, green for those that aren’t sure. It’s also rated for up to 55 Amps, which is perfect for wiring in a 50 amp RV, Dryer, or Oven outlet. Even if say your dryer outlet only requires 2 hots and a ground (6/2) with no neutral (old style), go ahead and run this (6/3) wire anyhow and just don’t use the extra wire, you’ll be doing yourself a future proof favor for the day when you replace that old appliance and discover the new one requires all 4 wires.

Even running low voltage wire is just ridiculously expensive especially if you run to one of the home stores. Ad frankly , if you're ordering wire without knowing what it is or seeing/feeling it, it can be a little scary as the quality varies so much. This wire arrives on a wooden core. Okay - that makes 500ft of heavy a little heavier, but you know they care about their product. It's also probably the only way to ship it so it doesn't end up as a bundle of knotted wire when it arrives in your standard Amazon box which in my case was shipped through UPS and clearly had a tough ride. But 500 feet of wire is pretty heavy at about 22 lbs on a 10x10-ish core. And the wire made it fine with a nice sheet of cardboard wrapped around the wire in between the core ends. The box clearly won over whichever UPS employee was fighting with it. The wire just feels like quality. It''s a firm, yet flexible outer sheath holding the two separate strands of 16 gauge wire. The sheath is UV resistant and rated for direct burial. It's UL listed and RoHS rated. It seems like a quality product and for purposes it's great. My use case is extending an existing low voltage run along the side of the property of the house to the back and introducing low voltage lights to the back yard. In southern Florida, the groundwater is high, the weather humid, and the sun hot. What better test ground for this? Anyhow it's ultimately gonna be buried under landscape rocks yet above landscape fabric in most places. Others will be direct burial In certain spots known for puddling. I expect no issues given the quality of this wire. And at 16Awg I expect it to be able to carry the 12 volts I need without concern. Highly recommend."

The PVC sheathing on this wire is smooth and I was able to easily pull it through a conduit to replace an old wire with just some electrical tape joining the ends. Tested with a light drawing 2 amps, and only detected a .3V voltage drop across the entire 50 foot coil. Sold as 12V low voltage wire, but rated for 300V. I like that this wire is rated for direct burial and waterproof, so long as it remains undamaged. It's easy enough to slide this through some conduit or at least sections of old garden hose or something to make it more durable and resist chafing. The PVC sleeve is somewhat loose and the individual wires can be removed from short sections fairly easily. Not very flexible, but easy enough to bend. The price point is typical for similar products, but I see a 20% discount is currently offered, making it a good bargain for a good product.",

I needed 12 gauge wire for a project, and thought I would give this a try. A 20 ft run of this wire supplying 14.3 volts DC with a constant load of 25 amps showed only .15 volts of voltage drop. Comparable multi-strand copper wire in another circuit of the same wire length and specifications was showing a .21 voltage drop. Yes, there could be other items in play that I am not accounting for, but this is just merely indicating that this wire type is not any WORSE of a conductor than what you would normally purchase at the parts store to repair wiring on your vehicle. The added flexibility of the wire seems to be a plus, especially since I was wiring in some off-road lights when it was 15 deg F outside.

I joined two of the conductors together to form a 200-ft loop for a resistance test and it measured 0.9 ohms (after subtracting 0.1 for my test leads). That’s about right for 16 AWG wire. And I love how they included heat shrink to protect your crimp points. This is for low voltage applications, as indicated in the product title. I realize that (at least at the time of this writing) the product description claims it can handle up to 600V, but I’m fairly certain it’s not UL listed for that to comply with electrical code. If you want to run full line voltage outdoors without conduit then you should be looking for UF-B wire and there are rules about how deep you have to bury it (usually one foot at the very least — and that’s assuming you have ground fault protection). This product is either for low voltage landscape lighting (12-24V) or telecommunications. You don’t normally need four conductors for lighting, but I’ll leave that to you to figure out.

        "B07GH7JHG9 <b>Beware of Copper Clad Aluminum Wire!</b> When shopping for Cat5e or Cat6 network cables, make sure you are comparing apples to apples. One of the most common tactics of the “low cost leaders” is to use aluminum instead of copper wire. This can lead to network issues from using inferior materials to transmit the signal. Looking to cut costs, manufacturers started using aluminum wire dipped in a thin coating of copper. This technique created an aluminum core cable surrounded by a thin layer of copper. The performance and safety of CCA cables are radically different. In fact, aluminum network cables violate TIA and IEC standards for Cat5e and Cat6 cables. CCA cable has higher attenuation than pure copper cables. This results in a greater loss of data, as packets have to be re-transmitted. The more data that is re-transmitted, the slower your network performs. Plus, these problems are compounded by every foot of cable you use; the longer the cable, the worse the performance. CCA cables also have a 55% higher DC resistance. This increases the amount of energy that is transferred into heat and reduces the amount of power that can be transferred. This issue makes them unusable for power over Ethernet (PoE) devices like IP cameras and phones. These cut corners also affect installers because aluminum wire creates installation issues. Due to the lower tensile strength, aluminum cables can be damaged when being pulled. Single conductors can break, making the cable useless, or the whole cable can snap. Aluminum also has a lower bend radius than pure copper cables. This means you can’t bend it as much before it fails. In short, spend the extra money on solid core copper cable."

If your cable runs are all short and you have a modest number of LED fixtures then 14/2 may be good enough for the entire system. Note that 14/2 cable has a lower current rating than 12/2 cable, which is counterintuitive given the numbers are getting smaller as ampacity increases.

It is very flexible which was great because I had to pull it under the floor and through obstacles including through 3 walls to install it. I had changed my RV refrigerator over to a 12 volt compressor and due to a 30 foot run the wire I had with so few strands and smaller gauge had too much voltage loss to run the fridge well. This wire made an immediate difference and does not lose the voltage and carry amps load far greater than what I will ever need but it is nice to have more than less capability.

If your cable runs are all short and you have a modest number of LED fixtures then 14/2 may be good enough for the entire system.

Since some of those may involve something on my boat, having tinned conductors is a real plus -- it does help prevent corrosion of the copper, and you can see the tinned strands in one of my included photos. My one issue with this product is the claim that the conductors are 18 gauge. Granted, I don't plan to use this anywhere that I'll be pushing the limits of an 18ga wire, but I did want at least to test the claims. I don't have a great way of measuring the diameter of the wire, especially with twisted strands. This is technically what the wire gauge means. However, a wire's resistance is a function of its cross-sectional area, and there are numerous free online calculators to let you determine what the resistance of a certain gauge of wire should be for a given length of wire. Here's what you do: Search for wire resistance calculator Enter 18 gauge and 50 ft You get 0.319 ohms Measure the resistance of one conductor for the entire 50' spool Compare your resistance reading to what it should be As shown, I used the red conductor (they should all be the same) and I got between 0.38 and 0.40 ohms. Since the resistance is higher than it should be for 18 gauge, I can know with reasonable certainty that the wire is smaller than 18 gauge. In fact, a 19 gauge wire (uncommon in the US) should be right at 0.403 ohms for 50' of wire. This all may not sound like much, but the resistance is over 22% higher than it should be for 18ga, which means that you're getting 22% less copper than you're expecting. All that's to say that this product seems fine, and as long as you're not depending on the full conductivity of a true 18 gauge wire, you'll be good. However, I tend to score products pretty harshly when they make claims that they can't hold up to, and sadly that's the case with this cable. Buy it and use it, eyes wide open, or buy something else if you need a true 18 gauge wire."

Say if 10AWG pure copper holds 30 amps between 12-80V DC, then CCA wire of the same cross directional size would probably safely hold ~24 amps or less (<21 amps) if you hold CCA wire as the same conductance as pure aluminum and believe the copper layer is just for show.

I usually buy my lugs directly from sky high car audio, but I was in a bit of a money pinch so $10 for a pack of 10 didn’t seem that worth it at the time. I ended up coming across these bad boys, which happened to be the best deal around. 50 lugs for less than $40. Honestly I was pretty hyped. I ended up remember that car audio 1/0 is not standard 1/0 welding wire. It’s actually oversized 1/0…so right in between 1/0-2/0. I decided to go for the 2/0 lugs and purchased 50 of them. I tested it out on 1/0 sky high wire and it fit like a GLOVE. The 2/0 lug itself is smaller than sky high 1/0 lug, which was kinda nice because I am working on tight space. I did try the 2/0 lug on some sky high 2/0 and there’s no chance it would go in. Maybe if you force a ton, but even then it won’t work. I couldn’t even get the head of the wire in and these lugs are flared outwards too. I haven’t crimped them yet but I will soon, I’ll update the review when I get to crimping stage. But as of now, they get a 5/5 for fitting oversized 1/0 car audio wire. Update 3/6/22: crimping is absolutely awesome. I have two types of crimpers, hydraulics and handheld $30 crimpers from amazon. I decided to use the handheld crimper, even though it doesn't go up to 2/0 size. Stuck it on the 1/0 setting and did 2 crimps at the bottom and top of the lug.

        "B0CV7XP7JN <b>True Marine Grade Tinned Copper Wire</b> So I really wanted to find out what makes good wire. Turns out there’s a few factors when determining a quality wire. 1. Copper is better than aluminum, as (semi) precious metals such as silver, gold , platinum etc. are superior, however, cost prohibitive. 2.copper should be bright and 3. The wire jacket should not show any wear or distinguishable defect with the heat of a cigarette applied to it. Makes sense for scenarios when a fire may be present especially on motor vehicles. 3. Must exhibit moderate to good flexibility. 4.the shielding must be smooth throughout. If not, that means the wire has not been produced be acceptable standards. Unevenness of the wire core may create sliding within the shielding due to looseness created. In my testing this wire meets all these requirements with only a slight mark off for slight mark left after the cigarette test. I think that this is adequate wire for anyone’s build requiring 18 gauge marine grade wire. The tin coated copper is even and well applied. The copper is on the rigid side, however, acceptable for good quality in terms of flexibility.

And in our recent endeavor, the direct burial landscape light wire we procured became a star player. Boasting robust construction, it met our criteria both in terms of price and performance. The industrial-grade PVC insulation is a testament to its durability, ensuring longevity even in demanding outdoor conditions. As a 2-wire product, it further simplifies installations. A thoughtful touch is the distinctive design of each wire: one side is smoothly finished, while the other bears grooves, making identification a breeze during setup. However, there's one aspect where the product could be enhanced — its packaging. The wire is sheathed entirely in plastic, and accessing it requires completely removing this protective cover. This might sound like a minor quibble, but when you're deep into the intricacies of landscaping, unwrapping the wire can become a tangled chore, leading to unintended project delays. In conclusion, the landscape light wire has much going for it, and I'd consider repurchasing it for future projects. But a packaging redesign is to facilitate easier unspooling and more convenient storage."

        "B0BWGXD6BW <b>Nice design</b> This product has proven to be an excellent choice for my electrical projects, offering several key features that make it stand out from other wires on the market. The use of tinned copper wire is a significant advantage of this silicone wire. The tin layer serves as a protective barrier for the inner oxygen-free copper, preventing it from being oxidized. This feature enhances the wire's longevity and ensures consistent performance over time, even in demanding conditions. The soft silicone insulator on this wire makes it highly flexible, making it easy to handle and maneuver during installations. This flexibility is a real benefit when working in tight spaces or intricate electrical setups, as it allows for smooth routing and minimizes the risk of wire kinking or damage. The availability of six different colors in the spools is a practical and thoughtful feature. It makes it easy to distinguish between wires and simplifies identification in complex wiring configurations. This color-coding system has been invaluable in my projects, enabling me to work more efficiently and avoid any potential wiring errors. With its rating for all under 600V devices and a rated current of 12A, this silicone wire is suitable for a wide range of applications. Whether it's low-voltage electronic projects, DIY circuits, or even some home appliances, this wire can handle the task with ease and reliability."

If you have any less in the wall, it's probably just not worth it for a standard HVAC system. Even with 4 wires and two of these kits, you can only get to 6 wire equivalent, which doesn't run quite everything you would find in a typical house (pick only one of 2 stage heat, 2 stage cooling, and humidifier). If it's even moderately accessible, just buy yourself a nice flex drill and pull in a new 7/8 wire thermostat bundle. Installation was a hassle on my furnace, though. First, the included wires are really short, to the point that I had to extend them just to reach a surface for mounting. Secondly, the extra wires would not fit on the terminal screws along with with the original wires, so I had to crimp spade connectors to each pair. Third, the expectation is to use a wire nut to connect the diode to the blue wire. A bunch of thermostats, mine included, use solid/stiff wire and small holes in the wall. The wire nut did not hold well under that stress, so you may need to either make a larger hole in the wall, or replace the joint with something more sturdy, like a tight mechanical twist and solder.

I am using this 18-2 wire as speaker cable in a jeep where the wire travels outside the car. Because it is water and oil resistant, the jacket should last a very long time against whatever gets flung onto it. Because it essentially has two jackets, it is more resistant to abuse, the extra padding slightly helps prevent radio interference in and out as well. What I like ~ • Feels like quality wire ~ the jacket feels like higher end microphone cabling. It's also fairly flexible and easy to shape. • Looks like quality wire ~ as advertised, UL is clearly marked and the jacketing appears to be uniform in thickness around the inner insulators. Copper is tinned and spun neatly. What I do not like ~ nothing to note here."

I needed 12 gauge wire for a project, and thought I would give this a try. A 20 ft run of this wire supplying 14.3 volts DC with a constant load of 25 amps showed only .15 volts of voltage drop. Comparable multi-strand copper wire in another circuit of the same wire length and specifications was showing a .21 voltage drop. Yes, there could be other items in play that I am not accounting for, but this is just merely indicating that this wire type is not any WORSE of a conductor than what you would normally purchase at the parts store to repair wiring on your vehicle. The added flexibility of the wire seems to be a plus, especially since I was wiring in some off-road lights when it was 15 deg F outside.

I wiped the wall with a damp microfiber to remove any dust and let it dry. I then applied the Ghost Wire starting at one end, peeling about a foot of the backing off at a time, smoothing it and rubbing it to the wall. Working the wrinkles out as I went along. Within one day, both ends of the run had about 6 inches peeling off the wall. Three days later, and both ends are now peeled off about 2 feet. Every morning I've tried to rub it back to the wall. My walls do have a very slight orange peel texture. Perhaps on a smooth finish the Ghost Wire would adhere better. I have not attempted to paint over it yet (and likely won't since it doesn't stay on). The total length of my application was 11.5 feet. Beyond the issue of it not remaining adhered, there were a couple other issues as well. First, there's about 1/8 of clear adhesive which is not covered by the white surface material running down the entire length of the roll. This is very visible (and sticky feeling). I was hoping that I could spray some wall texture over it since paint will likely not cover it correctly. I also snapped off my exposed ends when attaching the end connectors. Since the copper is very thin, any etching done with a razor blade to cleanly expose the copper strips weakens it to the point that any flex will shear it off. I had to peel back and use scissors, leaving a small flap rather than a nice clean transition. My Ghost Wire also was quite wrinkled from being rolled up. The manufacturer states that it's a known issue and recommends a heatgun/hairdryer to remedy so I expected that going in I liked the idea of this product. If it would have stayed on the wall, it would have been great. Even with the problems I had, I could see this working well if run under a carpet. I'm contemplating using a router to notch a shallow channel in the drywall and then just mud over the inserted wire. [update] A week later, and it's completely peeled off. Not an inch is left stuck to the wall. It's just hanging between the two connector blocks that are screwed in."

        "B01K4RPB3O <b>Good quality, high strand-count high flexibility tinned wire with silicone rubber insulation</b> This 22 AWG (gauge) silicone insulated wire is excellent for indoor or protected environments where high flexibility/lack of stiffness, and non-melting (or at least melt resistant) insulation is required. The conductors are a 'high strand count\" type, meaning that instead of being comprised of just a few larger/thicker strands, it is instead comprised of a much greater number of smaller/thinner strands; and this contributes to its lack of stiffness/great flexibility. The other contributing factor to the high flexibility is that the insulation is silicone rubber, rather than the more common PVC (which is rather stiff). This kind of high strand count, silicone rubber insulated wire is exactly what high quality test equipment 'test leads' have been made of for decades. The silicone rubber is also much less heat sensitive than more common insulations such as PVC or \"machine tool wire\". It won't melt off as readily as PVC insulation does if your soldering iron needs to be held onto a joint or terminal for an extended period of time. The fine wire strands are also nicely tinned, and the insulation strips off easily and cleanly, and the stranded wire solders easily. It is a good quality product at an affordable price. HOWEVER, it is not the best choice for many common \"hook up wire\" applications, since its lack of stiffness can be an issue; the strands definitely need to be twisted and soldered in order to keep their shape enough to be formed into a hook before soldering around a terminal for example. This wire also does not want to cooperate if you want to twist a few of them together, because their limpness makes them uncooperative in that regard. And if you use this wire in \"hook up wire\" applications, it wants to just flop into some odd position rather than 'staying put' where you want it to be. Silicone rubber insulation is also not that great when it comes to abrasion resistance, and resistance to some kinds of oils and such where other insulations may be preferable.",

        "B096JZCT1B <b>Fits the bill for the job</b> I’m a DIYer who recently ran a new five-conductor thermostat wire in preparation for adding a smart thermostat at an existing forced hot air furnace installation. I bought the 50 foot spool of thermostat wire for that project from a big box store. This item’s packaging, in contrast, comes in a cardboard box of significantly smaller dimension than the big box store’s spool of wire, which was in a clear plastic bag. As seen in the photo, the box is maybe 5 inches square and about a couple inches tall. I gave some thought to this. If I were an HVAC contractor, I think the smaller footprint of this item’s design would be a better approach for easy storage when in the field. But the downside to this is the wire’s coiled memory may make fishing the wire a bit more challenging than the wider diameter of the big box version. Aside from this interesting but probably trivial difference, this item seems perfect for its intended purpose. It strips well with the usual wire stripper tools. Continuity was verified with all five conductors. The conductors’ colors match industry standard. Coming from the aforesaid DIYer here, I guess you can take that with a healthy grain of salt :) but I think we’re on page that this the right design for thermostats needing five conductors. I intend to use this item to re-wire an existing smart thermostat installation at a different property, where the existing wiring is rather amusing but functional. I think this item is up to the task and look forward to using it. I think it will also serve me well when I take on some nifty Arduino project with external sensors that need to be wired up. All kinds of cool possibilities here. Glad I picked this item."

        "B0C5FC1KJZ <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again)."

        "B07111R7N8 <b>FOR CAR AUDIO PEOPLE…</b> I was looking for copper tinned lugs for my car audio build. I usually buy my lugs directly from sky high car audio, but I was in a bit of a money pinch so $10 for a pack of 10 didn’t seem that worth it at the time. I ended up coming across these bad boys, which happened to be the best deal around. 50 lugs for less than $40. Honestly I was pretty hyped. I ended up remember that car audio 1/0 is not standard 1/0 welding wire. It’s actually oversized 1/0…so right in between 1/0-2/0. I decided to go for the 2/0 lugs and purchased 50 of them. I tested it out on 1/0 sky high wire and it fit like a GLOVE. The 2/0 lug itself is smaller than sky high 1/0 lug, which was kinda nice because I am working on tight space. I did try the 2/0 lug on some sky high 2/0 and there’s no chance it would go in. Maybe if you force a ton, but even then it won’t work. I couldn’t even get the head of the wire in and these lugs are flared outwards too. I haven’t crimped them yet but I will soon, I’ll update the review when I get to crimping stage. But as of now, they get a 5/5 for fitting oversized 1/0 car audio wire. Update 3/6/22: crimping is absolutely awesome. I have two types of crimpers, hydraulics and handheld $30 crimpers from amazon. I decided to use the handheld crimper, even though it doesn't go up to 2/0 size. Stuck it on the 1/0 setting and did 2 crimps at the bottom and top of the lug. Had my dad pull one end of the wire while I held the lug end of the wire. We both pulled as hard as we could and it didn't even move. I'd say they work as intended."

My previous counterpoise was regular insulated copper wire and it became a pain keeping it straight, as to store the 19.5\" wire when not in use you wrap it around the HT. When unwrapping it the wire would retain the bends and would not hang straight down as you want. Trying to smooth it out and remove the bends was pretty much pointless, and it would want to keep curling back. Then when you stowed your HT, it would happen again when you pulled it out again and unwound it. I saw a recommendation to use silicone-insulated wire as it was much more flexible. I gave it a shot, and it is indeed much better for this purpose. The wire retains a little bit of memory when you unwind it, but a few smoothing passes of your hand down it gets it pretty straight, and it will \"loosen up\" even more over time. I get better performance out of this compared to my prior counterpoise, but that could be the result of intentionally going down a wire gauge to a thicker wire, the line staying straighter, the increased number of strands inside compared to the previous wire, the difference in connecting (soldering a wire loop versus using a terminal ring) or a combination of all four."

        "B085SV67Y2 <b>Really great but I goofed...</b> This review serves 2 purposes... 1) to help anyone who's inexperienced at working with copper wire so the won't make my same mistake and... 2) to recommend Copper Wire USA for jewelry wire needs. I've ordered directly from Copper Wire USA's website before and prefer to purchase from them (either at their Amazon store or from their website) for all my bare copper wire needs and would highly recommend them to others who need bare copper wire. The 14 gauge dead soft copper round wire on a spool is good (very good quality, packaged well, speedy delivery, etc,) but due to a mistake on my part, I should've taken into consideration that even with dead soft wire, any copper wire larger than 18 gauge should be coiled. It's just so much easier to straighten. I could anneal it but that's extra work and cleaning I don't want to deal with so I should've spent the extra 3 bucks on their website for a coil with 10 extra feet of wire. Again, this was MY FAULT because I didn't want to spend $3 extra because I thought it would potentially be ok on a spool but it's much harder to straighten the kinks out. I knew better and ordered it anyway; therefore, I will keep it and use it for texturing."

Insulation on this wire is a lot more heat resistant and the heat can be cranked up to solder guitar pots faster. The insulation also low(ish) friction, so if you zip-tie a couple together, they stay put. The cable is very soft and flexible which is great in things that are regularly moved around. This is also a negative as these wires have no memory and can not retain certain shape, kind of hard to tuck them somewhere or push out of the way as they are like rubber bands."

        "B0BYNNJS8B <b>Good Quality, High Temp Wire</b> I work on a lot of electronics requiring 12-gauge wire and recently procured this wire for a couple of my projects. I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful."

It will hold my excessive unhealthy weight. I can shove spare extra lumber on top of this wire after stringing it across the bottom edges of open rafters in the garage. Has never broken nor stretched over the 24 inch spaces it spans. ALL steel wire will stretch, depending on how you work it, over longer distances. However, I haven't re-tensioned the first roll at all since stringing a bunch of lights three years ago. One run is 53 feet with 50 lights on it. I needed something like this because it's ruinous to the light string to put any meaningful tension directly to a string and so you have to support the string on something like this. Don't bother with cables as that's huge and expensive overkill and they're hard to terminate. Don't use poly or fabric line; they WILL sag. If you have problems with the wire keeping some of its curl, that's absolutely normal. It's coiled steel! Add much tension and then back off a bit. Remember that light strings have a significant straightening effect. If it's snarling when you try to unwind it, most likely you're uncoiling from the outside, not the inside end. Been that way since they invented the stuff a few centuries ago. OR you can unroll it from the outside end after mounting it like a wheel to a horizontal bar (F-clamp, broom handle or pipe propped in a step ladder, and such).",

        "B07GH7JHG9 <b>Beware of Copper Clad Aluminum Wire!</b> When shopping for Cat5e or Cat6 network cables, make sure you are comparing apples to apples. One of the most common tactics of the “low cost leaders” is to use aluminum instead of copper wire. This can lead to network issues from using inferior materials to transmit the signal. Looking to cut costs, manufacturers started using aluminum wire dipped in a thin coating of copper. This technique created an aluminum core cable surrounded by a thin layer of copper. The performance and safety of CCA cables are radically different. In fact, aluminum network cables violate TIA and IEC standards for Cat5e and Cat6 cables. CCA cable has higher attenuation than pure copper cables. This results in a greater loss of data, as packets have to be re-transmitted. The more data that is re-transmitted, the slower your network performs. Plus, these problems are compounded by every foot of cable you use; the longer the cable, the worse the performance. CCA cables also have a 55% higher DC resistance. This increases the amount of energy that is transferred into heat and reduces the amount of power that can be transferred. This issue makes them unusable for power over Ethernet (PoE) devices like IP cameras and phones. These cut corners also affect installers because aluminum wire creates installation issues. Due to the lower tensile strength, aluminum cables can be damaged when being pulled. Single conductors can break, making the cable useless, or the whole cable can snap. Aluminum also has a lower bend radius than pure copper cables. This means you can’t bend it as much before it fails. In short, spend the extra money on solid core copper cable."

It pulled about 900ma which means for that length of wire (eye-balled not measured) resistance is about 13 ohms. It glowed bright red. Note that wire increases in resistance as it is heated so this measurement will be higher than with an ohmmeter. I wrapped it around a pair of needle-nose pliers and pulled until it gave way. It required a few pounds of tension. Easily strong enough to use to cut Styrofoam, my opinion. I don't think copper will like the heat of a direct connection.

The 14 gauge dead soft copper round wire on a spool is good (very good quality, packaged well, speedy delivery, etc,) but due to a mistake on my part, I should've taken into consideration that even with dead soft wire, any copper wire larger than 18 gauge should be coiled. It's just so much easier to straighten. I could anneal it but that's extra work and cleaning I don't want to deal with so I should've spent the extra 3 bucks on their website for a coil with 10 extra feet of wire. Again, this was MY FAULT because I didn't want to spend $3 extra because I thought it would potentially be ok on a spool but it's much harder to straighten the kinks out.

I have bought this twice because it's strong, predictable, flexible enough to wrap around itself by hand on a screw eye, absolutely rust free, and forgiving of my putting a ridiculous amount of tension on it. It will hold my excessive unhealthy weight. I can shove spare extra lumber on top of this wire after stringing it across the bottom edges of open rafters in the garage. Has never broken nor stretched over the 24 inch spaces it spans. ALL steel wire will stretch, depending on how you work it, over longer distances. However, I haven't re-tensioned the first roll at all since stringing a bunch of lights three years ago. One run is 53 feet with 50 lights on it. I needed something like this because it's ruinous to the light string to put any meaningful tension directly to a string and so you have to support the string on something like this. Don't bother with cables as that's huge and expensive overkill and they're hard to terminate. Don't use poly or fabric line; they WILL sag. If you have problems with the wire keeping some of its curl, that's absolutely normal. It's coiled steel! Add much tension and then back off a bit. Remember that light strings have a significant straightening effect. If it's snarling when you try to unwind it, most likely you're uncoiling from the outside, not the inside end. Been that way since they invented the stuff a few centuries ago. OR you can unroll it from the outside end after mounting it like a wheel to a horizontal bar (F-clamp, broom handle or pipe propped in a step ladder, and such)."

        "B0CGQ29J9Q <b>Perfect for outdoor speaker wire.</b> I like listening to music when I’m outside working in the yard. I move a column speaker outside and connect it to a small PA amp. The flexible KWANGIL 16 AWG wire makes this process much easier than the stiffer 18 AWG speaker wire that I had previously been using. As an added bonus, this wire is UV stable and also tinned to protect it from corrosion. And the tinned wire is super easy to solder. KWANGIL even supplies the coil with an end cap on each wire end to keep the wire in perfect condition until it’s ready to be used. The 20 feet of wire is supplied wound in a ~7 ½ inch coil and packaged in a sealed plastic bag. Thanks to the large size of the coil, when the wire is unwrapped it lays fairly flat unlike wire that has been tightly coiled. Stripping the outer jacket was just as easy as the listing said it would be. I stripped 4 inches from one end with no problem. Stripping the individual wires on the other hand isn’t as easy. The insulation on each wire is tight but that also keeps moisture away. Stripping ½ inch took a bit of work, stripping 1 inch I found easiest to do in two ½ inch pieces. The wire works great with the speaker and is easy to coil when I’m ready to put the speaker away."

One of the most common tactics of the “low cost leaders” is to use aluminum instead of copper wire. This can lead to network issues from using inferior materials to transmit the signal. Looking to cut costs, manufacturers started using aluminum wire dipped in a thin coating of copper. This technique created an aluminum core cable surrounded by a thin layer of copper. The performance and safety of CCA cables are radically different. In fact, aluminum network cables violate TIA and IEC standards for Cat5e and Cat6 cables. CCA cable has higher attenuation than pure copper cables. This results in a greater loss of data, as packets have to be re-transmitted. The more data that is re-transmitted, the slower your network performs. Plus, these problems are compounded by every foot of cable you use; the longer the cable, the worse the performance. CCA cables also have a 55% higher DC resistance. This increases the amount of energy that is transferred into heat and reduces the amount of power that can be transferred. This issue makes them unusable for power over Ethernet (PoE) devices like IP cameras and phones. These cut corners also affect installers because aluminum wire creates installation issues. Due to the lower tensile strength, aluminum cables can be damaged when being pulled. Single conductors can break, making the cable useless, or the whole cable can snap. Aluminum also has a lower bend radius than pure copper cables. This means you can’t bend it as much before it fails. In short, spend the extra money on solid core copper cable."

I did a small meter test to make sure there was no break any where in the middle of what I needed and got it installed worked like a charm. The wire is insulated with an out PVC layer I wouldn't recommend leaving it out into the elements for extended periods of time as you know what sun and heat can do to anything electric. I would use this cable for in wall projects and maybe to bury in the dirt to hide away but I'm also a fan of use a conduit whether it's PVC piping or the flexible plastic tubing with a split in it to stick cables in easily. Overall the cable is tough and didn't lose signal in any of my projects by far and for the sake of it I used it on speakers and they worked with now sound quality loss.

This 16 gauge, 100 feet long, 2 conductor speaker wire with a CL2 rating was perfect for my outdoor setup. The white jacket gives it a clean look, and the fact that it's designed for direct burial in the ground made it easy for me to run the wire without having to worry about any additional protection.

        "B08FMGHSMY <b>PROS: FLEXIBLE, RELIABLE, GREAT PRICE-- CONS: NONE I'VE FOUND.</b> This is the best wire I've ever used, hands down. To put this in perspective, I go through probably 100 ft. of automotive primary wire in any given week. I do a LOT of small electrical jobs for friends and family, everything from fixing headlights and wiring harnesses, to adding completely new circuits like heated seats or sound systems. I have 0 sound degradation when I use them for speaker wire. If you use it for that, something I've learned by a lot of real world trial and error, that may help someone else out there, is to run the speaker wires down the opposite side of the car you run the power wires; I don't know why it helps, someone who's smarter than I could tell you..maybe it helps cut out interference or something, but tbh I have no idea at all and am not educated enough on that to tell you the why, I just know that it really works. It's almost like some kind of weird, ancient, wiring feng-shui that yields better performance based on geographical location. Supernatural, ancient, far-east, geo-kinestethic techniques and practices aside, it really just helps get the desired result of clear, non-fuzzy sound... ...Ok! anyways, the crazy flexibility and high-strand count of the conductor inside the insulation makes it stupid dumb easy to push em through tight fitting holes without the need to alter the existing structure of something. They're surprisingly elastic, as well, which helps not tear off end bits of wire if you're like me and use an automatic wire stripper... and insist on having the tension permanently set to \"kill\" 😃. The elasticity of the insulation, which is made of/made with with silicone, also means if it gets caught while you run it, you step on it or slam it in something while pulling the wire, that won't (in my experience) compromise the conductor inside. I know that I SHOULD just replace that section of wire, even if it doesn't appear to be damaged, which I do when time and materials allow... and I know I SHOULD stop eating so much red meat, I know I SHOULD stop smoking, I know I SHOULD finally fix that back door screen that bangs every time the wind blows any faster than is required to move a stupid American Beauty grocery bag... my point is that I SHOULD do a lot of things, but don't always get to. in the real world sometimes you just aren't able to do things by the book, for whatever reason, and this wire hasn't let me down when those situations arise. I'll leave you with my answer to the question \"is this **** good enough to be the only wire ill use for automotive and small electronic applications moving forward?\"... ...\"bet\".

        "B079NXCN6B <b>Choose Your Location Well</b> Choosing a strategic location for the Ghost Wire can affect its visibility. I tried to butt it against corners, door frames, and base board to minimize its visibility. Likes: It gets the job done without needing to drill through walls, floors, or ceilings and then \"fish\" for speaker wire behind the wall or between joists; After working out the first connection to a terminal, the rest of them were easy to do; When I connected my speakers, it worked the first time and I have had no problems with the sound; Without doing any feathering or texturing, It took a coat of paint and matched the existing wall color perfectly (I have to point out the tape to people in order to get them to notice that it's there.) Dislikes: Although we had freshly painted walls (professionally done), the adhesive likes to come loose in a few places even though it was thoroughly pressed against the wall upon installation (It's not the worst thing in the world but I don't like to see any gap between the tape and the wall); I needed a little more Ghost Wire than was on the 100' reel so I ordered another 25' which is not on a reel and had a lot more bubbling (didn't easily lay flat on the wall); At over a buck per linear foot, it is a bit too pricey to use in every room; the folded corners do have a tendency to stand out, literally. NOTE: You still need speaker wire to run from the terminals to the speakers (I have wall mounted speakers and use about 1 foot of regular wire per speaker) and from the terminals on the other end to the amplifier or other source. If you order banana plugs (either solid or braided wire) with the terminals, the plugs do not fit into the holes in the terminals and you have to use bare wire.

Even veteran contractors often do not know this product exists and it is a lifesaver. Due to the increase in use of Wi-Fi thermostats, which require a common, more people are using similar products. This is because Wi-Fi thermostats require a common . If a common ids required, you must have a minimum of five wires and many homes were wired with four wires if they had single stage heat abd mercury thermostats. This is a common issue with older hones. Another issue is that Low-voltage wiring is very fine and it is hard copper, not stranded. So, age can allow for deterioration and breakage causing problems. Since thermostat wires can be very difficult to pull, depending on if the wire is nailed inside the trusses, inside the walls, in a multi level home or condo, this product can also provide a replacement for a broken wire for a standard stat. This inexpensive product allows us to forgo running a new thermostat wire, at several hundred dollars expense to the customer. We can provide a replacement wire for a daily wine when pulling a new wire is difficult or cost prohibitive, or provide the common needed when needed for a wifi stat when only 4 wires exist.

I have found that this flexibility makes it easy to route the wire in tight spaces and around corners without any issues. Additionally, the stranded construction ensures that the wire is resistant to breakage and can withstand the rigors of demanding applications. The tinned copper conductors are another great feature of this wire. The tinning process adds a layer of protection to the copper, making it more resistant to corrosion and extending the lifespan of the wire. This is particularly important for marine applications, where exposure to moisture and saltwater can be a concern. The 18/2 wire configuration, with two conductors, is suitable for a wide range of electrical projects. It allows for easy connection of various components, such as LED strips, lamps, switches, and more.

        "B01JM8J4TI <b>What is AWG.</b> AWG for Solid wire is a specific diameter and has certain resistance per foot for copper wire. You can not compare stranded wire by diameter. Copper is expensive, and so many wires are produced with a mix of copper and other materials to lower cost. When wire is tested, the AWG (gage) of the wire needs to correspond to rated current flow and not exceed the casing temperature to protect against fire and shock. The casing(usually PVC or better material) material and thickness is usually controlled to protect against abrasion as well of surrounding temperature for degradation. Seller obviously doesnt know it.....and so buyer beware. If the wire has a UR or UL mark on it......and it not fake, then it meets a AWG standard and should have be tested. Just because it says AWG on it doesnt mean its has been tested either....",

Needed wire to run through the attic from the LED strips to a controller about 22 feet away. Wanted something heavier than the 22 gauge wire you find everywhere, and I wanted 100 foot spool Those two combinations limited what was out there. Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white). Even with my current strips, would have been nice to be able to upgrade without having to re-run wire. Oh well, happy anyway!"

The 20 feet of wire is supplied wound in a ~7 ½ inch coil and packaged in a sealed plastic bag. Thanks to the large size of the coil, when the wire is unwrapped it lays fairly flat unlike wire that has been tightly coiled. Stripping the outer jacket was just as easy as the listing said it would be. I stripped 4 inches from one end with no problem. Stripping the individual wires on the other hand isn’t as easy. The insulation on each wire is tight but that also keeps moisture away. Stripping ½ inch took a bit of work, stripping 1 inch I found easiest to do in two ½ inch pieces. The wire works great with the speaker and is easy to coil when I’m ready to put the speaker away."

The lights are powered by a low voltage cable under the walkways. Last Winter a mother fox made a temporary den for her cubs under one of the boardwalks. In the Spring we discovered that several of the marker lights wouldn't light up due to power cables that were chewed through by sharp little teeth. The foxes have moved on but we were faced with repairing the broken cable. That's why I got this cable. It's perfect for low voltage outdoor use. The outside jacket is thick and robust. It took a bit of careful cutting to strip it off without damaging the inside conductor wires. Once off, I noticed this isn't just a standard single channel insulator jacket. It actually has two channels -- one for each of the conductors. (See photo.) That's makes for very tightly insulated conductors that should provide enhanced protection in underground or very wet environments. When I stripped the two conductors, I noticed they are not tinned as stated in the product description. This may or may not be an issue for you. Tinned copper cable is easier to solder and also minimizes corrosion for non-soldered joints. I removed a star from an otherwise five star review due to this. Summary Comments If you don't need tinned copper cable for low voltage outdoor applications, this is a good choice.

Each wire comes on it's own individual plastic reel, but they are not labeled. The actual wire sheathing IS labeled with the wires size and capacity. Speaking of the wire sheathing, it is very SOFT, leading to a wire that's very flexible but at the cost of abrasion resistance. You can easily strip the sheathing from the wire with your finger nails. The box of 6 colors I ordered came with a small number of small colored zip ties that correspond to each color of wire in the box, a very nice touch.",

        "B01KWBPC7M <b>Very decent wire. In depth review & Pics</b> Running some permanent LED strips in the living room vaulted ceiling. Needed wire to run through the attic from the LED strips to a controller about 22 feet away. Wanted something heavier than the 22 gauge wire you find everywhere, and I wanted 100 foot spool Those two combinations limited what was out there. Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white). Even with my current strips, would have been nice to be able to upgrade without having to re-run wire. Oh well, happy anyway!"

The 30ft length wasn't long enough for my application so I had to buy another roll locally, which was 16/2 and had the 2 wires stuck together like speaker wires would be. I found this wire much easier to work with. 18g is plenty big enough for a string of LED lights, so the 16 was unnecessary. The outer jacket was plenty easy to strip off the wires, and the insulation on the wires themselves was easy to strip. as for soldering all the wires together, I found this wire much easier to work with than the 16g, and the insulation was small enough that the shrink tubing would also shrink over the small gauge wire that was attached to the lights themselves. The wire is also nice and flexible, which made it easy to bury. I only had a standard shovel for the trench, so it had to follow a path that looked kind of like this ~~~~.

Conductor appears to be pure copper strands, which is as claimed, not copper coated aluminum. The individual strands are quite fine. I counted 64 strands after stripping. Makes it very flexible and not likely to break after many and extreme bends.

But you weren't expecting a mainstream brand anyhow, and it's just outdoor low voltage wire. It's fine. Looks like it will hold up in the garden. - One thing to keep in mind is that because it's bare copper wire (not tined, like marine wire) the connections are subject to corrosion from moisture and humidity. Make sure to use a connector method that either bonds the ends (solder) or creates a waterproof barrier to prevent this. - At the time I ordered the 16/2 165ft roll was $41, making it an okay deal, considering it's generic wire. - Hope this helps",

        "B0C63QKZ55 <b>Good quality wire</b> If you have an old house like I do, you are constantly repairing and replacing things that have just ran their lifespan, and outlets are one of those. The people who built my house put GFICI outlets on the back of the house around the pool area and time, and the second owners, have taken their toll on them. For whatever reason, so were taken out by ripping the plastic conduit off the boxes and the wires just cut off. How it ever passed home inspection is beyond me, but being the electrician that I am, I have been working on replacing them. Since I was already in the process, I decided to use this wire since it should cover the code requirements for the outlets. I pulled out the old wire from the subpanel (with the power off, off course). Being in Florida, the old wire was about 50 years old and crusty with the humidity and having had various creatures in there over the years. This wire was fully pliable at 14 gauge, and I had no issues pulling in through the bungs and watertight fittings I had added. I'm a fan of flexible conduit and 14 gauge is much easier to pull through it than 12, but make sure you know your local code requirements (or have a licensed electrician do the work) if you are doing this. I have wired three outlets with this wire and haven't found any issues with it. I found it to be easily workable, strips like I would expect it to, and didn't find any flaws in it. I can't see any fault with recommending this wire for your 14/2 wiring jobs.",

It also took solder without any issue which is great as I have gotten wire on amazon that did not. A few things to note around the product listing, it says it's rated for 19 amps, this is really pushing things, 16AWG is light duty size. Most of your cheap extension cords use 16AWG so you really shouldn't be pushing more than 13 amps through this wire. It says it complies with North American Safety Standards but nothing on the box or wire had the normal stamps and marks that you find on wire you buy at the big box stores so I don't trust that claim.

        "B0CSD35PQT <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone.",

        "B0CGQ29J9Q <b>Perfect for outdoor speaker wire.</b> I like listening to music when I’m outside working in the yard. I move a column speaker outside and connect it to a small PA amp. The flexible KWANGIL 16 AWG wire makes this process much easier than the stiffer 18 AWG speaker wire that I had previously been using. As an added bonus, this wire is UV stable and also tinned to protect it from corrosion. And the tinned wire is super easy to solder. KWANGIL even supplies the coil with an end cap on each wire end to keep the wire in perfect condition until it’s ready to be used. The 20 feet of wire is supplied wound in a ~7 ½ inch coil and packaged in a sealed plastic bag. Thanks to the large size of the coil, when the wire is unwrapped it lays fairly flat unlike wire that has been tightly coiled. Stripping the outer jacket was just as easy as the listing said it would be. I stripped 4 inches from one end with no problem. Stripping the individual wires on the other hand isn’t as easy. The insulation on each wire is tight but that also keeps moisture away. Stripping ½ inch took a bit of work, stripping 1 inch I found easiest to do in two ½ inch pieces. The wire works great with the speaker and is easy to coil when I’m ready to put the speaker away.",

This wire is made from oxygen-free copper with a little silver and tin to protect it, which is especially important when the wire is carrying high current. It is easy to strip, readily accepts solder, crimp, compression, or butt connectors so you can make reliable connections and splices. The manufacturer also includes some heat-shrink tubing with this product but its small diameter (only a little larger than each insulated conductor itself) didn’t make it particularly useful. I did a high current test to measure the wire's resistance and found it to be 0.0025 ohms/ft., just what it should be for AWG 14 copper, so, this is definitely a high quality product.",

        "B0C5MGQNKS <b>Used as Speaker wire</b> I am using this as speaker wire for my \"Presence\" speakers in my 7.1 surround sound system. It was easy to open the outer jacket and separate the individual wires. I just used a utility knife. I did not have to apply much pressure, therefore making it easier to avoid cutting the insulation on the individual cables. I have an old wire stripper from the early seventies that came from Radio Shack. I just put the cables in and squeeze and get perfectly stripped ends. I have used these strippers on some cables that this is not so easily done. Attached are pictures of the strippers and pictures of the wire at various stages. In one of them you can see where I stripped the middle of the cable insulation. I kept all 4 wires, 2 for each channel in the main jacket until I got to the top of my cabinet where I mounted the speakers. Then I pulled out two wires for one channel. From there I continued to pull the complete jacket with the other two wire to the other speaker. I connected banana plugs to the ends that go into my receiver. Basically, just strip, push the cable through and then screw the tips on. These are Amazon Basics Speaker Connector Banana Plugs,12 Count (1 Pack of 6 Pairs), 0.54 x 0.54 x 1.62 inches. I have used these many times on installations. This wire was easy to use with these plugs. The wire work fine. Sound is great. Installation was easy. What can I say? It is wire; the way it should be.

        "B0C5BLQ327 <b>Very thick yellow jacket, high quality</b> If you've worked with typical romex before, you know how thin the jacket is. It can snag and tear pretty easily. That is sometimes a curse and a blessing. The blessing is when stripping the wires at the termination. Easier to cut and strip back the jacket. The jacket on this wire is at least 3x the thickness. I should have taken a picture to prove my point, but I am not exaggerating. 12awg solid core wire is pretty stiff anyways, but the added thickness of the jacket makes it even stiffer. Once again, a blessing and a curse. Thicker jacket, more protection, but it takes a bit more work to trim the jacket back. I suppose in bulk, the additional jacket thickness would contribute to the weight of the product as well, but it wasn't noticeable in the 25ft length I ordered. The 12awg wires stripped perfectly with my wire strippers without gauging the conductors.",
        "B07TFF9FTM <b>Surprisingly great</b> I am astounded at the high quality of the wire that I have in my hand given the low price that I paid for it. The gauge appears accurate; the insulation seems to be high quality and is not overly stiff; the wire is easy to strip. Other little things I like: The wire spools have holes on the sides, rather than through the spindle, making it much easier to use them to prevent a full-ish spool from unraveling. The spools arrived wrapped in reusable hook-and-loop cable ties rather than the more typical, annoying to open plastic shrink wrap. The cardboard dispenser box is actually sturdy, and the holes are well-placed and the right size for the wire. It will absolutely be a good long-term storage solution for the wire. It would be hard to be less than impressed with this product. When it comes to basic breadboard-compatible hookup wire, this one appears to be the one to buy.",

        "B0CN316VHN <b>Clean copper wire, verifies as true 16-gauge copper</b> I got this YOTIGER 16-gauge low-voltage copper pair wire to use for 12V lights in the house and car. It's pretty beefy and at 1A has less than 1V drop over the entire 100 feet. I had no problem stripping the wire and the copper is clean underneath. The roll didn't come with the inner end sticking out so I unrolled it all, drilled a larger hole so it would fit, then re-wrappped (poorly). The inner end could be connected to a power source to allow re-using the roll for temporary tasks needing power at a distance. I measured 3.4mm dia. insulation, 1.4mm dia. wire. Resistance over the whole roll (100 ft. x both directions) was 0.864 ohms, which works out to 4.32 ohms per 1000 ft (verified with LCR meter and running 2A current through it). Matches expected for 16-gauge copper stranded wire. I had to unroll all the wire to get at the other end as they don't poke it through the hole on the side of the spool.",

Sheathing encasing all 20 wires is easy to cut, with a white wrapping that helps protect against cutting the inner wires. The stranded wires are indeed tinned, take solder well, and stiff enough but not too stiff which helps in the soldering and assembly of a wire harness. Only issue I initially had was that when I used 10ft of it to carry signals for 16 WS2812B strips and 2 pairs to send power back to the controller, I was getting glitches on some of the strips, 4 in particular, and there was crosstalk across channels if any were not connected to the signal driver that I was going to abandon using the cable and use CAT5 instead. But then this cable wasn't designed for handling signals with effective bandwidth of 2.5Mhz so I can't penalize the product. After all, it is advertised for uses like alarm connections and the like.

Some of the wire I was using previously was just too large to fit in the post holes of my audio equipment. The 14 gauge of this wire is hefty enough that I'm sure it's carrying a decent signal, and yet thin enough that it doesn't fray when attaching to my equipment. The outer sleeve is the perfect consistency as well, and the inner wire is \"loose\" enough inside that when cutting the outer sleeve there's little danger of also cutting the wire. It also cuts extremely easily, meaning no scoring multiple times trying to get to the wire inside. The insulation on the wires seems like standard insulation, not the gel-type thick insulation found on other brands of speaker wire. If you do a lot of wiring, this is key as a standard wire stripper works great with it - a real time saver. The clear red and black insulation is handy as well - no looking for symbols on the wire insulation, you can just tell at a glance and from a distance which is positive and which is negative, so there is much less chance of any mixup."

So, I wanted to have a bit of wire on hand for that. I found this multi-color bundle of stranded 22 gauge wires from QSJXZGH. There are 5 rolls, each with 26.2 feet of wire. There is a roll of red, black, yellow, blue, and green. The insulation is rubbery and stripped off easily for me. This set comes with a nice little cardboard box. There are small holes on both sides where you can feed the wires through to act as dispensers. One side is under the lid, so the wire ends are held under the lid when not in use. The other side is opposite so you can keep the lid closed and be able to pull wire out. It also comes with a small pack of heat shrink tubing in the same colors as the wires. I'm pleased with this set. It's not a massive amount of wire, but gives me some options for wire colors to help me keep my circuits straight."

        "B0BYNNJS8B <b>Good Quality, High Temp Wire</b> I work on a lot of electronics requiring 12-gauge wire and recently procured this wire for a couple of my projects. I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful."

I bought the 50 foot spool of thermostat wire for that project from a big box store. This item’s packaging, in contrast, comes in a cardboard box of significantly smaller dimension than the big box store’s spool of wire, which was in a clear plastic bag. As seen in the photo, the box is maybe 5 inches square and about a couple inches tall. I gave some thought to this. If I were an HVAC contractor, I think the smaller footprint of this item’s design would be a better approach for easy storage when in the field. But the downside to this is the wire’s coiled memory may make fishing the wire a bit more challenging than the wider diameter of the big box version. Aside from this interesting but probably trivial difference, this item seems perfect for its intended purpose. It strips well with the usual wire stripper tools. Continuity was verified with all five conductors. The conductors’ colors match industry standard.

Thankfully the conductors themselves are solid copper wire and not copper clad aluminum otherwise known as CCA. And for a bit more icing on the cake, this coil of Arizona Electrical Solutions wire costs less than half of what the same length coil of wire in the big box stores near me costs. And in case 25 feet of 14 gauge wire is not what you need for your next project, this company also sells other gauges and lengths here on Amazon. And again, it's made in America. This is truly a winner."

Nice! - Sheath material easy to work with and strip, as are the wires themselves. Bad: - The listing shows \"CL2/CL3 rated\". Well which is it?

It has no filling in the sheath, and looks like no direct bury wire I have ever used.

I started to make a cable with it and noticed the two wires split very easily, too easily. With only moderate use this wire will keep separating. The ends should always have a piece of heat shrink tubing at the ends to prevent it from becoming two wires, even when storing. That is partially an effect of the insulation being so flexible. From the picture you can see how many small flexible strands there are. I measured one with my caliper and the reading was 0.002 inches. This is really nice wire to work with because of the extreme flexibility. I took a piece of insulation and hit it with my soldering iron set to 593F. The insulation didn't burn, smoke or even make a dent. This is just super wire to use for higher current applications."

This wire looks like your typical lamp cord/zip wire, but at 12 gauge, this is pretty stout wire. Like zip wire, the two conductors are insulated in black flexible rubber insulation and joined by a thin section of rubber in the middle, so you can easily split the two conductors apart for making any necessary connections. And like typical zip wire, one of the conductors is identified by ribbing on the exterior of the insulation; this conductor is used, by convention, as the neutral wire. I've learned the hard way that before you put any wire into service, check it for breaks. Both conductors in this 100 foot spool passed the continuity test. What else is there to like? They include a chart (see photo) that shows the maximum wattage for any given length and gauge of wire, so it's nice to have that as a handy reference. It's also ETL listed (sort of like UL listed). For low voltage applications like landscape lighting, you could argue that being ETL listed is overkill, but it's a nice thing to have regardless since it is rated for up to 300 volts. One minor nit--I wish that they had length markings on the wire like some wires do--once you start using this, it's nice to be able to know how much length is remaining without having to unspool it and find it's not enough. Again, maybe overkill for a 100' spool but that would have been a really nice touch."

The home inspector we used seemed new to the business, at least that is what I'm chalking his performance up to. I am an electrician, so I know when electrical wiring is up to code and when it isn't. Unfortunately, my house is full of poor wiring, so I have been working on getting everything up to par before I need to use my generator for an emergency. The wire comes in a plastic-wrapped roll with a couple bands around it. I'm used to Romex coming in the plastic roll that you can pull out of the middle, but this wasn't as easy as that. The wire is pliable, as I would expect 14 gauge wire to be, and it stripped well. I had to pull a number of lengths through flexible conduit and it was just stiff enough to push through without a fish tape if the conduit was straight. Overall, I give this wire high marks. I did not encounter any of it that had poor craftmanship, it works great for 15A circuits, and I haven't had an issue after using about 150 feet of it. I will order more and keep it on hand."

The outer black sheath is smooth and feeds well through conduit without lubrication. The product is priced very well if you think you are buying top quality copper conductor cable. The cons: This is really lousy cable. The conductors are supposed to be 23 AWG but the box I received measured below 24 AWG. The individual wires are brittle and break easily. So easily in fact that it was almost impossible to terminate in an RJ-45 plug. After spending hours placing this cable through walls and attic space, testing revealed there was a break somewhere along the cable. Makes perfect sense. Just manipulating the twisted pair to straighten for termination would cause at least one of the eight conductors to snap off. I have terminated lots of twisted pair cable and this was by far the most difficult to work with. Also, the product title does not indicate this is copper coated aluminum (CCA) cable wire."

        "B0BRS56YR9 <b>Works great for farm use</b> The RiteFENCE Electric Fence Double Insulated Underground Hard Cable is working perfectly for use 'underneath' my 12' and 16' foot double gates that lead to my pasture. For years I have used a system where I disconnect my electric fence by hand to open my gates without getting shocked. I dug a small trench about 6\" deep under a couple of my gates and buried the RiteFENCE, and left each end protrude out of the ground about two feet to connect to one of the lower existing fence wires so as not to disconnect the continuous circuit at any time when opening gates now. I chose the 6\" depth to bury the heavily insulated RiteFENCE since in addition to moving livestock through the gates, I also drive vehicles and farm implements through the gates as well. The RiteFENCE is very sturdy and rigid, and the 12-½ gauge took some time to straighten out to fit flat and neatly into the trenches I dug and placed the wire into, but this is a definite plus for electric fence wire to be used on a farm or ranch. The RiteFENCE doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and has a thick outer coating with the inner wire apparently coated as well for the 'double insulation' aspect. When installing, I also cut back a couple of inches of the RiteFENCE on each end and used a heavy duty crimp connection to the barb wire fencing I use. Once crimped, I neatly wrapped the connections with quality electrical tape to seal from the elements. The RiteFENCE is going to be ideal for many other underground connection needs I have around the farm. I would highly recommend any farmers and ranchers who run electric fence to give the RiteFENCE a try if you want to eliminate the risk of a nasty shock, especially with the higher powered fence chargers. The price point seems very fair and in fact is actually a little cheaper than what I saw at my local farm supply store. Highly recommend!"

        "B07GH7JHG9 <b>Beware of Copper Clad Aluminum Wire!</b> When shopping for Cat5e or Cat6 network cables, make sure you are comparing apples to apples. One of the most common tactics of the “low cost leaders” is to use aluminum instead of copper wire. This can lead to network issues from using inferior materials to transmit the signal. Looking to cut costs, manufacturers started using aluminum wire dipped in a thin coating of copper. This technique created an aluminum core cable surrounded by a thin layer of copper. The performance and safety of CCA cables are radically different. In fact, aluminum network cables violate TIA and IEC standards for Cat5e and Cat6 cables. CCA cable has higher attenuation than pure copper cables. This results in a greater loss of data, as packets have to be re-transmitted. The more data that is re-transmitted, the slower your network performs. Plus, these problems are compounded by every foot of cable you use; the longer the cable, the worse the performance. CCA cables also have a 55% higher DC resistance. This increases the amount of energy that is transferred into heat and reduces the amount of power that can be transferred. This issue makes them unusable for power over Ethernet (PoE) devices like IP cameras and phones. These cut corners also affect installers because aluminum wire creates installation issues. Due to the lower tensile strength, aluminum cables can be damaged when being pulled. Single conductors can break, making the cable useless, or the whole cable can snap. Aluminum also has a lower bend radius than pure copper cables. This means you can’t bend it as much before it fails. In short, spend the extra money on solid core copper cable."

I usually buy my lugs directly from sky high car audio, but I was in a bit of a money pinch so $10 for a pack of 10 didn’t seem that worth it at the time. I ended up coming across these bad boys, which happened to be the best deal around. 50 lugs for less than $40. Honestly I was pretty hyped. I ended up remember that car audio 1/0 is not standard 1/0 welding wire. It’s actually oversized 1/0…so right in between 1/0-2/0. I decided to go for the 2/0 lugs and purchased 50 of them. I tested it out on 1/0 sky high wire and it fit like a GLOVE. The 2/0 lug itself is smaller than sky high 1/0 lug, which was kinda nice because I am working on tight space. I did try the 2/0 lug on some sky high 2/0 and there’s no chance it would go in. Maybe if you force a ton, but even then it won’t work. I couldn’t even get the head of the wire in and these lugs are flared outwards too. I haven’t crimped them yet but I will soon, I’ll update the review when I get to crimping stage. But as of now, they get a 5/5 for fitting oversized 1/0 car audio wire. Update 3/6/22: crimping is absolutely awesome. I have two types of crimpers, hydraulics and handheld $30 crimpers from amazon. I decided to use the handheld crimper, even though it doesn't go up to 2/0 size. Stuck it on the 1/0 setting and did 2 crimps at the bottom and top of the lug. Had my dad pull one end of the wire while I held the lug end of the wire. We both pulled as hard as we could and it didn't even move. I'd say they work as intended.",

I wiped the wall with a damp microfiber to remove any dust and let it dry. I then applied the Ghost Wire starting at one end, peeling about a foot of the backing off at a time, smoothing it and rubbing it to the wall. Working the wrinkles out as I went along. Within one day, both ends of the run had about 6 inches peeling off the wall. Three days later, and both ends are now peeled off about 2 feet. Every morning I've tried to rub it back to the wall. My walls do have a very slight orange peel texture. Perhaps on a smooth finish the Ghost Wire would adhere better. I have not attempted to paint over it yet (and likely won't since it doesn't stay on). The total length of my application was 11.5 feet. Beyond the issue of it not remaining adhered, there were a couple other issues as well. First, there's about 1/8 of clear adhesive which is not covered by the white surface material running down the entire length of the roll. This is very visible (and sticky feeling). I was hoping that I could spray some wall texture over it since paint will likely not cover it correctly. I also snapped off my exposed ends when attaching the end connectors. Since the copper is very thin, any etching done with a razor blade to cleanly expose the copper strips weakens it to the point that any flex will shear it off. I had to peel back and use scissors, leaving a small flap rather than a nice clean transition. My Ghost Wire also was quite wrinkled from being rolled up. The manufacturer states that it's a known issue and recommends a heatgun/hairdryer to remedy so I expected that going in I liked the idea of this product. If it would have stayed on the wall, it would have been great. Even with the problems I had, I could see this working well if run under a carpet. I'm contemplating using a router to notch a shallow channel in the drywall and then just mud over the inserted wire. [update] A week later, and it's completely peeled off.

The cable is starting to detach in some areas and now I'm wondering if I should add a stronger glue (very messy) or change cables (after the big investment on these ones).

        "B079NXCN6B <b>imperfect solution</b> Seemed like a good fit for my situation. I really didn't want to run wire through so many walls. After cleaning the walls, installing and painting it looked reasonably good. Sure there was a visible bump, but with pictures and knick-knacks breaking up the visual space it wasn't noticeable unless you were looking for it. Over time (several months to a few years), however, the wire just started peeling off. It took a lot of time to be sure, but especially on exterior walls (which get colder than the ambient temperature of the room) they came completely detached in sections. Still using them while I look for a better solution, but it looks ridiculous on the exterior wall where it's almost completely fallen off.",
        "B079NXCN6B <b>Started peeling off in less than a day</b> It doesn't stay stuck to my wall. I followed the instructions and watched the video beforehand. I wiped the wall with a damp microfiber to remove any dust and let it dry. I then applied the Ghost Wire starting at one end, peeling about a foot of the backing off at a time, smoothing it and rubbing it to the wall. Working the wrinkles out as I went along. Within one day, both ends of the run had about 6 inches peeling off the wall. Three days later, and both ends are now peeled off about 2 feet. Every morning I've tried to rub it back to the wall. My walls do have a very slight orange peel texture. Perhaps on a smooth finish the Ghost Wire would adhere better. I have not attempted to paint over it yet (and likely won't since it doesn't stay on). The total length of my application was 11.5 feet. Beyond the issue of it not remaining adhered, there were a couple other issues as well. First, there's about 1/8 of clear adhesive which is not covered by the white surface material running down the entire length of the roll. This is very visible (and sticky feeling). I was hoping that I could spray some wall texture over it since paint will likely not cover it correctly. I also snapped off my exposed ends when attaching the end connectors. Since the copper is very thin, any etching done with a razor blade to cleanly expose the copper strips weakens it to the point that any flex will shear it off. I had to peel back and use scissors, leaving a small flap rather than a nice clean transition. My Ghost Wire also was quite wrinkled from being rolled up. The manufacturer states that it's a known issue and recommends a heatgun/hairdryer to remedy so I expected that going in I liked the idea of this product. If it would have stayed on the wall, it would have been great. Even with the problems I had, I could see this working well if run under a carpet. I'm contemplating using a router to notch a shallow channel in the drywall and then just mud over the inserted wire. [update] A week later, and it's completely peeled off. Not an inch is left stuck to the wall. It's just hanging between the two connector blocks that are screwed in."

We live in Mexico and it is not against code, but if you are concerned I would check with your local code.

If I was to do it again I would sand the wall and ceiling where the wire will lay down to give a completely flat finish.

It doesn't tangle/bulge internally and it coils sensibly. My wire gauge confirms it's 22awg. I plan to use this in my hobby of LED lighting controllers where this works well to send data, ground, and +VDC (5, 12, 24) to the strands from each transformer. I was pleased at the way this is packaged. Instead of being on a spool that explodes with released tension when uncoiled, this is on a larger plastic spool that's easy to \"tie off\" for reuse and very closely matches (coincidence?) the spools that LEDs come on, allowing them to live harmoniously in a box or standing on end in a file cabinet. The sheath strips nicely. The wires tin well. The cable doesn't sproing into a garage door spring at pressure when released from the package to use. It's a good price. If you need wire at the specifications listed, it's hard to go wrong here. While there are a number of variables involved, the required math is pretty straight-forward. 22G is about 43.4 ohms per km or 0.0434 ohms.per meter. Your project may not be running all channels at max brightness on all bulbs (RGB...and sometimes W) at the same time or it may be doing so for only a fraction of a second. Doing it for hours inside a packed conduit is different than an air-gapped conduit or being in the open. Just doing some quick math, let's imagine a 241 WS2812 project (like a Hexagon or a short strip) where each bulb is pulling .60ma per bulb (full intensity, white, and eye-torching white ON) That's a 14.5 W fixture at 24V, so you can use 22 gauge wire like this to drive 283feet and still lose only 1VDC at 24V. (It's worse at low voltages - this is why you want high voltages if wire length matters. It's the reason the power company lines to you are at 10's of thousands of volts....) If you're just doing boosters into taps, I'd imagine the distance to be even longer. 22Gauge is a good tradeoff of \"easy to work with\" and \"enough copper to deliver your electrons without resistance\" (hahahhaa. Ohm's Law jokes never get old.) I also did a spot test on painting it and it seems to take paint acceptably well. Some of this spool is probably going to end up in a permanent fixture that's tucked/painted into a corner of mine. This cable seems to be everything it claims to be and a nice set of specs for consumer lighting. Not fusable strands. Not chunky/expensive solid copper. Recommended.",

I only have two issues with this and would probbaly have dinged a 1/2 star if that was an option: I measured one of the rolls to see if I was getting 20ft, and it came up about 4 inches short. This isn't too bad for 20ft, but I expect to get every inch I paid for. Now maybe some of the other rolls were longer, but I didn't verify. If that is the case then they need to be more consistant. The second issue involves using the box as a \"dispenser\". THere are holes in the back of the box to feed the wire. The problem is if you put all 6 spools in side by side, then there isn't enough room to close the lid or for the spools to spin. They came packed with the spools in a 2x3 configuration instead of the 1x6 configuration you would use for dispensing. This is because they don't fit otherwise. Looks like good wire. So if you dn't mind being shorted a couple of inches, and don't need the dispenser to work well with 6 rolls of wire, and otherwise this is a good value for you, then this is your product.

It was a quick purchase, Solid Hookup Wire size 22. Well, my big mistake. This wire is insane thick. Non usable for all my applications, takes too much space. Can't use it in tight packed fixtures where size 22 was a perfect fit so far. Forget soldering it to smaller connectors with a few pins. Since I did not use it, I can't comment on other wire qualities. I assume extra thickness may be a plus where it is desired. Not for me. Also, entire wire seems very soft, almost like stranded wire. My old hookup wire was solid and much harder, stiffer. I liked it because wire stayed in exact desired position after I bent, adjusted it to space in my fixtures. 3 stars only because extra thickness is not mentioned in description, and it is still called HOOK UP WIRE which to me is not true."

        "B0CSD35PQT <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone."

        "B0CK4WHWBY <b>Reliable and Durable Outdoor Wiring Solution</b> One of the standout features is its robust construction. The wire is encased in a flexible PVC jacket that not only makes it durable but also ensures it is waterproof, oil-proof, and UV-resistant. This is a crucial aspect for outdoor installations, providing peace of mind that the wire can withstand various weather conditions without compromising its integrity. The 18-gauge thickness is perfect for low voltage applications, such as LED lighting and automotive speakers. The stranded design adds flexibility, making it easy to work with and allowing for smooth installations even in tight spaces. Additionally, the direct burial capability is a notable advantage, eliminating the need for conduit in certain situations. I found the cable easy to strip and terminate, making the installation process straightforward. The overall build quality instills confidence in its longevity, and I appreciate the attention to detail in its design. In summary, the 18 Gauge Electrical Wire has proven to be a reliable and durable solution for outdoor lighting projects. Its waterproof and UV-resistant properties, combined with the flexibility of the stranded design, make it an ideal choice for anyone seeking a high-quality cable for low voltage landscape lighting and other outdoor applications."

        "B0C5FC1KJZ <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again)."

The insulation is good quality and feels the exact same as other silicone wire I have purchased at the orange big box store. It also took solder without any issue which is great as I have gotten wire on amazon that did not. A few things to note around the product listing, it says it's rated for 19 amps, this is really pushing things, 16AWG is light duty size. Most of your cheap extension cords use 16AWG so you really shouldn't be pushing more than 13 amps through this wire. It says it complies with North American Safety Standards but nothing on the box or wire had the normal stamps and marks that you find on wire you buy at the big box stores so I don't trust that claim.

        "B0CMTTT3PR <b>There are no ratings, UL or otherwise, on this cable</b> Ok, so I guess it really depends on what you are doing as to how happy you are going to be with this cable. If you are doing nothing more than running speaker wire, then good for you. You should be happy with the cable. If you are running power wire for an appliance, a solar system, or for any standard project other than low voltage battery, you will have to pause and wonder. What is the voltage rating? What is the current rating? Is this really OFC or something else? You can think it is something, but you will NOT know for sure. If you have an inspector ask for the ratings, you are out of luck and will have to rewire your project. The company says that it is 10 GA Oxygen free copper and they say the rating on the insulation is 200V. So, the problems start when you look at Silicon insulation and find that the normal low voltage rating is 600V up to 35,000V. 200V does not appear in any standard. Most oxygen free tinned copper still looks like copper when you cut it. This cable does not do that, even with a magnifying glass. So, how do you know? Nothing on the cable indicates that it is OFC or anything other than 10GA. Ok, once you get that resolved in your mind, this cable is designed like lamp zip cord except it splits way too easily. Great concept, but you will need to secure the cable ends somehow if you do not want it pulling apart. You can use electrical tape, shrink tubing, or even a tie wrap not pulled too tight. The cable itself is very flexible, like you would expect from a silicon wire. For use in a solar system where there is NO ground and you are required to install a breaker on both the negative and the positive side of the supply, this type of cable works very well. In fact, it is the project I started using it on until the Building inspector asked to see the data sheet on the wire or at least the UL number. Since I could not produce it, I had to remove what I had done and switch to a UL rated cable. Does that make this a bad product? No, it only makes it a quesitonable product since you do not know exactly what you have. I have not been able to find a way to directly contact the company to ask for a spec sheet. I just hope they watch the reviews and can provide the requested item, then this would be a product I would recommend. Until then, I cannot recommend it.",

I'm not sure the Amazon listing made it clear that this is UL approved, but it is. I measured the outside diameter at .225\", and peeling back the Rayon cover reveals a round white PVC jacket that is .210\" diameter. The PVC makes this cord rugged but also quite stiff compared to true antique (and less safe) cloth-covered cord that was usually just one or two cloth layers wound directly over the two individually-insulated conductors, but without the extra molded PVC jacket. Vintage cord used on lamps, radios, and other electrical devices usually was a little less bulky, more flexible and sometimes had an oval cross-section rather than round. This cord is well-suited for modern retro lighting and restoration applications where extreme flexibility and the ability to hang naturally under its own weight over short lengths is not a requirement. For greater flexibility, twisted cloth-covered cord is available from other sources. This has each PVC coated conductor individually wrapped in cloth and the pair of wires twisted together, yielding greater flexibility. Several years ago I had to buy cord like this for an antique replica that I built, and I paid a lot more buying it from an antique radio part supplier. This is a high quality product with safety approvals at a very good price. Highly recommended."

It is UL2464 Complaint, which means in a nutshell: It’s certified safe as an “external interconnect cable”. AKA: You’re alright using this outside; even burying it underground. The wire jackets/sheathing itself are robust and flexible as with the primary jacket/sheath. It also has a good bit of copper (tin also) in its makeup. This on paper and upon observation this is very good wire. I wouldn’t use it to jump a car battery, or wire up a competition car audio system (been there, done that, and was a garage manager) but low power on/off applications in all weather environments, you’re going to be just fine. I only wish I could have gotten a larger roll. I’d recommend it. Seems better than the line contractors installed underground for our underground sprinkler system.",

I'm not sure the Amazon listing made it clear that this is UL approved, but it is. I measured the outside diameter at .225\", and peeling back the Rayon cover reveals a round white PVC jacket that is .210\" diameter. The PVC makes this cord rugged but also quite stiff compared to true antique (and less safe) cloth-covered cord that was usually just one or two cloth layers wound directly over the two individually-insulated conductors, but without the extra molded PVC jacket. Vintage cord used on lamps, radios, and other electrical devices usually was a little less bulky, more flexible and sometimes had an oval cross-section rather than round. This cord is well-suited for modern retro lighting and restoration applications where extreme flexibility and the ability to hang naturally under its own weight over short lengths is not a requirement. For greater flexibility, twisted cloth-covered cord is available from other sources. This has each PVC coated conductor individually wrapped in cloth and the pair of wires twisted together, yielding greater flexibility. Several years ago I had to buy cord like this for an antique replica that I built, and I paid a lot more buying it from an antique radio part supplier. This is a high quality product with safety approvals at a very good price. Highly recommended."

The conductors are a 'high strand count\" type, meaning that instead of being comprised of just a few larger/thicker strands, it is instead comprised of a much greater number of smaller/thinner strands; and this contributes to its lack of stiffness/great flexibility. The other contributing factor to the high flexibility is that the insulation is silicone rubber, rather than the more common PVC (which is rather stiff). This kind of high strand count, silicone rubber insulated wire is exactly what high quality test equipment 'test leads' have been made of for decades. The silicone rubber is also much less heat sensitive than more common insulations such as PVC or \"machine tool wire\". It won't melt off as readily as PVC insulation does if your soldering iron needs to be held onto a joint or terminal for an extended period of time. The fine wire strands are also nicely tinned, and the insulation strips off easily and cleanly, and the stranded wire solders easily. It is a good quality product at an affordable price. HOWEVER, it is not the best choice for many common \"hook up wire\" applications, since its lack of stiffness can be an issue; the strands definitely need to be twisted and soldered in order to keep their shape enough to be formed into a hook before soldering around a terminal for example. This wire also does not want to cooperate if you want to twist a few of them together, because their limpness makes them uncooperative in that regard. And if you use this wire in \"hook up wire\" applications, it wants to just flop into some odd position rather than 'staying put' where you want it to be. Silicone rubber insulation is also not that great when it comes to abrasion resistance, and resistance to some kinds of oils and such where other insulations may be preferable."

Needed wire to run through the attic from the LED strips to a controller about 22 feet away. Wanted something heavier than the 22 gauge wire you find everywhere, and I wanted 100 foot spool Those two combinations limited what was out there. Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white). Even with my current strips, would have been nice to be able to upgrade without having to re-run wire. Oh well, happy anyway!",

I was impressed by how flexible this wire is and its resistance to high temperatures. With a 200C and 600V rating, it can be used in just about any application. Unlike most stranded wire, there are way too many strands to count, which is the reason why it is so flexible.

        "B09V56LTY5 <b>Good for repairing outdoor marker light cables, robust insulation, pure copper wire - not tinned</b> We have an extensive series of outdoor stairs and boardwalks that are lighted by LED marker lights every ten feet. The lights are powered by a low voltage cable under the walkways. Last Winter a mother fox made a temporary den for her cubs under one of the boardwalks. In the Spring we discovered that several of the marker lights wouldn't light up due to power cables that were chewed through by sharp little teeth. The foxes have moved on but we were faced with repairing the broken cable. That's why I got this cable. It's perfect for low voltage outdoor use. The outside jacket is thick and robust. It took a bit of careful cutting to strip it off without damaging the inside conductor wires. Once off, I noticed this isn't just a standard single channel insulator jacket. It actually has two channels -- one for each of the conductors. (See photo.) That's makes for very tightly insulated conductors that should provide enhanced protection in underground or very wet environments. When I stripped the two conductors, I noticed they are not tinned as stated in the product description. This may or may not be an issue for you. Tinned copper cable is easier to solder and also minimizes corrosion for non-soldered joints. I removed a star from an otherwise five star review due to this. Summary Comments If you don't need tinned copper cable for low voltage outdoor applications, this is a good choice. The insulation is robust and should hold up well in underground or wet environments. You get pure copper conductors that provide efficient electrical conductivity."

Wire for rear tractor lighting needs to be run along the underside where brush, sticks, briars claw away at it constantly. More than once, I have had wiring damaged or destroyed. I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications. I really like this wire, and I look forward to using it to upgrade my tractor warning lights in preparation for spring. It would be equally suitable for use on a mowers or trailers as well. I think this product will provide adequate protection for wiring in a tough environment for a long time. In fact, with good end connections, I am hopeful that it will last as long as the equipment."

This has 5 fifty foot rolls of 5 colors that should end the scrounging. This is a copper clad aluminum core (CCA) wire. The copper reduces corrosion caused by moisture and oxidation and adds surface conductivity. I got it to use for some small 12V wiring projects in the RV (additional 12 volt computer fan for gas refrigerator cooling) and to have on hand when I just need some short lengths of wire. For reference, Cu Clad Al (CCA) wire can be used for main wire projects but at a much larger gauge as aluminum has a higher resistance than copper. 12 AWG is recommended for a 15 Amp 110V circuit and 10 AWG for a 20 Amp. This is a 36 strand 16 AWG braided wire so it's not made for heavy loads or 110 volt wiring. Specs are for up to 80 volts. The wire is flexible and there's enough copper coating for it to solder easily to itself. If there's trouble having the wire stick, a copper infused solder works. I used some lead free Rosin Core 2.0 Sn99 Ag0.3 Cu0.7 electronics solder and everything was sucked into the wire and stuck together. I couldn't find the percent by weight of copper anywhere on the rolls, package, or website.

In the attached photo you can see the 18 gauge cable on the left and the 16 gauge wire on the right. I am disappointed with how thin this cable is and am concerned with it's durability. Also it was more expensive."

Most of your cheap extension cords use 16AWG so you really shouldn't be pushing more than 13 amps through this wire.

        "B0CSD35PQT <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone.",

For whatever reason, so were taken out by ripping the plastic conduit off the boxes and the wires just cut off. How it ever passed home inspection is beyond me, but being the electrician that I am, I have been working on replacing them. Since I was already in the process, I decided to use this wire since it should cover the code requirements for the outlets. I pulled out the old wire from the subpanel (with the power off, off course). Being in Florida, the old wire was about 50 years old and crusty with the humidity and having had various creatures in there over the years. This wire was fully pliable at 14 gauge, and I had no issues pulling in through the bungs and watertight fittings I had added. I'm a fan of flexible conduit and 14 gauge is much easier to pull through it than 12, but make sure you know your local code requirements (or have a licensed electrician do the work) if you are doing this.

The wire is of good quality and it has met my expectations. One of the main reasons I purchased this wire was for its length. The 40FT wire is long enough to cover the entire length of my LED strip lighting project and it provides enough slack to make the installation process much easier. The 2pin 2 color red black cable also makes it easy to identify the positive and negative wires, which is very helpful during the installation process. The red and black color coding also helps me to keep track of the connections and ensure that everything is connected properly. The 18-gauge wire is also thick enough to handle the current of my LED strip lights, which I found to be a big plus. It ensures that the wire can handle the power and prevents any potential overheating or damage to the wire. The only downside to this product is that the wire is a bit stiff, it's not very flexible which can make it a bit difficult to bend and shape to the desired position. But it's a small price to pay for the quality and durability of the wire. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the TYUMEN 40FT 18 Gauge 2pin 2 Color Red Black Cable Hookup Electrical Wire for LED Strips.

        "B0CQV2VQSZ <b>A Comprehensive Starter Set for Electronics Enthusiasts</b> The 18 Gauge Wire Kit offers an excellent starting point for anyone delving into the realm of electronics, whether as a hobbyist or a budding professional. This kit is particularly appealing for its thoughtful compilation of essential wiring needs, presented in a user-friendly package. Variety and Quality: One of the standout features of this kit is the variety it offers—eight colors of 18 gauge silicone wire, each extending to 23 feet (7 meters). While the length of each spool might not cater to extensive projects, the assortment allows for ample experimentation and small-scale builds. The choice of silicone for the wire sheathing is a commendable one, providing a durable, heat-resistant covering that forgives the occasional soldering mishap, making it an ideal selection for beginners. Additionally, silicone's chemical resistance and flexibility are qualities that veteran electronics enthusiasts will appreciate. Accessories and Utility: The inclusion of color-coordinated heat shrink tubing and zip ties adds a layer of organization and professionalism to projects, enhancing the overall utility of the kit. While the wire stripper may not impress seasoned users, it's a valuable addition for those just starting, offering an all-in-one solution to basic wiring needs. Packaging and Design: The kit's packaging is notably well-conceived, featuring a box with holes for each wire spool, facilitating easy access and storage. This system helps maintain a clean and organized workspace, a boon for any project. However, the opportunity for improvement lies in the visibility of the remaining wire on each spool; a clear plastic window on the box would have perfectly rounded out the design by allowing users to gauge their wire stock at a glance. Conclusion: In summary, the 18 Gauge Wire Kit earns a solid five-star rating not through groundbreaking innovation but through the thoughtful assembly of high-quality components tailored to meet the needs of both novice and experienced electronics enthusiasts. It stands out as a comprehensive and practical kit, perfect for anyone looking to embark on or expand their electronics projects with a reliable selection of wires and tools at their disposal."

Copper is better than aluminum, as (semi) precious metals such as silver, gold , platinum etc. are superior, however, cost prohibitive. 2.copper should be bright and 3. The wire jacket should not show any wear or distinguishable defect with the heat of a cigarette applied to it. Makes sense for scenarios when a fire may be present especially on motor vehicles. 3. Must exhibit moderate to good flexibility. 4.the shielding must be smooth throughout. If not, that means the wire has not been produced be acceptable standards. Unevenness of the wire core may create sliding within the shielding due to looseness created. In my testing this wire meets all these requirements with only a slight mark off for slight mark left after the cigarette test. I think that this is adequate wire for anyone’s build requiring 18 gauge marine grade wire. The tin coated copper is even and well applied. The copper is on the rigid side, however, acceptable for good quality in terms of flexibility.

        "B01K4RPB3O <b>Good quality, high strand-count high flexibility tinned wire with silicone rubber insulation</b> This 22 AWG (gauge) silicone insulated wire is excellent for indoor or protected environments where high flexibility/lack of stiffness, and non-melting (or at least melt resistant) insulation is required. The conductors are a 'high strand count\" type, meaning that instead of being comprised of just a few larger/thicker strands, it is instead comprised of a much greater number of smaller/thinner strands; and this contributes to its lack of stiffness/great flexibility. The other contributing factor to the high flexibility is that the insulation is silicone rubber, rather than the more common PVC (which is rather stiff). This kind of high strand count, silicone rubber insulated wire is exactly what high quality test equipment 'test leads' have been made of for decades. The silicone rubber is also much less heat sensitive than more common insulations such as PVC or \"machine tool wire\". It won't melt off as readily as PVC insulation does if your soldering iron needs to be held onto a joint or terminal for an extended period of time. The fine wire strands are also nicely tinned, and the insulation strips off easily and cleanly, and the stranded wire solders easily. It is a good quality product at an affordable price. HOWEVER, it is not the best choice for many common \"hook up wire\" applications, since its lack of stiffness can be an issue; the strands definitely need to be twisted and soldered in order to keep their shape enough to be formed into a hook before soldering around a terminal for example. This wire also does not want to cooperate if you want to twist a few of them together, because their limpness makes them uncooperative in that regard. And if you use this wire in \"hook up wire\" applications, it wants to just flop into some odd position rather than 'staying put' where you want it to be. Silicone rubber insulation is also not that great when it comes to abrasion resistance, and resistance to some kinds of oils and such where other insulations may be preferable."

        "B0CSD35PQT <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone."

The durability of this wire is outstanding. It's clearly built to withstand the elements, which is essential for any outdoor wiring needs. Installation was a breeze. The wire is flexible enough to maneuver around obstacles in my garden, yet it feels sturdy and reliable. I was particularly concerned about the safety aspect of burying electrical wire, but this product's robust insulation gave me peace of mind. It’s evident that it's designed to prevent moisture, corrosion, and other environmental factors from affecting its performance. The 12AWG size is perfect for my high-powered outdoor lights, providing consistent and stable electricity flow. I've noticed no voltage drops or fluctuations, which speaks volumes about the wire's quality. Additionally, the clarity of markings on the wire made it easy to ensure correct and safe installation. What truly sets this wire apart is its value for money. It's not often you find a product that offers such high quality at a reasonable price. It's a long-term investment that I anticipate will serve me for many years to come. In conclusion, I highly recommend the Zonegrace 12AWG 2-Conductor 12/2 Direct Burial Wire to anyone looking for a reliable, durable, and easy-to-install option for their outdoor electrical projects.

I carefully took a knife to the wire to ensure it is indeed tinned copper wire. I was able to scrap off the tin and expose a nice copper color below (see photo), verifying that this is indeed copper wire. I also measured the wire thickness in several locations and got measurements all around 1.35mm, which is just slightly over the 1.29mm you'd expect with 16 gauge wire. This is good because I'd rather the wire be a bit over 16 gauge in size than a bit under. Altogether this is some good quality 16 gauge tinned copper wire.",

        "B0BY25MWGN <b>Rewired my Shipping Container</b> I recently converted my shipping container to solar and with it came heat. My container had been built to be powered and since I wanted to be off the grid solar is my option. I have a windmill that I will be adding later but for now solar it is. Solar power is hot. Connecting wires to a battery and inverter get hot. Regular wires will not work in this setup and I need thicker wires. I have found that 12 to 4 gauge wires work best for me. Thicker wires connecting the big things and 12 gauge leading to my appliances. This wire is easy to use and is extremely flexible. It is easy to connect and cut. The plastic can take high temps as well as the wire. This wire will help save fuses as other wires I used caused my fuses to pop way to often. The containers are in the high desert so the interior gets hot as it is so good wires are even more important. These are solid wires. If you are looking for a way to convert your cheaper wires into something better check these wires out. They are solid, they can take high heat and they work well.",

        "B0BWMW7F33 <b>Great for DIYers and reasonably priced for copper with silicone insulation</b> The price for copper wire has gone up so dramatically in the last few years, I did a lot of rewiring in my house a few years back and a spool of 12/2 1000 feet Romex was $260 and now over $500 a roll at Lowes or HomeDepot. The prices for these spools are cheaper than similar PVC coated wires at Walmart for 20 gauge wire and these have more expensive silicone coating and tinned copper. Price wise these are very good wires and good for small projects or repairs on electronics. The wire is very flexible and good for replacing cheaper wires in outdoor equipment that are subject to the elements or chemicals. The silicone is good for almost degrees 400F which is great for power and heating equipment as they are more chemical resistant and won't melt as easily. I have two outdoor portable water heaters used for camping and the wiring on the units use the cheaper PVC and the insulation can melt when the heaters are used for extended periods. I have had to wrap the wires in aluminum heat wrap to protect the PVC cables now I can repair them with the silicone wires without having to wrap them with protective aluminum heat shields.",

When an aging battery's acid fumes contaminate the end of the cable with corrosion, sometimes there's no choice but to make a new one, and that's just one place where this works well. I'd also make it my first choice for use on a boat, where soldering the ends and sealing them with heat shrink is pretty much mandatory; the tinned conductors fuse instantly if correctly heated, with just a small amount of additional solder applied.",

        "B0CN9FNFZC <b>Nice well made cable</b> Nice highly flexible 18 gage wire. It is tinned, so if you plan to solder, that is even better. I am using this as a signal wire from remote/pendant mounted switches to control small relays. For this, it is well suited, possibly a little overkill. But I like having a little heavier gage than what it takes just to get the job done. In my experience, it lasts longer and more forgiving to unexpected issues and faults. The outer sheath is not terribly difficult to cut, but I do not think average use will cause damage to it. Probably not suited to use in a manufacturing plant where it would be subjected to many types of abuse. But for the average DIY home entrepreneur, it would likely be just fine. I think we all take better care of things when it is us who foot the bill to pay for them. The individual wires are color coded (think thermostat wire), so they are easily identifiable on each end. As mentioned they are tinned, so the are easily soldered as well. I like soldered connections. They are more trouble to install, but, when properly done, I feel they are extremely reliable and with lower resistance due to more surface contact area. Soldering is not always an option, but these wires will do just fine when crimped as well.",

        "B0C4GXNNBD <b>Works good</b> Its flexible enough and a descent guage copper wire. So it's easy to work with and does a great job. I got this because I needed to run 4 18g wires a considerable distance in a camper van build, and I am using it like 2 sets of standard 12v wire for lighting. Having the jacket acts almost like a wire loom, this added a layer of protection as well as made it much easier to install that running 4 separate wires. How My Star Rating System Works & What They Mean: 1 STAR - Pretty much junk and I would return and ask for a refund if I could. 2 STAR - It works, but barely meets the minimum requirements it should in order to keep it and not return it, but I would not order again. 3 STAR - It does what it was designed to do, but there's nothing really special about it. It's acceptable but not great. 4 STAR - I am very comfortable recommending it to a friend because it is is well made, durable, and delivers on its advertised features, and I would buy it again. 5 STAR - I really love it. The item exceeds my expectations of quality, durability and functionality. Not only would I purchase it again, but I would also actively encourage friends and family to do the same. All of my reviews are my own personal opinion and are completely honest no matter if I receive an item for free or I pay for it. I am an avid Amazon shopper, as well as an Amazon Vine Voice and I personally rely on reading reviews to make all of my buying decisions, so I understand the importance of honest reviews from my peers.",

With 4 strands inside the single casing, this will allow for the 4 contained strands to be pulled without the mess of 4 individual strands being pulled and having to be taped, loomed, or wire tied for wire management. The 4 individual contained wires are also color coded for easy identification on each end of the contained wire.

Its easy to strip the insulation but its not so soft that it tears or can be crushed off the wire easily - I've had silicone insulation that was just to fragile and this is perfect - The slightly tougher insulation is slightly stiffer but its a much better compromise for applications where the wiring won't be completely protected in a sleeve - even inside an enclosure, some of them are too easily damaged and this holds up well. Colors are very solid/bright - no issues there The conductor is very finely stranded and individually tinned strands - very nice construction and easy to work with.

This type of wire is specifically designed for use with low voltage lighting systems and provides a safe and reliable connection for your lights. One of the best things about low voltage landscape wire is its durability. This wire is well-insulated and resistant to weather and moisture, ensuring long-lasting performance in even the harshest outdoor conditions. It is also easy to work with, making it a great choice for DIYers and professionals alike. In addition to its practical benefits, low voltage landscape wire is also very cost-effective. Because it uses less energy than traditional outdoor wiring, it can save you money on your electricity bill over time. And because it is safe to use in wet conditions, you won’t have to worry about costly repairs or replacements due to water damage. Overall, I highly recommend low voltage landscape wire to anyone planning an outdoor lighting project.

While the silicone insulator may be good up to 200ºC, I'd probably stay below 90ºC (194ºF). At 600 volts, this could deliver 8.4kW up to 13.2kW of power, depending on your sensitivity for temperature! But at 12 volts, more like 168 watts. Or 48 volts, 672 watts. Fun stuff, electricity! This has been great to have around while building out USB-C PD devices to run everything in my house but small appliances off of USB-C PD 3.0 and 3.1.

The flexible KWANGIL 16 AWG wire makes this process much easier than the stiffer 18 AWG speaker wire that I had previously been using. As an added bonus, this wire is UV stable and also tinned to protect it from corrosion. And the tinned wire is super easy to solder. KWANGIL even supplies the coil with an end cap on each wire end to keep the wire in perfect condition until it’s ready to be used. The 20 feet of wire is supplied wound in a ~7 ½ inch coil and packaged in a sealed plastic bag. Thanks to the large size of the coil, when the wire is unwrapped it lays fairly flat unlike wire that has been tightly coiled. Stripping the outer jacket was just as easy as the listing said it would be. I stripped 4 inches from one end with no problem. Stripping the individual wires on the other hand isn’t as easy. The insulation on each wire is tight but that also keeps moisture away. Stripping ½ inch took a bit of work, stripping 1 inch I found easiest to do in two ½ inch pieces.

For longer runs, or wires that will carry a lot of amps, use 12 gauge.) Connected both wires to double the length and measured resistance using a good multi-meter. It is less than standard for 14 gauge cooper, so that is good. Flexibility is good. I like that it is US made. Competitively priced.",

        "B09VGLY361 <b>Interesting wire if you never worked with it before, very little voltage drop..</b> I read some reviews before ordering this, so I was aware that this was not your typical multi-strand copper wire that is used in automotive and industrial applications for low DC voltage. I needed 12 gauge wire for a project, and thought I would give this a try. A 20 ft run of this wire supplying 14.3 volts DC with a constant load of 25 amps showed only .15 volts of voltage drop. Comparable multi-strand copper wire in another circuit of the same wire length and specifications was showing a .21 voltage drop. Yes, there could be other items in play that I am not accounting for, but this is just merely indicating that this wire type is not any WORSE of a conductor than what you would normally purchase at the parts store to repair wiring on your vehicle. The added flexibility of the wire seems to be a plus, especially since I was wiring in some off-road lights when it was 15 deg F outside. This wire remained very pliable, unlike its multi-strand copper wire cousin. I see no reason I wouldn't use this again nor any reason why you shouldn't consider it a good option for your automotive wiring needs.",

During my work I used a couple different wire strippers to remove insulation and had no issues, telling me the wire is truly 12ga. The individual strands are quite fine, which can make crimping a minor pain but it does make for super flexible wire, which is what I needed. The silicone insulation is probably not suitable for use in, say, an engine bay, but is very convenient for applications in a more protected environment.

        "B0CV7XP7JN <b>True Marine Grade Tinned Copper Wire</b> So I really wanted to find out what makes good wire. Turns out there’s a few factors when determining a quality wire. 1. Copper is better than aluminum, as (semi) precious metals such as silver, gold , platinum etc. are superior, however, cost prohibitive. 2.copper should be bright and 3. The wire jacket should not show any wear or distinguishable defect with the heat of a cigarette applied to it. Makes sense for scenarios when a fire may be present especially on motor vehicles. 3. Must exhibit moderate to good flexibility. 4.the shielding must be smooth throughout. If not, that means the wire has not been produced be acceptable standards. Unevenness of the wire core may create sliding within the shielding due to looseness created. In my testing this wire meets all these requirements with only a slight mark off for slight mark left after the cigarette test. I think that this is adequate wire for anyone’s build requiring 18 gauge marine grade wire. The tin coated copper is even and well applied. The copper is on the rigid side, however, acceptable for good quality in terms of flexibility. I don’t think you would be disappointed with choosing this, especially, if your other choice is cheaper copper clad aluminum.",

As for any soldering - stuffs great thou higher bond point u can tell its stronger. Any splices r handled with some new solder joint connectors I just happened to snatch up and this stuff worked great in those too. I did find that there is the slight possiblity of tearing open the silicone jacket of this stuff 'easier' over other types due to having easier stripping ability so yankin' on this stuff when routing any wire runs needs to b given some added care to avoid snags on anything sharp. Otherwise some great wire here and worth the lil xtra bidenbux for an overall better quality product.",
        "B0CMLHV3FX <b>Excellent</b> This is an excellent wire from what I can tell so far. The advantage to the silicone insulation is that the wire is more flexible than wire with pvc or other plastic insulation. When tinned or soldered, the silicone doesn't shrivel and melt back like. This wire seemed to require a hotter temp to get solder to flow, but once it reached that point the wire tinned fine. The other advantage to silicone is that it doesn't actually melt, so it can handle high temperatures better. The down side is that silicone is more expensive, but for many applications it may be well worth the added expense. This wire will suit my needs perfectly, I'm very happy with this product."

The outside diameter measures .200 inches. The conductor insulation will withdraw a little from soldering heat as I would expect for more flexible insulations.

Amazon delivered this wire last night and I didn't find it till morning. The package was covered in snow and it was 20F. I opened the package, and this wire was as flexible as it could be. I started to make a cable with it and noticed the two wires split very easily, too easily. With only moderate use this wire will keep separating. The ends should always have a piece of heat shrink tubing at the ends to prevent it from becoming two wires, even when storing. That is partially an effect of the insulation being so flexible. From the picture you can see how many small flexible strands there are. I measured one with my caliper and the reading was 0.002 inches. This is really nice wire to work with because of the extreme flexibility. I took a piece of insulation and hit it with my soldering iron set to 593F. The insulation didn't burn, smoke or even make a dent. This is just super wire to use for higher current applications."

        "B01K4RPB3O <b>Good quality, high strand-count high flexibility tinned wire with silicone rubber insulation</b> This 22 AWG (gauge) silicone insulated wire is excellent for indoor or protected environments where high flexibility/lack of stiffness, and non-melting (or at least melt resistant) insulation is required. The conductors are a 'high strand count\" type, meaning that instead of being comprised of just a few larger/thicker strands, it is instead comprised of a much greater number of smaller/thinner strands; and this contributes to its lack of stiffness/great flexibility. The other contributing factor to the high flexibility is that the insulation is silicone rubber, rather than the more common PVC (which is rather stiff). This kind of high strand count, silicone rubber insulated wire is exactly what high quality test equipment 'test leads' have been made of for decades. The silicone rubber is also much less heat sensitive than more common insulations such as PVC or \"machine tool wire\". It won't melt off as readily as PVC insulation does if your soldering iron needs to be held onto a joint or terminal for an extended period of time. The fine wire strands are also nicely tinned, and the insulation strips off easily and cleanly, and the stranded wire solders easily. It is a good quality product at an affordable price. HOWEVER, it is not the best choice for many common \"hook up wire\" applications, since its lack of stiffness can be an issue; the strands definitely need to be twisted and soldered in order to keep their shape enough to be formed into a hook before soldering around a terminal for example. This wire also does not want to cooperate if you want to twist a few of them together, because their limpness makes them uncooperative in that regard. And if you use this wire in \"hook up wire\" applications, it wants to just flop into some odd position rather than 'staying put' where you want it to be. Silicone rubber insulation is also not that great when it comes to abrasion resistance, and resistance to some kinds of oils and such where other insulations may be preferable."

When you need to splice 2 of them try slightly spreading the wires apart then push the 2 wires together lightly twisting back and forth and they will merge well then squeeze the wires down. it really help to wrap a wire around them after to keep the profile thinner. I have even used the thin soldier to wrap around it so it disappears but thin copper wire does really work well. without anything wrapped around the wires it has decent strength already before it is even soldiered.

Makes running, fishing a tucking a LOT easier. The wire appears to be of good quality and takes solder easy. The best part is the coating around the two internal wires. It is good quality, flexible and well bonded to the internal wires. Definitely recommend this product!",

Took a couple passes with the wire strippers to get it through the outer jacketing. The inner wires jacketing was also thick. You can easily see that this wire can handle being buried if needed. The 18 gauge can also handle quite a bit of current if running lighting (or even speakers). Little on the expensive side...but keep in mind that this cable is made for outdoors and/or direct burial and that is definitely what you are getting for you money. If you need to run a cable outdoors, do yourself a favor and get the right wire to do the job. Nothing worse than trying to save money only to have something short (or catch fire) on something cheaper. This is worth the price for what it does..."

I was impressed by how flexible this wire is and its resistance to high temperatures. With a 200C and 600V rating, it can be used in just about any application. Unlike most stranded wire, there are way too many strands to count, which is the reason why it is so flexible. Unless using a crimp connector, the large number of very flexible strands almost dictates the end should be tinned before making a connection. The insulation was unfazed by direct application of a soldering iron when checking its tinning ability.

The main reason why I chose this wire over cheaper wire variety packs is because this wire has silicone insulation which is more durable, flexible, and heat resistant than conventional wire insulation. The silicone insulation did not disappoint. You can see in the video I attached that the insulation is quite resistant to heat and does not melt as easily. Notice the reaction of the bare wire to heat in the video as well. The wire is indeed tinned and when you heat it, the tinning material evaporates and the bare copper wire is left underneath. This is something you should take into consideration when connecting these wires to a terminal since the tinning should be removed in order to get a solid connection. Probably a regular lighter is more suited to this task than a blow torch. Overall I am very satisfied with this wire kit. The wire is all very high quality and perfect for automotive applications due to the heat and wear resistance of the silicone insulation. This kit also comes with a wire stripper, some zip ties, and heat shrink. I could care less about these extras but it might be a nice perk if you don't have these items already.

        "B0CRYX1P5T <b>Alienhomy 16 Gauge Silicone Wire Review: Flexible and Durable</b> The Alienhomy 16 Gauge 2 Conductor Silicone Wire comes as a highly flexible and durable option for various electrical projects. The silicone casing is both soft and resilient, indicative of quality silicone wire that can withstand a range of environmental factors. While the product claims the use of tinned copper as its conductive material, my efforts to verify this were inconclusive. Despite this, the wire does exhibit characteristics of high-quality conductor wire, including the appearance of a coppery color upon scraping. Given the uncertainty surrounding the confirmation of the tinned copper, I've decided to proceed with its use under the assumption that it meets the product description. The wire's overall feel and performance suggest it's up to the task for applications requiring high flexibility, temperature resistance, and reliability, such as automotive or battery connections. Considering its construction, usability, and the slight uncertainty regarding the material verification, I rate the Alienhomy 16 Gauge Silicone Wire 4 out of 5 stars. It stands as a solid choice for those in need of durable, high-temperature resistant wiring, with a minor reservation about the confirmation of its tinned copper content.",
        "B01M8F9ZVX <b>Works great for creating HT counterpoises.</b> I'm a ham operator and purchased this to construct HT counterpoises. My previous counterpoise was regular insulated copper wire and it became a pain keeping it straight, as to store the 19.5\" wire when not in use you wrap it around the HT. When unwrapping it the wire would retain the bends and would not hang straight down as you want. Trying to smooth it out and remove the bends was pretty much pointless, and it would want to keep curling back. Then when you stowed your HT, it would happen again when you pulled it out again and unwound it. I saw a recommendation to use silicone-insulated wire as it was much more flexible. I gave it a shot, and it is indeed much better for this purpose. The wire retains a little bit of memory when you unwind it, but a few smoothing passes of your hand down it gets it pretty straight, and it will \"loosen up\" even more over time. I get better performance out of this compared to my prior counterpoise, but that could be the result of intentionally going down a wire gauge to a thicker wire, the line staying straighter, the increased number of strands inside compared to the previous wire, the difference in connecting (soldering a wire loop versus using a terminal ring) or a combination of all four.",

The only markings on the wire are the gauge and the 200C (that's 392F) temperature rating. The ad does indicate a 600 volt insulation rating (but this is not marked) and gives a strand count of 252 @ 0.08mm. Of course with the silicone there is no insulation creep from soldering heat. This is good for RC work, and if you need a quantity the per/foot cost is much lower than hobby shop prices where you pay much more for a carded and packaged 3 or 6 foot length. Recommended.",

I tested the resistance of each of the two strands, and both came back exactly 1.2 Ohms resistance, which means two things. #1, most importantly, the wire is not broken internally in either strand, there are no opens. #2, my volt meter is consistently lousy and at least measures off the mark twice equally. What I mean by this is that at this length, according to spec, there should be 15.88 milliohms (mΩ) of resistance in 10' of 12ga copper wire, which is far too sensitive for my cheap meter to measure.

If you are doing nothing more than running speaker wire, then good for you. You should be happy with the cable. If you are running power wire for an appliance, a solar system, or for any standard project other than low voltage battery, you will have to pause and wonder. What is the voltage rating? What is the current rating? Is this really OFC or something else? You can think it is something, but you will NOT know for sure. If you have an inspector ask for the ratings, you are out of luck and will have to rewire your project. The company says that it is 10 GA Oxygen free copper and they say the rating on the insulation is 200V. So, the problems start when you look at Silicon insulation and find that the normal low voltage rating is 600V up to 35,000V. 200V does not appear in any standard. Most oxygen free tinned copper still looks like copper when you cut it. This cable does not do that, even with a magnifying glass. So, how do you know? Nothing on the cable indicates that it is OFC or anything other than 10GA. Ok, once you get that resolved in your mind, this cable is designed like lamp zip cord except it splits way too easily. Great concept, but you will need to secure the cable ends somehow if you do not want it pulling apart. You can use electrical tape, shrink tubing, or even a tie wrap not pulled too tight. The cable itself is very flexible, like you would expect from a silicon wire. For use in a solar system where there is NO ground and you are required to install a breaker on both the negative and the positive side of the supply, this type of cable works very well. In fact, it is the project I started using it on until the Building inspector asked to see the data sheet on the wire or at least the UL number. Since I could not produce it, I had to remove what I had done and switch to a UL rated cable. Does that make this a bad product? No, it only makes it a quesitonable product since you do not know exactly what you have. I have not been able to find a way to directly contact the company to ask for a spec sheet. I just hope they watch the reviews and can provide the requested item, then this would be a product I would recommend. Until then, I cannot recommend it."

        "B0CN9FNFZC <b>Nice well made cable</b> Nice highly flexible 18 gage wire. It is tinned, so if you plan to solder, that is even better. I am using this as a signal wire from remote/pendant mounted switches to control small relays. For this, it is well suited, possibly a little overkill. But I like having a little heavier gage than what it takes just to get the job done. In my experience, it lasts longer and more forgiving to unexpected issues and faults. The outer sheath is not terribly difficult to cut, but I do not think average use will cause damage to it. Probably not suited to use in a manufacturing plant where it would be subjected to many types of abuse. But for the average DIY home entrepreneur, it would likely be just fine. I think we all take better care of things when it is us who foot the bill to pay for them. The individual wires are color coded (think thermostat wire), so they are easily identifiable on each end. As mentioned they are tinned, so the are easily soldered as well. I like soldered connections. They are more trouble to install, but, when properly done, I feel they are extremely reliable and with lower resistance due to more surface contact area. Soldering is not always an option, but these wires will do just fine when crimped as well."

They might have a single strand of copper in each wire, and the rest be aluminum, but they are certainly not predominantly copper. The wire strands look and feel nothing like solid copper. Enter Shonsin brand, who I only recently discovered. I ordered this 10AWG cable hoping that for once it might be what was actually advertised, and for once I was pleasantly surprised ! Real solid copper strands, great flexibility, wire gauge to specification, nice flexible silicone sheath that doesn't shrink back when soldering or using heatshrink with a heatgun. Exactly what it should be. The outer diameter of the 10AWG wire was a little larger than ideal for part of my project (my fault for not checking, since it's EXACTLY as they list in their description and sizing/gauge table), and since for that specific use I can get away with 12AWG electrically, I just placed an order for some of their 12AWG cable too. I'm still using the 10AWG cable where the size permits, and will just use the 12AWG for the wires that needs to pass through a small grommet. Hopefully the 12AWG wire is just as good as the 10AWG that I'm already using.

        "B0CSD35PQT <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone."

I was soldering this to copper-coated steel clips, so I was really doggin' the heat to it to get a good joint, and the insulation which was butted to the terminals didn't shrink back or burn at all. So this is a really nice, super-flexible, heat-resistant cable for a great price.

I've now ordered this 16 Gauge, UL 2464 Tinned Copper Stranded Wire for LED Lighting in 3 different flavors. I got the 3 wire / conductor, the 5 wire, and now the 4 wire. The 5 wire is great for LEDs with a DC dimmer (AC - hot, neutral, ground & DC positive, negative for my dimmer switch). Boom! all done 1 cable. I got this 4 wire for my third LED high bay; I already had an available ground in the rafters next to the fixture. I ran the cable down and 2 AC wires (hot to toggle switch, neutral to neutral) & 2 wires for DC dimmer. Done. The 3 wire I used for my first High Bay - I had another two wire cable for the DC dimmer. I had to zip-tie those two together. This 3 wire cable is all you need for a non-dimmable LED or an LED fixture that uses AC dimmer technology. The wire is - nice supple / pliable PVC insulated 1/4\" outside diameter 16 gauge tinned copper. The Engineering Tool Box specs this wire at 6 amp carrying capacity up to 1000v @ 30 deg. C (86 F) ambient temperature. There is a .71 correction factor for temperatures between 41 - 45 deg. C (105 - 113 deg. F) So: 6(amps) x .71 = 4.26 4.26 amps is enough amperage for (3) 150w LED lamps. I'm using each cable for one fixture – I prefer to have the amperage up there for additions and the extra cost is minimal. I don't mind the extra cost for the marine rated tinned copper, but this company sells the same cable in the non-tinned flavor also. This is quality cable and makes for quick easy installations.

Wire assortment had matching colors, and same 18-Gauge but the strands were so fine they wouldn't push into the press connectors, just crumpled up. I tinned / soldered the leads and that worked fine. I actually expected this because it wasn't solid wire, which I would have preferred but the wire in the fan housing was all stranded. The original stranded wire in the fan box was stiff enough (thicker and therefore less strands) to push in without soldering. But it worked fine and the neighbor is very happy.

        "B001EX57ZK <b>Strong, Galvanized, Multipurpose</b> I recently purchased a roll of OOK 50143 Solid Utility Wire for a variety of DIY projects around my home. I’ve been very impressed with its versatility, durability, and ease of use. The wire is made of galvanized steel, which makes it resistant to rust and corrosion. It’s also quite strong and can be used for a wide range of tasks, from bundling cables to hanging plants. I’ve used the wire to secure my garden hose, hang bird feeders, and even create a makeshift trellis for my climbing plants. It’s been up to the task in every situation. The wire is also very easy to use. It’s soft and pliable, so you can easily bend and shape it with your hands. I’ve found that it’s much easier to work with than some of the stiffer utility wires I’ve used in the past. Overall, I’m very pleased with the OOK 50143 Solid Utility Wire. It’s a versatile, durable, and easy-to-use product that’s perfect for a variety of DIY projects. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality utility wire",

        "B096JZCT1B <b>Fits the bill for the job</b> I’m a DIYer who recently ran a new five-conductor thermostat wire in preparation for adding a smart thermostat at an existing forced hot air furnace installation. I bought the 50 foot spool of thermostat wire for that project from a big box store. This item’s packaging, in contrast, comes in a cardboard box of significantly smaller dimension than the big box store’s spool of wire, which was in a clear plastic bag. As seen in the photo, the box is maybe 5 inches square and about a couple inches tall. I gave some thought to this. If I were an HVAC contractor, I think the smaller footprint of this item’s design would be a better approach for easy storage when in the field. But the downside to this is the wire’s coiled memory may make fishing the wire a bit more challenging than the wider diameter of the big box version. Aside from this interesting but probably trivial difference, this item seems perfect for its intended purpose. It strips well with the usual wire stripper tools. Continuity was verified with all five conductors. The conductors’ colors match industry standard. Coming from the aforesaid DIYer here, I guess you can take that with a healthy grain of salt :) but I think we’re on page that this the right design for thermostats needing five conductors. I intend to use this item to re-wire an existing smart thermostat installation at a different property, where the existing wiring is rather amusing but functional. I think this item is up to the task and look forward to using it. I think it will also serve me well when I take on some nifty Arduino project with external sensors that need to be wired up. All kinds of cool possibilities here. Glad I picked this item."

This has 5 fifty foot rolls of 5 colors that should end the scrounging. This is a copper clad aluminum core (CCA) wire. The copper reduces corrosion caused by moisture and oxidation and adds surface conductivity. I got it to use for some small 12V wiring projects in the RV (additional 12 volt computer fan for gas refrigerator cooling) and to have on hand when I just need some short lengths of wire. For reference, Cu Clad Al (CCA) wire can be used for main wire projects but at a much larger gauge as aluminum has a higher resistance than copper. 12 AWG is recommended for a 15 Amp 110V circuit and 10 AWG for a 20 Amp. This is a 36 strand 16 AWG braided wire so it's not made for heavy loads or 110 volt wiring. Specs are for up to 80 volts. The wire is flexible and there's enough copper coating for it to solder easily to itself. If there's trouble having the wire stick, a copper infused solder works. I used some lead free Rosin Core 2.0 Sn99 Ag0.3 Cu0.7 electronics solder and everything was sucked into the wire and stuck together. I couldn't find the percent by weight of copper anywhere on the rolls, package, or website. The range for CCA is anywhere from 10% to 24% by weight, with the more the better (but also more expensive). 15 small zip ties and 10 heat shrink tubes are included in the box. I'm never going to use this on a main AC wiring project but for small electrical projects, it's a good economical choice and should last a long time. If you don't want 5 colors and a dispenser box, 4-color roll packages of 100'/roll 16AWG of this brand are the same price if you shop around. 4 stars - copper specs not given."

If one is using solid wire, then the connect can safely be removed and reused. So plan well when connecting them.

The problem is, there were several points where 6 wires needed to be joined. The red nuts that were used are not rated for more than 4 12-guage wires. Evidently, the electrician tried to compensate for that by twisting the wires together with pliers or something, but the connection was still flaky, which resulted in some flickering lights and unreliable outlets. These Gardner Bender blue wire nuts fixed the problem completely! I took the old small red wire nuts off in every place where I saw more than 4 wires being joined, then put these on, twisted by hand with a pretty strong force until I was not able to twist anymore, then closed all the boxes and tested with an electrical tester. All the connections were solid - no more flickering lights or unreliable outlets. I definitely recommend blue Gardner Bender wire nuts in every place where 5 to 6 common household wires (12 AWG) need to be joined together. The nuts are quite large, so keep that in mind. Typically I envision them being needed for neutral connections, as all neutrals typically go together while the hots are wired to different switches.",

However that deal features PVC (Poly Vinyl Chloride) covered wires and not silicone. The main reason why I prefer the silicone covered wires is because Silicone handles high temps really well and is flame / high heat resistant whereas PVC has a tendency to catch on fire. Silicone covered wires may have a softer feel to them and will actually feel much different compared to the traditional PVC covered wires your used to buying but at the end of the silicone is superior to PVC in a lot of ways so to each his own. The other feature that I preferred over this particular deal over the PVC covered wires option was the fact that these wires are ''tinned copper\" which, from what my research has told me, is that that feature helps with durability and longevity of the wires itself so there you have it.

Well, decades later I am experienced and educated about thermostat wire cable. Very, very, rarely is the problem caused by bad thermostat wire cable itself. The thermostat wire problem is always caused by a person doing something wrong: stapling through the thermostat cable, shorting the conductors across a power transformer, crushing the thermostat wire cable between boards or vents, cutting the thermostat wire cable with a weed wacker, and etc.. Of course, I use a special staple gun that installs high arch staples that will not crush the thermostat wire cable. I run “loose” runs that can be “stretched” when necessary.

It has an SOOW 600V rating and is designed for use with motor leads, portable lights, battery chargers, stage lights, and machinery. One thing that I appreciate about this cable is its flexibility. Even though it is made from thick, heavy duty wire, it remains easy to bend and maneuver. This has made it very convenient for me to use in a variety of different applications. Additionally, the three conductor design makes it easy to connect to devices that require multiple inputs. Overall, I would definitely recommend the GearIT 14/3 14 AWG Portable Power Cable to anyone in need of a reliable and versatile electrical cord. It has exceeded my expectations in terms of quality and performance and I have no doubt that it will continue to serve me well for years to come."

SO why is your product 3x as much as the cheapest and 2x as the next one down? I thought clearly it meant superior product right?? But noooo. Only 2 minutes after firmly pressing down the tape on my already clean and dry walls, i started hearing the dreading peeling crackling sound just slowly going on for several minutes. I'm like are you on or you off? Make up your mind! SO I just wanted to wait it out, for review purposes. It lasted a full 7 minutes before completely unraveling itself. So I pushed it back, pressing it harder and waited, that came off in about 3 minutes. What is the point if it won't stick at all? So I then had to carefully roll it back to fit in the hole provided in the box so I could send this back for return. I'm hoping the return is accepted, I'm sorry that it can't work out. I tried. Unfortunately, I'll be going with the nail clips which are a bit more time consuming but will be permanent. But fortunately, it will look a lot cleaner and I won't need to paint it, (so not really longer) since my moulding is also white. if I decide to sell the house, the next person will be treated to pre wired home theatre. Sewell makes some good quality products. I bought their banana plugs and I think they were easy to use and had a nice package to keep them stored for later.

The outer sheath is not terribly difficult to cut, but I do not think average use will cause damage to it. Probably not suited to use in a manufacturing plant where it would be subjected to many types of abuse. But for the average DIY home entrepreneur, it would likely be just fine. I think we all take better care of things when it is us who foot the bill to pay for them. The individual wires are color coded (think thermostat wire), so they are easily identifiable on each end. As mentioned they are tinned, so the are easily soldered as well. I like soldered connections.

So easily in fact that it was almost impossible to terminate in an RJ-45 plug.

It looks and feels great to the touch; much better than the cloth covered wire from back in the day. I suspect the reason is that the modern 'cloth' contains some synthetics that weren't available 75 years ago. But this wire fits in fine with genuine vintage items, and this cloth is much more durable than the old stuff. I will be using it to rewire an old vintage lamp to get rid of the vinyl/plastic modern wire. I think it is a good choice to re-wire a valuable antique item as well. This wire is flexible but not as limp as most appliance wire. At first I thought the reason must be solid copper instead of stranded copper inside, which would be very strange. It's stranded not solid, however, and the lack of limpness is because the black-coated and white-coated copper stranded wires inside are embedded in a PVC 'cord' that is completely solid. In other words, there isn't a PVC tubing containing the 2 inner wires but rather a solid mass of PVC. Thus the whole thing is sturdier and heftier than it would be if it were a cloth covering over a PVC tubing containing 2 wires. Well done, as the resulting heft makes this wire seem substantial which adds a beautiful aesthetic to any vintage item. Once my re-wiring job is done if I learn any more I'll come back and edit this review."

        "B0BRN8DWTL <b>Beautiful wire</b> I recently purchased the Helunsi 32.8ft Cloth Covered Lamp Cord to rewire the lamp sockets on an antique Wurlitzer jukebox and I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed with this product. The quality of the cord is excellent - the cloth covering feels durable and gives the cord a vintage look that almost perfectly matches the original. I can't wait to get some time to continue my restoration and install this eye candy in my jukebox. The covering on this wire appears to be braided very well and the ends were taped which ensured that it arrived without any frayed fibers. This wire is round, whereas the original was kind of flat, however, given the price ($17.99 .55/ft at time of review), this wire is a bargain and while it may not be exact, it is much safer than the 75 year old wire that is in it, and it looks just as good. Overall, I highly recommend the Helunsi 32.8ft Cloth Covered Lamp Cord for anyone looking to make a vintage looking lamp or rewire an antique. It is a high-quality product that is sure to make your project standout"

This is actually thicker than anything I have ever used before on my electric fence installations. This is more than enough to bury under my gates and entrances. The advantage of using this wire is that I can bury it under all driveways and walk through gates and not worry about it being harmed over time. When I open a gate the electric fence can stay energized around the entire property without breaking the connection. Those spring loaded handles you use to break the wire and open a gate often rust out and fail. I will still use these to energize the gate itself but now I know the rest of the property is energized while I come and go. And I also have enough of this wire left over to run ground wires to my experiments and projects in my electronics lab. At only 56 Ohm per mile it will make a very solid ground."

The ice slab slides onto the cutting grid with enough energy to make a considerable \"thud\" that can be hear in the next room. I attribute the failed wire to this aggressive blow from the ice slab. I bought this wire vs paying the 200 dollars (plus shipping) for the entire cutting grid assembly from Marvel. This wire matched the factory wire in diameter (close enough). I didn't compare the ohm value of the new wire to the factory wire. I just knew the combined resistance of the parallel grids needed to be between 3.9-4.5 ohms. Stringing the failed grid took some trial and error (first attempt, i broke the wire). I eventually got a method to tighten each \"run\". The overall resistance was right at 4.5 ohms. The wire is tough and reasonably difficult to break. I was pulling the runs with hemostatic clamps and the wire held up. I only broke it when i was attempting to wrap around a screw too aggressively.

I'm not sure the Amazon listing made it clear that this is UL approved, but it is. I measured the outside diameter at .225\", and peeling back the Rayon cover reveals a round white PVC jacket that is .210\" diameter. The PVC makes this cord rugged but also quite stiff compared to true antique (and less safe) cloth-covered cord that was usually just one or two cloth layers wound directly over the two individually-insulated conductors, but without the extra molded PVC jacket. Vintage cord used on lamps, radios, and other electrical devices usually was a little less bulky, more flexible and sometimes had an oval cross-section rather than round. This cord is well-suited for modern retro lighting and restoration applications where extreme flexibility and the ability to hang naturally under its own weight over short lengths is not a requirement. For greater flexibility, twisted cloth-covered cord is available from other sources. This has each PVC coated conductor individually wrapped in cloth and the pair of wires twisted together, yielding greater flexibility. Several years ago I had to buy cord like this for an antique replica that I built, and I paid a lot more buying it from an antique radio part supplier. This is a high quality product with safety approvals at a very good price. Highly recommended."

I do a LOT of small electrical jobs for friends and family, everything from fixing headlights and wiring harnesses, to adding completely new circuits like heated seats or sound systems. I have 0 sound degradation when I use them for speaker wire. If you use it for that, something I've learned by a lot of real world trial and error, that may help someone else out there, is to run the speaker wires down the opposite side of the car you run the power wires; I don't know why it helps, someone who's smarter than I could tell you..maybe it helps cut out interference or something, but tbh I have no idea at all and am not educated enough on that to tell you the why, I just know that it really works. It's almost like some kind of weird, ancient, wiring feng-shui that yields better performance based on geographical location. Supernatural, ancient, far-east, geo-kinestethic techniques and practices aside, it really just helps get the desired result of clear, non-fuzzy sound... ...Ok! anyways, the crazy flexibility and high-strand count of the conductor inside the insulation makes it stupid dumb easy to push em through tight fitting holes without the need to alter the existing structure of something. They're surprisingly elastic, as well, which helps not tear off end bits of wire if you're like me and use an automatic wire stripper... and insist on having the tension permanently set to \"kill\" 😃. The elasticity of the insulation, which is made of/made with with silicone, also means if it gets caught while you run it, you step on it or slam it in something while pulling the wire, that won't (in my experience) compromise the conductor inside. I know that I SHOULD just replace that section of wire, even if it doesn't appear to be damaged, which I do when time and materials allow... and I know I SHOULD stop eating so much red meat, I know I SHOULD stop smoking, I know I SHOULD finally fix that back door screen that bangs every time the wind blows any faster than is required to move a stupid American Beauty grocery bag... my point is that I SHOULD do a lot of things, but don't always get to. in the real world sometimes you just aren't able to do things by the book, for whatever reason, and this wire hasn't let me down when those situations arise. I'll leave you with my answer to the question \"is this **** good enough to be the only wire ill use for automotive and small electronic applications moving forward?\"... ...\"bet\".

The advantage of using this wire is that I can bury it under all driveways and walk through gates and not worry about it being harmed over time.

        "B09VGLY361 <b>Easy to work with for small projects.</b> I needed some very thin gauge wire to do some small low volt DC projects with. The quality of wire wasn’t as important for this so I didn’t mind taking a chance on an unknown brand. So far, this seems to be as good as anything I can source locally, and 10 cents a foot keeps the price competitive. I like the silicone jacket. It makes the wire very easy to work with. I was worried it wouldn’t hold up as well to the heat of soldering, but I was very careful and had no issues. It was too small to really use a crimp connector so I did mostly soldering and heat shrink. The tinned wire took solder well and I didn’t have any issues with connectivity or creating a solid connection. I didn’t have my calipers handy to check this versus other 20 AWG wire but it seemed comparable. Even so, sometime manufactures use more insulation and less metal to give it the impression that it is the same size. With wire I am unfamiliar with, I always size up against the standard AWG amp ratings just to be safe. It’s hard to say if the jacket will hold up to harsh conditions. For my purposes, it’s being used inside an enclosure and is well-protected. If you’re going to use this for automotive, marine or exterior projects, I’d leave a piece of wire outside for a while to test it before committing to a full project. Overall, a good value wire option if you don’t have a power hungry circuit where only the best will do."

Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful."

Working with high-flexibility and heat-resistant silicone wire is a treat compared to PVC-insulated wire, but the higher cost usually makes me limit its use to special projects where there is a great deal of repetitive flexing or where it is necessary to ensure that no stresses are imposed on the joint, such as when soldering to the pads of a circuit board. I would prefer to use silicone wire for everything otherwise. You can punch holes in the cardboard box and use it as a wire dispenser.

Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white).

        "B09VGLY361 <b>Easy to work with for small projects.</b> I needed some very thin gauge wire to do some small low volt DC projects with. The quality of wire wasn’t as important for this so I didn’t mind taking a chance on an unknown brand. So far, this seems to be as good as anything I can source locally, and 10 cents a foot keeps the price competitive. I like the silicone jacket. It makes the wire very easy to work with. I was worried it wouldn’t hold up as well to the heat of soldering, but I was very careful and had no issues. It was too small to really use a crimp connector so I did mostly soldering and heat shrink. The tinned wire took solder well and I didn’t have any issues with connectivity or creating a solid connection. I didn’t have my calipers handy to check this versus other 20 AWG wire but it seemed comparable. Even so, sometime manufactures use more insulation and less metal to give it the impression that it is the same size. With wire I am unfamiliar with, I always size up against the standard AWG amp ratings just to be safe. It’s hard to say if the jacket will hold up to harsh conditions. For my purposes, it’s being used inside an enclosure and is well-protected. If you’re going to use this for automotive, marine or exterior projects, I’d leave a piece of wire outside for a while to test it before committing to a full project. Overall, a good value wire option if you don’t have a power hungry circuit where only the best will do.",

Not only is it flexible, but my soldering won't scorch the silicone like it will PVC jacketed wire, as silicone has a much higher tolerance for heat than PVC. I tested the resistance of each of the two strands, and both came back exactly 1.2 Ohms resistance, which means two things. #1, most importantly, the wire is not broken internally in either strand, there are no opens. #2, my volt meter is consistently lousy and at least measures off the mark twice equally. What I mean by this is that at this length, according to spec, there should be 15.88 milliohms (mΩ) of resistance in 10' of 12ga copper wire, which is far too sensitive for my cheap meter to measure. So I don't know why my meter is reading 1.2 ohms, but my guess is that is not exactly correct, and the actual resistance is functionally closer to 0 ohms. Anyway, this wire is perfect for chaining together a few LiFePO4 12V batteries in parallel for a solar-charged power station I'm building. Just got to crimp some spade terminals on and it will be perfect for my project. Also, LOL at the brand name... Dastard?? lol really?"

        "B0BYNNJS8B <b>Good Quality, High Temp Wire</b> I work on a lot of electronics requiring 12-gauge wire and recently procured this wire for a couple of my projects. I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful."

After a minute of flame contact, the insulation was chalky and white over about 1/2 inch, and the 1/4 inch that was directly in the flame was significantly weakened. The bottom part that got the most heat was easily peeled off with a fingernail. The top part lost about half its thickness, becoming the white chalky powder that didn’t stay attached, but the lower layers were still functional insulation. The insulation that was right next to the flame lost its gloss but stayed flexible and fairly tough. The portion of insulation just 1/2 inch away from the flame was completely unaffected despite probably reaching a few hundred degrees F in temperature. Seriously impressive results for generic wire, and this appears to be actual silicone insulation. The usual concern I have with off-brand wire like this is that the insulation will have one of a few common problems: the most common is being excessively thick to give the impression that the wire is lower-gauge than it actually is, and then it’s made very soft to keep it flexible so it ends up weak and vulnerable to damage. The other common problem I’ve found is thin, hard insulation and coarse wire stranding so the wire has too much “memory,” making it a pain to work with while still not offering much toughness. This wiring is in the middle, with a good moderate insulation thickness, fine strands, and what seems to be a good balance of flexibility and protection from the insulation.

It pulled about 900ma which means for that length of wire (eye-balled not measured) resistance is about 13 ohms. It glowed bright red. Note that wire increases in resistance as it is heated so this measurement will be higher than with an ohmmeter. I wrapped it around a pair of needle-nose pliers and pulled until it gave way. It required a few pounds of tension. Easily strong enough to use to cut Styrofoam, my opinion. I don't think copper will like the heat of a direct connection. For cutting Styrofoam, I think I would wrap it around a small length of steel wire and then push it through a steel butt connector and clamp it tight. Then attach the copper wire to the steel wire.",
        "B0BTHHGLFY <b>These seem to be pretty good quality wires.</b> I cut off a short section. The wires are copper. Check. I put the section on a steel plate and put the torch to it. The wire insulation began to smoke a bit, then finally ignited. But it extinguished as soon as I withdrew the torch. So, with that, this is good wire intended to carry current. There are a lot of these wires out there labeled as electrical, but they are really speaker wire and the insulation, if it catches fire, burns by itself since it is a fuel to support combustion. So, good electrical wire at a very good price.",

        "B0CMLHV3FX <b>Assortment of colors makes it easy to keep circuits identifiable</b> This is a set of 6 different colors of tinned copper wire that came on individual spools. This is a great set to have on hand for use with projects that I will need to wire in the future. The colors of the silicone covering is easily visible and identify. I'm have not used wire with thus type of shielding before so I was skeptical. I opened one spool and put it to the test. I knew that tinned wire was easier to solder and offered less resistance and works great for wiring projects. What I didn't know was the silicone covering. After opening the spool I found the covering to be very flexible. It was more maneuverable the other wire I had worked with. It kind of felt like plastic and rubber blended together. It claimed it would withstand high heat and extreme cold. I used my lighter and it took a long time to melt the silicone. I then put the wire in the freezer and after freezing it was still very pliable. This set also came with different colored zip ties so if you need to keep different wires together in a group going to one place these come in handy. This is a great set to keep on hand and I'm sure you will be happy with every project you use them on. They offer so much more then other wire's I've used in the past"

        "B0BYNNJS8B <b>Good Quality, High Temp Wire</b> I work on a lot of electronics requiring 12-gauge wire and recently procured this wire for a couple of my projects. I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful."

        "B0CRYX1P5T <b>Alienhomy 16 Gauge Silicone Wire Review: Flexible and Durable</b> The Alienhomy 16 Gauge 2 Conductor Silicone Wire comes as a highly flexible and durable option for various electrical projects. The silicone casing is both soft and resilient, indicative of quality silicone wire that can withstand a range of environmental factors. While the product claims the use of tinned copper as its conductive material, my efforts to verify this were inconclusive. Despite this, the wire does exhibit characteristics of high-quality conductor wire, including the appearance of a coppery color upon scraping. Given the uncertainty surrounding the confirmation of the tinned copper, I've decided to proceed with its use under the assumption that it meets the product description. The wire's overall feel and performance suggest it's up to the task for applications requiring high flexibility, temperature resistance, and reliability, such as automotive or battery connections. Considering its construction, usability, and the slight uncertainty regarding the material verification, I rate the Alienhomy 16 Gauge Silicone Wire 4 out of 5 stars. It stands as a solid choice for those in need of durable, high-temperature resistant wiring, with a minor reservation about the confirmation of its tinned copper content.",
        "B0BWGXD6BW <b>Super flexible with extreme temperature rating</b> This wire uses solid tin-plated copper conductors and has a very high strand count for extreme flexibility. Although I don't see any voltage rating printed on the wire, the silicone insulation is quite thick compared to some other 16-gauge silicone wires that I have used. The outside diameter measures 3mm. The only markings on the wire are the gauge and the 200C (that's 392F) temperature rating. The ad does indicate a 600 volt insulation rating (but this is not marked) and gives a strand count of 252 @ 0.08mm. Of course with the silicone there is no insulation creep from soldering heat. This is good for RC work, and if you need a quantity the per/foot cost is much lower than hobby shop prices where you pay much more for a carded and packaged 3 or 6 foot length. Recommended.",

        "B0CMTTT3PR <b>Actually heat resistant, at least short-term, and insulation is good thickness and softness</b> With this being sold as silicone insulation, I tested it for heat resistance by holding the end directly in a gas stove flame for one minute. After a minute of flame contact, the insulation was chalky and white over about 1/2 inch, and the 1/4 inch that was directly in the flame was significantly weakened. The bottom part that got the most heat was easily peeled off with a fingernail. The top part lost about half its thickness, becoming the white chalky powder that didn’t stay attached, but the lower layers were still functional insulation. The insulation that was right next to the flame lost its gloss but stayed flexible and fairly tough. The portion of insulation just 1/2 inch away from the flame was completely unaffected despite probably reaching a few hundred degrees F in temperature. Seriously impressive results for generic wire, and this appears to be actual silicone insulation. The usual concern I have with off-brand wire like this is that the insulation will have one of a few common problems: the most common is being excessively thick to give the impression that the wire is lower-gauge than it actually is, and then it’s made very soft to keep it flexible so it ends up weak and vulnerable to damage. The other common problem I’ve found is thin, hard insulation and coarse wire stranding so the wire has too much “memory,” making it a pain to work with while still not offering much toughness. This wiring is in the middle, with a good moderate insulation thickness, fine strands, and what seems to be a good balance of flexibility and protection from the insulation. It’s still on the soft side, but feels like it will be fairly tough. It still definitely feels like cheap wire to me, but it’s a good price and it should get the job done.",

I secured the extra ends of the wire and two kiln shelf columns and fired everything as glaze ware. Pros: +the wire held and the beads fired without the wire breaking or melting. Cons: -after cooling the kiln, the twisted wire was so brittle that it broke upon picking it up and some small pieces got utterly stuck by the glazed, so had to carefully Dremel those areas. -because of this, the wire has become understood to be a one-time use only, so that cost of having the buy more wire eventually adds up over time.

Then when we would strip it, we got fiberglass everywhere, which was a minor annoyance. The worst part was trying to singe the fabric so it wasn't around the actual wire when we made the connection. Obviously, since this wire is high-temp rated that was a chore. I give it four stars because I'm pretty sure I misused what this wire was meant for, and probably didn't know of the proper way to strip it.

People that gave it low reviews do to the small individual strands of wire don't understand how electricity flows through wire. Multiple small conductor strands of wire can flow more amperage through them than the same gauge of wire with 1 large conductor of wire or with the same gauge of wire made with multiple strands of large conductors. The reason why is because electricity flows in a field around the conductors and not through the conductor. So when you have wire wire made of many small strands it has a larger surface area for the electricity to flow around.",

Four stars but that is half based on the competitive price of $26 for 30ft 10ga. If you are looking for fine strand flexibility, this is great. If you require a high voltage rating or other confidence in the performance of the insulation then you should look elsewhere"

Not only is it flexible, but my soldering won't scorch the silicone like it will PVC jacketed wire, as silicone has a much higher tolerance for heat than PVC. I tested the resistance of each of the two strands, and both came back exactly 1.2 Ohms resistance, which means two things. #1, most importantly, the wire is not broken internally in either strand, there are no opens. #2, my volt meter is consistently lousy and at least measures off the mark twice equally. What I mean by this is that at this length, according to spec, there should be 15.88 milliohms (mΩ) of resistance in 10' of 12ga copper wire, which is far too sensitive for my cheap meter to measure. So I don't know why my meter is reading 1.2 ohms, but my guess is that is not exactly correct, and the actual resistance is functionally closer to 0 ohms. Anyway, this wire is perfect for chaining together a few LiFePO4 12V batteries in parallel for a solar-charged power station I'm building.

The high temp insulation makes it nice for soldering, it doesn't shrink off or split out from the heat of nearby soldering - and the temp range is also low (cold). I didn't test it, but the low end spec is -76F.. (So obviously I'd have something special around to make any claim about testing it anywhere near that.) I'll have to pickup a couple new rolls for my next trip to Antarctica (lol).

I would say it is my fault for firing pieces on a product I wasn't certain about but I look back now and see this is Amazon and the suppliers fault for 1) Amazon recommending this product as \"Amazon's Choice\" and 2) The manufacturer's false advertising of this material as a \"HIGH TEMP\", \"NICHROME\", AND \"1200C RESISTANCE\" when it in fact is not. I'm assuming it works for lower temps however it is definitely not made to stand to its description of 1200C (AKA cone 6)!! Overall don't waste your time with this product. Just stick to KEMPER. Side Note - I acknowledge that some customers used this product and had no issues. However this is not a good justification for purchasing it as I did. The fact of the matter is that a business should be selling their products consistently and as advertised, there should not be this much discourse into if a product is true to its claims!!"

However that deal features PVC (Poly Vinyl Chloride) covered wires and not silicone. The main reason why I prefer the silicone covered wires is because Silicone handles high temps really well and is flame / high heat resistant whereas PVC has a tendency to catch on fire. Silicone covered wires may have a softer feel to them and will actually feel much different compared to the traditional PVC covered wires your used to buying but at the end of the silicone is superior to PVC in a lot of ways so to each his own. The other feature that I preferred over this particular deal over the PVC covered wires option was the fact that these wires are ''tinned copper\" which, from what my research has told me, is that that feature helps with durability and longevity of the wires itself so there you have it.

I believe my issue is that my basement fluctuates from low 60's to mid 70's and had the vents on the ceiling near the walls. The vent blows hot when the walls are cold. Doesn't seem great for varying temperatures. the other soffit where the ghost wire runs is opposite side of the drywall from another vent.. Cleaning your walls has a huge difference. While I cleaned mine, I've seen many people have issues who did not wash their walls before installation and have had troubles with sticking. Great idea and good implementation, could be improved on but still better than seeing wires if you cant run them appropriately."

I tested the wire's resistance and per the American Wire Gauge (AWG) Table, I should get 6.4 ohms resistance per 1000 feet of 18 gauge wire. I don't have a multimeter sensitive enough to measure just 23 feet of wire as in this kit, but my multimeter was bouncing between .1 and .2 ohms. Right in the ballpark of .14 ohms for 23 feet that I calculate I should have. Sorry I didn't have enough hands to measure the wire and get a picture too. I also held the wire over a flame for several seconds. The insulation stood up just fine without and visible damage to the wire. The wire itself is very flexible and I like the silicone insulation. I didn't think too much of the little wire stripper/cutter included in the kit. But, it will work if you don't already have proper tools. The little zip ties are handy, but so few won't last too long! One more thing is I thought the kit is a little spendy for what you get. But, if you need several colors of wire, but not much of it, this may work for you. Better than buying several larger rolls that you don't end up using most of.

        "B01K4RPB3O <b>Good quality, high strand-count high flexibility tinned wire with silicone rubber insulation</b> This 22 AWG (gauge) silicone insulated wire is excellent for indoor or protected environments where high flexibility/lack of stiffness, and non-melting (or at least melt resistant) insulation is required. The conductors are a 'high strand count\" type, meaning that instead of being comprised of just a few larger/thicker strands, it is instead comprised of a much greater number of smaller/thinner strands; and this contributes to its lack of stiffness/great flexibility. The other contributing factor to the high flexibility is that the insulation is silicone rubber, rather than the more common PVC (which is rather stiff). This kind of high strand count, silicone rubber insulated wire is exactly what high quality test equipment 'test leads' have been made of for decades. The silicone rubber is also much less heat sensitive than more common insulations such as PVC or \"machine tool wire\". It won't melt off as readily as PVC insulation does if your soldering iron needs to be held onto a joint or terminal for an extended period of time. The fine wire strands are also nicely tinned, and the insulation strips off easily and cleanly, and the stranded wire solders easily. It is a good quality product at an affordable price. HOWEVER, it is not the best choice for many common \"hook up wire\" applications, since its lack of stiffness can be an issue; the strands definitely need to be twisted and soldered in order to keep their shape enough to be formed into a hook before soldering around a terminal for example. This wire also does not want to cooperate if you want to twist a few of them together, because their limpness makes them uncooperative in that regard. And if you use this wire in \"hook up wire\" applications, it wants to just flop into some odd position rather than 'staying put' where you want it to be. Silicone rubber insulation is also not that great when it comes to abrasion resistance, and resistance to some kinds of oils and such where other insulations may be preferable."

I got out some Southwire Romex and compared the two. This Arizona branded wire was nearly identical. The outer jacket was cut and pulled back and the wire stripped just as easily as the Romex. The only difference I really noticed was the outer jacket of the Romex felt more slick or slippery to the Arizona wire. It might matter a little bit if you are trying to pull it through 10 studs at once or so, but I don't think it would be a big difference. Overall, this wire seems to be right in line with the Romex. At the moment, this 100 ft roll is cheaper by about $20 than the 100 ft of Romex. I will say if you can bump up to the 250 ft roll, that is usually the best deal, but sometimes that is just overkill for your project and a smaller roll works out better.

It doesn't tangle/bulge internally and it coils sensibly. My wire gauge confirms it's 22awg. I plan to use this in my hobby of LED lighting controllers where this works well to send data, ground, and +VDC (5, 12, 24) to the strands from each transformer. I was pleased at the way this is packaged. Instead of being on a spool that explodes with released tension when uncoiled, this is on a larger plastic spool that's easy to \"tie off\" for reuse and very closely matches (coincidence?) the spools that LEDs come on, allowing them to live harmoniously in a box or standing on end in a file cabinet. The sheath strips nicely. The wires tin well. The cable doesn't sproing into a garage door spring at pressure when released from the package to use. It's a good price. If you need wire at the specifications listed, it's hard to go wrong here. While there are a number of variables involved, the required math is pretty straight-forward. 22G is about 43.4 ohms per km or 0.0434 ohms.per meter. Your project may not be running all channels at max brightness on all bulbs (RGB...and sometimes W) at the same time or it may be doing so for only a fraction of a second. Doing it for hours inside a packed conduit is different than an air-gapped conduit or being in the open. Just doing some quick math, let's imagine a 241 WS2812 project (like a Hexagon or a short strip) where each bulb is pulling .60ma per bulb (full intensity, white, and eye-torching white ON) That's a 14.5 W fixture at 24V, so you can use 22 gauge wire like this to drive 283feet and still lose only 1VDC at 24V. (It's worse at low voltages - this is why you want high voltages if wire length matters. It's the reason the power company lines to you are at 10's of thousands of volts....) If you're just doing boosters into taps, I'd imagine the distance to be even longer. 22Gauge is a good tradeoff of \"easy to work with\" and \"enough copper to deliver your electrons without resistance\" (hahahhaa. Ohm's Law jokes never get old.) I also did a spot test on painting it and it seems to take paint acceptably well. Some of this spool is probably going to end up in a permanent fixture that's tucked/painted into a corner of mine. This cable seems to be everything it claims to be and a nice set of specs for consumer lighting. Not fusable strands. Not chunky/expensive solid copper. Recommended.",
        "B01JM8J4TI <b>Great for low watt/amp projects</b> Easy to work with and once the wires are uncoiled, they don't tend recoil back on themselves like THNN wire does. I used these to rewire all of my traffic light LED modules. While 14 AWG is standard for this application; however, LEDs are a lower wattage and amp draw so 16 AWG works fine. Granted these wires are a lower grade than THNN, but it got the job done. I do recommend wire heat shrink if you are bundling many wires together. Keeps the \"rats nest\" manageable."

It is solid copper, and not plated like you'll get with lower priced wire. The price is at least 25% less than what you'll pay in a big box store. The connectors don't come with instructions although they are somewhat intuitive to install. Installation goes much easier if you attach the connector to the 14 gauge wire first by separating about 3\" of the two 14 gauge vconductors. Then unscrewing the larger size cap end of the connector. Underneath the cap you'll see a long metal pin. The pin will pierce the insulation of the wire when you screw the cap back on the connector. Once you have it attached to the 14 gauge wire unscrew the cap on the other end of the connector. This cap will have a small hole in which you insert the stripped end of whatever wire is coming from the light fixture you're trying to attach. Make sure you strip about a half an inch of insulation off that wire. I inserted this wire through the hole of the cap and then into the open end of the connector. They'll be a small metal rod sticking up and you want to press the wire in as far as it'll go and then screw the cap back on. If all went well the pressure of the cap will hold the wire inside the connector. I'm not sure about the weather resistance of the metal used inside this connector so I used some electrical corrosion prevention paste, which is a dark gray silicon based gel that is sold to help weatherproof outdoor electrical connections or when you're dealing with aluminum wiring. Hopefully the paste will make the connection more weather resistant. So far they've been out in the yard for a few months and I haven't had any issues.",

        "B07MCF1BMP <b>A very strange product. I would take 'outdoor rated' with a grain of salt</b> TL;DR version: If you intend to use this cable in an outdoor environment, I would look elsewhere. I have used several spools of this company's 3 conductor wire for various projects and it has worked out well. The conductors are not undersized, and the outer cable sheath is properly tough. So I decided to give their 2 conductor wire a try. It turned out to be a very oddly constructed 2 conductor cable. My biggest issue is that the outer protective layer is MUCH bigger than required. It is literally the same outer sheath size as the 3 conductor cable I have used often - it literally appears that they just pulled one conductor out of their 3 conductor cable, put it on a reel, and sold it. This is not great for a couple of reasons: 1) The cable is thicker than it needs to be (not space efficient), so anyone working with limited space for their wire runs, or wire runs that are visible (like low voltage outdoor LED lighting), may want to look elsewhere. 2) This stuff says it is outdoor rated. However it is outdoor rated for UV exposure only. Because there is so much empty space within the outer jacket, anyone wanting to use this outdoors in damp climates or around water (irrigation wiring, landscape lighting, etc) should realize that the outer jacket is going to rapidly fill up with water (and stay filled), causing several types of issues: - Electric issues: any minor wire scrapes or damage could result in hard-to-trace shorts or random voltage drops. - Extra water weight: The extra weight all of that water filling up the PVC jacket could be significant. I intended to use this cable for outdoor permanent installations of LED light strings, hung or mounted in various ways on my house and in landscaping. I live in a wet climate, and after a few months of rainy fall/winter/spring weather I estimate that the added weight of all that water filling up the empty space within the cable jacket would more than double the total weight of the cable runs. With a couple hundred feet of cable, that weight will add up pretty quickly. - Water damage: Depending on how/where your cabling is routed, you could essentially be installing a de-facto water pipe that will shunt rain and/or irrigation water through the excess space within the outer jacket and into areas of your walls/house that would otherwise have remained perfectly dry. A potential recipe for serious hidden water damage. I ended up returning this and buying a different product elsewhere."

        "B0CSD35PQT <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone.",

        "B0CH2R3XNH <b>Copper Clad * ALUMINUM * for maybe 10 amps</b> This product sort of tricked me. I saw 12/2 wire and I’m just so used to everything being copper that I didn’t notice this listing is for CCA (Copper Clad Aluminum). That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but if - like me - you see 12 AWG and have a knee jerk expectation this can carry twenty amps then you’re going to be disappointed. That said, you don’t normally need that kind of amperage in a low voltage system anyway. What tipped me off was measuring the resistance. When I join the two ends of this roll to get a 240-ft loop, I measure 1.0 ohms (after subtracting out 0.1 for my test leads). That’s about double what I’d expect from 12 AWG copper, and puts it more in the neighborhood of 16 AWG copper. So we’re looking at wire here that can carry something in the neighborhood of ten amps — assuming you have enough voltage to even make that happen. This is a consideration that I don’t see mentioned in the product listing at the time of this writing. And that’s probably fine for most garden lighting projects (up to maybe 100W, hopefully not all going down one wire). LED lights these days really don’t use a whole lot of power. So if this product meets your needs then by all means go for it. I see nothing to complain about in terms of build quality and fully expect it to survive direct burial operation. I just want to make sure you’re not under-sizing your wire. And, just to be clear, this wire is for low voltage applications. If you’re looking to carry line voltage without running conduit then you probably want UF-B wire instead and there are rules about how deep you have to bury it (usually one foot at the very least — and that’s assuming you have ground fault protection).",

You should be good for 180 watts worth of lights on a 12 volt system (360 on a 24 volt system) with this gauge stranded copper wire. At 3-5 watts each per LED garden light, that's a lot of LEDs! This insulation is a little tough. This makes installation difficult and may not be compatible with substandard or old, used, oxidized landscape wire taps.

The PVC insulation is tough and will stand up to abrasion. This cable should not be used for line voltage applications as the insulation is not rated for that application. I use 14/2 cable in my landscape lighting for the final connections to groups of LED fixtures. I use 12/2 for distribution over long distances to get to the clusters of fixtures. 14/2 works great in that application and helps to save a little money compared to running 12/2 everywhere. If your cable runs are all short and you have a modest number of LED fixtures then 14/2 may be good enough for the entire system. Note that 14/2 cable has a lower current rating than 12/2 cable, which is counterintuitive given the numbers are getting smaller as ampacity increases. So if you've got really long cable runs you'll probably want to use the 12/2 instead."

Wire for rear tractor lighting needs to be run along the underside where brush, sticks, briars claw away at it constantly. More than once, I have had wiring damaged or destroyed. I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications. I really like this wire, and I look forward to using it to upgrade my tractor warning lights in preparation for spring. It would be equally suitable for use on a mowers or trailers as well. I think this product will provide adequate protection for wiring in a tough environment for a long time. In fact, with good end connections, I am hopeful that it will last as long as the equipment."

        "B0CL75YXB3 <b>Quality wire in a durable jacket</b> I acquired this cable to wire some repair some existing lights and add supplemental warning lights on my tractor. Wire for rear tractor lighting needs to be run along the underside where brush, sticks, briars claw away at it constantly. More than once, I have had wiring damaged or destroyed. I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications. I really like this wire, and I look forward to using it to upgrade my tractor warning lights in preparation for spring. It would be equally suitable for use on a mowers or trailers as well. I think this product will provide adequate protection for wiring in a tough environment for a long time. In fact, with good end connections, I am hopeful that it will last as long as the equipment."

After I screwed each one on, though, I picked up some dirt and rubbed it in to my hands; that worked fine to remove the stickiness, and washed off later with no problem. I kind of think that I could have saved some money by using regular wire nuts and just squirting silicone caulk in it before screwing in the wire, but I'm not positive it would have been the same.

        "B0C5FC1KJZ <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again)."

        "B07MCF1BMP <b>A very strange product. I would take 'outdoor rated' with a grain of salt</b> TL;DR version: If you intend to use this cable in an outdoor environment, I would look elsewhere. I have used several spools of this company's 3 conductor wire for various projects and it has worked out well. The conductors are not undersized, and the outer cable sheath is properly tough. So I decided to give their 2 conductor wire a try. It turned out to be a very oddly constructed 2 conductor cable. My biggest issue is that the outer protective layer is MUCH bigger than required. It is literally the same outer sheath size as the 3 conductor cable I have used often - it literally appears that they just pulled one conductor out of their 3 conductor cable, put it on a reel, and sold it. This is not great for a couple of reasons: 1) The cable is thicker than it needs to be (not space efficient), so anyone working with limited space for their wire runs, or wire runs that are visible (like low voltage outdoor LED lighting), may want to look elsewhere. 2) This stuff says it is outdoor rated. However it is outdoor rated for UV exposure only. Because there is so much empty space within the outer jacket, anyone wanting to use this outdoors in damp climates or around water (irrigation wiring, landscape lighting, etc) should realize that the outer jacket is going to rapidly fill up with water (and stay filled), causing several types of issues: - Electric issues: any minor wire scrapes or damage could result in hard-to-trace shorts or random voltage drops. - Extra water weight: The extra weight all of that water filling up the PVC jacket could be significant. I intended to use this cable for outdoor permanent installations of LED light strings, hung or mounted in various ways on my house and in landscaping. I live in a wet climate, and after a few months of rainy fall/winter/spring weather I estimate that the added weight of all that water filling up the empty space within the cable jacket would more than double the total weight of the cable runs. With a couple hundred feet of cable, that weight will add up pretty quickly. - Water damage: Depending on how/where your cabling is routed, you could essentially be installing a de-facto water pipe that will shunt rain and/or irrigation water through the excess space within the outer jacket and into areas of your walls/house that would otherwise have remained perfectly dry. A potential recipe for serious hidden water damage. I ended up returning this and buying a different product elsewhere."

I installed both the plug and socket slide on connectors without any difficulty. I did use a large pair of pliers to fully seat the cover of each connector. Tip: One side of the wire has a raised ridge. I aligned this side with the wider polarized plug/socket on the slide on connectors to ensure polarity was maintained at each connector. This is an important electrical safety feature that should be followed. Recently an ice storm interrupted power at my house for two days. My portable generator was able to provide electricity for only some parts of the house. The Wi-Fi router what is across the house and the outlets serving it did not have power. I used this extension cord at it’s full 50 foot length to run electricity from an energized outlet to my Wi-Fi router.

The fine strands (150 of them, but I didn't count!) can be a bit of a challenge when crimping contacts... make sure no microscopic strands escape the crimp -- then it works great. The insulation is thick but soft: very easy to work with but also easily damaged if used in the wrong application. It's the right cable for routing in tight locations, since it's so willing to bend and lay flat... good for DIY drones (flexing arms or retracting legs) or making wiring harnesses that need to flex but are well protected from abrasion and pinching. For more rugged high-temp insulation, consider PTFE but it is much more difficult to work with and hard to find at a reasonable price. As noted by others, some colors are a bit off. Red is clearly orange, and blue is gray-purple. That's okay for my purposes, but maybe not if you are building to a print for assemblies that will be inspected.

It also cuts extremely easily, meaning no scoring multiple times trying to get to the wire inside. The insulation on the wires seems like standard insulation, not the gel-type thick insulation found on other brands of speaker wire. If you do a lot of wiring, this is key as a standard wire stripper works great with it - a real time saver.

I recently tried the UBOORY 16/2 Low Voltage Landscape Wire and I must say this is a great product. This 16-gauge, 2-conductor wire is perfect for outdoor direct burial electrical wiring needs, and it is built to last. The copper wire construction is durable and resistant to wear and tear, ensuring that it can withstand the elements and provide reliable performance for years to come. I appreciate the most about this wire is how easy it is to work with. It is flexible and easy to bend, making it easy to route around landscaping features and other obstacles. It is also color-coded for easy identification and installation, which made the process of setting up my outdoor lighting system a breeze. The 50-foot length is more than enough for most outdoor projects, and the low voltage rating ensures that it is safe to use around plants and other outdoor features. This wire is ideal for use with low voltage LED lighting systems, which are becoming increasingly popular for their energy efficiency and ease of use. This cable works great with waterproof connectors, or waterproof wire nuts. Overall, I highly recommend the UBOORY 16/2 Low Voltage Landscape Wire to anyone who is in need of a reliable and high-quality wire for their outdoor electrical needs. It is easy to work with, durable, and provides excellent performance. It has definitely been a great addition to my outdoor lighting system, and I'm sure it will be for you too!",

        "B0CSD3GJ53 <b>Great wire, but not compatible with some crimp connectors</b> I installed our landscape lighting almost 2 decades ago. Some bulbs have gone out due to failing electrical connectors. I tried replacing the connectors, but the insulation on the existing wire has become so hard that the prongs on the connectors just don’t penetrate correctly anymore. I ordered this to replace that hardened landscape wire. Unfortunately, the Quic Disc connectors I used previously do not work with this wire. Its insulation is slightly thinner than the original wire, and the conductors are spaced closer together. The Quic Disc prongs don’t align properly with the new conductors. If one prong hits the center of one conductor, the other prong can miss the other conductor entirely. The lights are only a few feet apart in a long flower bed, and I didn’t want to cut this wire into many short segments to use wire nuts at each light. So I tried the new Malibu Low Voltage Cable Connectors that pierce the insulation from both sides. They work perfectly, and have the advantage that the wire doesn’t have to be split apart every few feet to use an alternate piercing connector. Bottom line, this is great wire, with real copper conductors and flexible insulation that is easy to work with. It just isn't compatible with crimp connectors that expect the conductors to have the same spacing as in old 12 gauge landscape wire.",

Not the silicone variety, not stranded. Have measured the tinned core diameter to be 28 AWG. Clear lettering on the PVC insulation says 300V. So, it is basically as advertised ... but still, not exactly what I wanted. For bodging and wrapping electronic projects, it is better to have thinner insulation ... the jacket on this wire is exceptionally thick for the gauge. It is impossible to fish this through PCB journals without drilling them out. Still, it will be useful, as wraps nicely around posts, and seems a good value. Am left a little puzzled though, what the industrial application is for a thin wire like this, with such thick insulation."

The individual strands are also thin making it easy to connect to the lights. Nothing worse than thick strands that are difficult to work with and stab you in the finger as you try to wrap together.

        "B0CSD35PQT <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone.",

In the videos the wire coating smoldered but the wire connector did not burn. I found these to be easy to use and easy to verify I had a good connection. And I had enough room to put the wires back into the traditional electricians coil with ground, neutral, hot, and traveler ordering as well as the much deeper insulated smart plug case. Remember that whereas a wire nut can be removed and retightened when using stranded wire, these connectors much be removed and replaced for stranded wire. If one is using solid wire, then the connect can safely be removed and reused. So plan well when connecting them. Use the traditional electricians coiling techniques (same technique they use to prepare the wires during the rough in, prior to the drywall work).",

        "B07MCF1BMP <b>A very strange product. I would take 'outdoor rated' with a grain of salt</b> TL;DR version: If you intend to use this cable in an outdoor environment, I would look elsewhere. I have used several spools of this company's 3 conductor wire for various projects and it has worked out well. The conductors are not undersized, and the outer cable sheath is properly tough. So I decided to give their 2 conductor wire a try. It turned out to be a very oddly constructed 2 conductor cable. My biggest issue is that the outer protective layer is MUCH bigger than required. It is literally the same outer sheath size as the 3 conductor cable I have used often - it literally appears that they just pulled one conductor out of their 3 conductor cable, put it on a reel, and sold it. This is not great for a couple of reasons: 1) The cable is thicker than it needs to be (not space efficient), so anyone working with limited space for their wire runs, or wire runs that are visible (like low voltage outdoor LED lighting), may want to look elsewhere. 2) This stuff says it is outdoor rated. However it is outdoor rated for UV exposure only. Because there is so much empty space within the outer jacket, anyone wanting to use this outdoors in damp climates or around water (irrigation wiring, landscape lighting, etc) should realize that the outer jacket is going to rapidly fill up with water (and stay filled), causing several types of issues: - Electric issues: any minor wire scrapes or damage could result in hard-to-trace shorts or random voltage drops. - Extra water weight: The extra weight all of that water filling up the PVC jacket could be significant. I intended to use this cable for outdoor permanent installations of LED light strings, hung or mounted in various ways on my house and in landscaping. I live in a wet climate, and after a few months of rainy fall/winter/spring weather I estimate that the added weight of all that water filling up the empty space within the cable jacket would more than double the total weight of the cable runs. With a couple hundred feet of cable, that weight will add up pretty quickly. - Water damage: Depending on how/where your cabling is routed, you could essentially be installing a de-facto water pipe that will shunt rain and/or irrigation water through the excess space within the outer jacket and into areas of your walls/house that would otherwise have remained perfectly dry. A potential recipe for serious hidden water damage. I ended up returning this and buying a different product elsewhere.",
        "B07MCF1BMP <b>Good quality wire, but excessively thick outer casing</b> The wire itself is good quality, no complaints there, but the outer jacket is very loose around the wires (which might be what some are looking for), but this does cause the overall thickness to be rather exessive for a 2-conductor 18 AWG cable."

        "B07GH7JHG9 <b>Beware of Copper Clad Aluminum Wire!</b> When shopping for Cat5e or Cat6 network cables, make sure you are comparing apples to apples. One of the most common tactics of the “low cost leaders” is to use aluminum instead of copper wire. This can lead to network issues from using inferior materials to transmit the signal. Looking to cut costs, manufacturers started using aluminum wire dipped in a thin coating of copper. This technique created an aluminum core cable surrounded by a thin layer of copper. The performance and safety of CCA cables are radically different. In fact, aluminum network cables violate TIA and IEC standards for Cat5e and Cat6 cables. CCA cable has higher attenuation than pure copper cables. This results in a greater loss of data, as packets have to be re-transmitted. The more data that is re-transmitted, the slower your network performs. Plus, these problems are compounded by every foot of cable you use; the longer the cable, the worse the performance. CCA cables also have a 55% higher DC resistance. This increases the amount of energy that is transferred into heat and reduces the amount of power that can be transferred. This issue makes them unusable for power over Ethernet (PoE) devices like IP cameras and phones. These cut corners also affect installers because aluminum wire creates installation issues. Due to the lower tensile strength, aluminum cables can be damaged when being pulled. Single conductors can break, making the cable useless, or the whole cable can snap. Aluminum also has a lower bend radius than pure copper cables. This means you can’t bend it as much before it fails. In short, spend the extra money on solid core copper cable."

        "B0CH2R3XNH <b>Copper Clad * ALUMINUM * for maybe 10 amps</b> This product sort of tricked me. I saw 12/2 wire and I’m just so used to everything being copper that I didn’t notice this listing is for CCA (Copper Clad Aluminum). That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but if - like me - you see 12 AWG and have a knee jerk expectation this can carry twenty amps then you’re going to be disappointed. That said, you don’t normally need that kind of amperage in a low voltage system anyway. What tipped me off was measuring the resistance. When I join the two ends of this roll to get a 240-ft loop, I measure 1.0 ohms (after subtracting out 0.1 for my test leads). That’s about double what I’d expect from 12 AWG copper, and puts it more in the neighborhood of 16 AWG copper. So we’re looking at wire here that can carry something in the neighborhood of ten amps — assuming you have enough voltage to even make that happen. This is a consideration that I don’t see mentioned in the product listing at the time of this writing. And that’s probably fine for most garden lighting projects (up to maybe 100W, hopefully not all going down one wire). LED lights these days really don’t use a whole lot of power. So if this product meets your needs then by all means go for it. I see nothing to complain about in terms of build quality and fully expect it to survive direct burial operation. I just want to make sure you’re not under-sizing your wire. And, just to be clear, this wire is for low voltage applications. If you’re looking to carry line voltage without running conduit then you probably want UF-B wire instead and there are rules about how deep you have to bury it (usually one foot at the very least — and that’s assuming you have ground fault protection)."

In one case, I ordered a 50' spool of 18 gauge wire that turned out to be a good 20% smaller, giving 20% higher resistance. So -- the first thing I wanted to check on this wire was the resistance of a single conductor through the length of the whole spool. Granted, I haven't unwound it to measure its length, so I'm taking that part at face value. The principle here is that any copper wire of a certain cross-sectional area (i.e. gauge) will have a given resistance per foot. There are many free online wire resistance calculators that will tell you just what the total resistance should be, when you provide it with the length and wire gauge. In this case, 50' of 16ga wire should be 0.201 ohms. As you can see in the photo, that's exactly what I have, within the precision of the meter I was using. It was actually flipping occasionally between 0.19 - 0.21 but typically sat on 0.20 ohms, which is pretty firm confirmation that this is, in fact, 16ga wire. Having confirmed that fact, I'm happy to recommend this cable for all intended purposes. The individual wires are easy to strip, have thick insulation, and the black outer sheath is sturdy and slick. Within each 16ga wire, the individual strands are pre-tinned, which gives much better corrosion resistance for when you're working in a wet, or otherwise corrosive, environment (like on a boat's wiring or other marine environment).

Right in the ballpark of .14 ohms for 23 feet that I calculate I should have. Sorry I didn't have enough hands to measure the wire and get a picture too.

It pulled about 900ma which means for that length of wire (eye-balled not measured) resistance is about 13 ohms. It glowed bright red. Note that wire increases in resistance as it is heated so this measurement will be higher than with an ohmmeter. I wrapped it around a pair of needle-nose pliers and pulled until it gave way. It required a few pounds of tension. Easily strong enough to use to cut Styrofoam, my opinion. I don't think copper will like the heat of a direct connection. For cutting Styrofoam, I think I would wrap it around a small length of steel wire and then push it through a steel butt connector and clamp it tight. Then attach the copper wire to the steel wire.",

The roll didn't come with the inner end sticking out so I unrolled it all, drilled a larger hole so it would fit, then re-wrappped (poorly). The inner end could be connected to a power source to allow re-using the roll for temporary tasks needing power at a distance. I measured 3.4mm dia. insulation, 1.4mm dia. wire. Resistance over the whole roll (100 ft. x both directions) was 0.864 ohms, which works out to 4.32 ohms per 1000 ft (verified with LCR meter and running 2A current through it).

        "B0C5FC1KJZ <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again)."

And I love how they included heat shrink to protect your crimp points. This is for low voltage applications, as indicated in the product title. I realize that (at least at the time of this writing) the product description claims it can handle up to 600V, but I’m fairly certain it’s not UL listed for that to comply with electrical code. If you want to run full line voltage outdoors without conduit then you should be looking for UF-B wire and there are rules about how deep you have to bury it (usually one foot at the very least — and that’s assuming you have ground fault protection). This product is either for low voltage landscape lighting (12-24V) or telecommunications. You don’t normally need four conductors for lighting, but I’ll leave that to you to figure out. Maybe you’re trying something fancy."

You'll need to use a very sharp knife and very CAREFULLY cut down the middle. I added a piece of heat shrink tube to also stop it from further splitting. Recommendations: When it comes to cables, here are some considerations: 1) the thicker the wire (lower AWG number), the lower resistance, and more efficient; 2) the downside to thicker cables, is it's heavier, and sometimes less flexible; 3) higher voltage will lead to insulation breakdown (these are rated for 600 VDC).

        "B09V56LTY5 <b>Good for repairing outdoor marker light cables, robust insulation, pure copper wire - not tinned</b> We have an extensive series of outdoor stairs and boardwalks that are lighted by LED marker lights every ten feet. The lights are powered by a low voltage cable under the walkways. Last Winter a mother fox made a temporary den for her cubs under one of the boardwalks. In the Spring we discovered that several of the marker lights wouldn't light up due to power cables that were chewed through by sharp little teeth. The foxes have moved on but we were faced with repairing the broken cable. That's why I got this cable. It's perfect for low voltage outdoor use. The outside jacket is thick and robust. It took a bit of careful cutting to strip it off without damaging the inside conductor wires. Once off, I noticed this isn't just a standard single channel insulator jacket. It actually has two channels -- one for each of the conductors. (See photo.) That's makes for very tightly insulated conductors that should provide enhanced protection in underground or very wet environments. When I stripped the two conductors, I noticed they are not tinned as stated in the product description. This may or may not be an issue for you. Tinned copper cable is easier to solder and also minimizes corrosion for non-soldered joints. I removed a star from an otherwise five star review due to this. Summary Comments If you don't need tinned copper cable for low voltage outdoor applications, this is a good choice. The insulation is robust and should hold up well in underground or wet environments. You get pure copper conductors that provide efficient electrical conductivity."

        "B01K4RPB3O <b>Good quality, high strand-count high flexibility tinned wire with silicone rubber insulation</b> This 22 AWG (gauge) silicone insulated wire is excellent for indoor or protected environments where high flexibility/lack of stiffness, and non-melting (or at least melt resistant) insulation is required. The conductors are a 'high strand count\" type, meaning that instead of being comprised of just a few larger/thicker strands, it is instead comprised of a much greater number of smaller/thinner strands; and this contributes to its lack of stiffness/great flexibility. The other contributing factor to the high flexibility is that the insulation is silicone rubber, rather than the more common PVC (which is rather stiff). This kind of high strand count, silicone rubber insulated wire is exactly what high quality test equipment 'test leads' have been made of for decades. The silicone rubber is also much less heat sensitive than more common insulations such as PVC or \"machine tool wire\". It won't melt off as readily as PVC insulation does if your soldering iron needs to be held onto a joint or terminal for an extended period of time. The fine wire strands are also nicely tinned, and the insulation strips off easily and cleanly, and the stranded wire solders easily. It is a good quality product at an affordable price. HOWEVER, it is not the best choice for many common \"hook up wire\" applications, since its lack of stiffness can be an issue; the strands definitely need to be twisted and soldered in order to keep their shape enough to be formed into a hook before soldering around a terminal for example. This wire also does not want to cooperate if you want to twist a few of them together, because their limpness makes them uncooperative in that regard. And if you use this wire in \"hook up wire\" applications, it wants to just flop into some odd position rather than 'staying put' where you want it to be. Silicone rubber insulation is also not that great when it comes to abrasion resistance, and resistance to some kinds of oils and such where other insulations may be preferable."

Wire for rear tractor lighting needs to be run along the underside where brush, sticks, briars claw away at it constantly. More than once, I have had wiring damaged or destroyed. I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications. I really like this wire, and I look forward to using it to upgrade my tractor warning lights in preparation for spring. It would be equally suitable for use on a mowers or trailers as well. I think this product will provide adequate protection for wiring in a tough environment for a long time. In fact, with good end connections, I am hopeful that it will last as long as the equipment."

Since some of those may involve something on my boat, having tinned conductors is a real plus -- it does help prevent corrosion of the copper, and you can see the tinned strands in one of my included photos. My one issue with this product is the claim that the conductors are 18 gauge. Granted, I don't plan to use this anywhere that I'll be pushing the limits of an 18ga wire, but I did want at least to test the claims. I don't have a great way of measuring the diameter of the wire, especially with twisted strands. This is technically what the wire gauge means. However, a wire's resistance is a function of its cross-sectional area, and there are numerous free online calculators to let you determine what the resistance of a certain gauge of wire should be for a given length of wire. Here's what you do: Search for wire resistance calculator Enter 18 gauge and 50 ft You get 0.319 ohms Measure the resistance of one conductor for the entire 50' spool Compare your resistance reading to what it should be As shown, I used the red conductor (they should all be the same) and I got between 0.38 and 0.40 ohms. Since the resistance is higher than it should be for 18 gauge, I can know with reasonable certainty that the wire is smaller than 18 gauge. In fact, a 19 gauge wire (uncommon in the US) should be right at 0.403 ohms for 50' of wire. This all may not sound like much, but the resistance is over 22% higher than it should be for 18ga, which means that you're getting 22% less copper than you're expecting. All that's to say that this product seems fine, and as long as you're not depending on the full conductivity of a true 18 gauge wire, you'll be good. However, I tend to score products pretty harshly when they make claims that they can't hold up to, and sadly that's the case with this cable. Buy it and use it, eyes wide open, or buy something else if you need a true 18 gauge wire."

The conductors are fine stranded, tinned copper, which is a thin protective coating on the copper to keep it from corroding in harsh environments such as ocean areas, or auto applications where winter road salting can cause problems. Despite what other reviewers have said, this is indeed copper wire, but the “tinning” process makes the wire appear silver unless you look at the cut end. It is typically used with crimp connectors in most applications. There is no indication that this wire is UL listed, so I would not use it for home-wiring applications or any 120 volt (or higher) AC current. The silicone insulation and fine stranding make this wire very flexible, so perfect for sharp turns and pulling through tight locations like behind the dash. The 14 gauge that I used is good for any circuits of up to 10 amps unless they are longer than 25 feet or so. Remember to calculate for both positive and negative lengths, and whether you can afford any voltage drop in your circuit. Circuits for an automotive refrigerator or fog lamps, which have extended use times for example, are different than a circuit for a horn, which is only used for a couple seconds at a time.

In one case, I ordered a 50' spool of 18 gauge wire that turned out to be a good 20% smaller, giving 20% higher resistance. So -- the first thing I wanted to check on this wire was the resistance of a single conductor through the length of the whole spool. Granted, I haven't unwound it to measure its length, so I'm taking that part at face value. The principle here is that any copper wire of a certain cross-sectional area (i.e. gauge) will have a given resistance per foot. There are many free online wire resistance calculators that will tell you just what the total resistance should be, when you provide it with the length and wire gauge. In this case, 50' of 16ga wire should be 0.201 ohms. As you can see in the photo, that's exactly what I have, within the precision of the meter I was using. It was actually flipping occasionally between 0.19 - 0.21 but typically sat on 0.20 ohms, which is pretty firm confirmation that this is, in fact, 16ga wire. Having confirmed that fact, I'm happy to recommend this cable for all intended purposes. The individual wires are easy to strip, have thick insulation, and the black outer sheath is sturdy and slick. Within each 16ga wire, the individual strands are pre-tinned, which gives much better corrosion resistance for when you're working in a wet, or otherwise corrosive, environment (like on a boat's wiring or other marine environment).

Needed wire to run through the attic from the LED strips to a controller about 22 feet away. Wanted something heavier than the 22 gauge wire you find everywhere, and I wanted 100 foot spool Those two combinations limited what was out there. Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white).

The prices for these spools are cheaper than similar PVC coated wires at Walmart for 20 gauge wire and these have more expensive silicone coating and tinned copper. Price wise these are very good wires and good for small projects or repairs on electronics. The wire is very flexible and good for replacing cheaper wires in outdoor equipment that are subject to the elements or chemicals. The silicone is good for almost degrees 400F which is great for power and heating equipment as they are more chemical resistant and won't melt as easily. I have two outdoor portable water heaters used for camping and the wiring on the units use the cheaper PVC and the insulation can melt when the heaters are used for extended periods.

The conductors are a 'high strand count\" type, meaning that instead of being comprised of just a few larger/thicker strands, it is instead comprised of a much greater number of smaller/thinner strands; and this contributes to its lack of stiffness/great flexibility. The other contributing factor to the high flexibility is that the insulation is silicone rubber, rather than the more common PVC (which is rather stiff). This kind of high strand count, silicone rubber insulated wire is exactly what high quality test equipment 'test leads' have been made of for decades. The silicone rubber is also much less heat sensitive than more common insulations such as PVC or \"machine tool wire\". It won't melt off as readily as PVC insulation does if your soldering iron needs to be held onto a joint or terminal for an extended period of time. The fine wire strands are also nicely tinned, and the insulation strips off easily and cleanly, and the stranded wire solders easily. It is a good quality product at an affordable price. HOWEVER, it is not the best choice for many common \"hook up wire\" applications, since its lack of stiffness can be an issue; the strands definitely need to be twisted and soldered in order to keep their shape enough to be formed into a hook before soldering around a terminal for example. This wire also does not want to cooperate if you want to twist a few of them together, because their limpness makes them uncooperative in that regard. And if you use this wire in \"hook up wire\" applications, it wants to just flop into some odd position rather than 'staying put' where you want it to be. Silicone rubber insulation is also not that great when it comes to abrasion resistance, and resistance to some kinds of oils and such where other insulations may be preferable."

But keep in mind, to use T connectors with the thickness, you'll have to use outdoor grade connectors as well. I initially bought (normal) 12v T connectors but the wire was too thick, so i had to buy outdoor grade t-connectors. Not a problem, but something to keep in mind. Great products and would highly recommend for not just outdoor projects!"

What a deal... just perfect to both use and store, sits flat and doesn't take up much room and stacks well. Great start... The outside insulation jacket is a very thick PVC material, it wasn't real easy to cut so it shouldn't nick easily (think of a errant nick from using a wire staple). Even though it's a thick jacket, it's super pliable. The inside wire insulation both cuts and strips more easily than the outside and is easy to work with. I only hesitate saying a joy, because it sounds to corny... There's about a million different uses and projects that this wire would be perfect for, you'll certainly run out of wire before you run out of projects. It is NOT house wiring or electrical supply to anything... it's very small, 22 gauge is tiny.. In a house, it would be doorbell or maybe 'ring' style wiring (or alarm sensors), garage door buttons & sensors, not for lights or outlets, extension cords, etc..

I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications.

I have used several spools of this company's 3 conductor wire for various projects and it has worked out well. The conductors are not undersized, and the outer cable sheath is properly tough. So I decided to give their 2 conductor wire a try. It turned out to be a very oddly constructed 2 conductor cable. My biggest issue is that the outer protective layer is MUCH bigger than required. It is literally the same outer sheath size as the 3 conductor cable I have used often - it literally appears that they just pulled one conductor out of their 3 conductor cable, put it on a reel, and sold it. This is not great for a couple of reasons: 1) The cable is thicker than it needs to be (not space efficient), so anyone working with limited space for their wire runs, or wire runs that are visible (like low voltage outdoor LED lighting), may want to look elsewhere. 2) This stuff says it is outdoor rated. However it is outdoor rated for UV exposure only. Because there is so much empty space within the outer jacket, anyone wanting to use this outdoors in damp climates or around water (irrigation wiring, landscape lighting, etc) should realize that the outer jacket is going to rapidly fill up with water (and stay filled), causing several types of issues: - Electric issues: any minor wire scrapes or damage could result in hard-to-trace shorts or random voltage drops. - Extra water weight: The extra weight all of that water filling up the PVC jacket could be significant. I intended to use this cable for outdoor permanent installations of LED light strings, hung or mounted in various ways on my house and in landscaping. I live in a wet climate, and after a few months of rainy fall/winter/spring weather I estimate that the added weight of all that water filling up the empty space within the cable jacket would more than double the total weight of the cable runs. With a couple hundred feet of cable, that weight will add up pretty quickly. - Water damage: Depending on how/where your cabling is routed, you could essentially be installing a de-facto water pipe that will shunt rain and/or irrigation water through the excess space within the outer jacket and into areas of your walls/house that would otherwise have remained perfectly dry. A potential recipe for serious hidden water damage. I ended up returning this and buying a different product elsewhere.",

It's easy to strip and cut to any length needed, making it versatile for different applications. The wire is conveniently wrapped around a hard plastic spool for easy dispensing. It features two jacket colors, red and black, to quickly and easily distinguish polarity, and numbered markings for accuracy. The flexible jacket material allows for easy twisting and extending as needed. Each conductor is color-coded and enclosed within the white CL2 outer jacket, ensuring safety for use within residential class building walls. I've personally used this wire to replace my car's speaker wiring, and I'm pleased with its performance. The copper-clad aluminum core maintains good audio quality, making it an excellent choice for speaker wiring. It's relatively soft and easy to work with, and the durable outer jacket ensures long-lasting use."

It's SOOW which means it's an oil and weather resistant service cord for heavy-duty use. Unfortunately, I discovered that I can buy it at the local big-box store for 15-20% less by the foot, where you can get just the length you need and not have to go for a full reel and potentially have waste left over, increasing the price further. In bulk, the price goes down, making this even less of a bargain. So check the price. If they drop it to a reasonable value, then this is decent wire, but currently it's overpriced, at least compared to what I can buy locally."

        "B09V56LTY5 <b>Good for repairing outdoor marker light cables, robust insulation, pure copper wire - not tinned</b> We have an extensive series of outdoor stairs and boardwalks that are lighted by LED marker lights every ten feet. The lights are powered by a low voltage cable under the walkways. Last Winter a mother fox made a temporary den for her cubs under one of the boardwalks. In the Spring we discovered that several of the marker lights wouldn't light up due to power cables that were chewed through by sharp little teeth. The foxes have moved on but we were faced with repairing the broken cable. That's why I got this cable. It's perfect for low voltage outdoor use. The outside jacket is thick and robust. It took a bit of careful cutting to strip it off without damaging the inside conductor wires. Once off, I noticed this isn't just a standard single channel insulator jacket. It actually has two channels -- one for each of the conductors. (See photo.) That's makes for very tightly insulated conductors that should provide enhanced protection in underground or very wet environments. When I stripped the two conductors, I noticed they are not tinned as stated in the product description. This may or may not be an issue for you. Tinned copper cable is easier to solder and also minimizes corrosion for non-soldered joints. I removed a star from an otherwise five star review due to this. Summary Comments If you don't need tinned copper cable for low voltage outdoor applications, this is a good choice. The insulation is robust and should hold up well in underground or wet environments. You get pure copper conductors that provide efficient electrical conductivity."

So, it is basically as advertised ... but still, not exactly what I wanted. For bodging and wrapping electronic projects, it is better to have thinner insulation ... the jacket on this wire is exceptionally thick for the gauge.

The use of tinned copper wire is a significant advantage of this silicone wire. The tin layer serves as a protective barrier for the inner oxygen-free copper, preventing it from being oxidized. This feature enhances the wire's longevity and ensures consistent performance over time, even in demanding conditions. The soft silicone insulator on this wire makes it highly flexible, making it easy to handle and maneuver during installations. This flexibility is a real benefit when working in tight spaces or intricate electrical setups, as it allows for smooth routing and minimizes the risk of wire kinking or damage. The availability of six different colors in the spools is a practical and thoughtful feature. It makes it easy to distinguish between wires and simplifies identification in complex wiring configurations. This color-coding system has been invaluable in my projects, enabling me to work more efficiently and avoid any potential wiring errors. With its rating for all under 600V devices and a rated current of 12A, this silicone wire is suitable for a wide range of applications.

The 50' piece of YELLOW wiring was long enough to go in the hole in the wall I made, down through the wall to the basement and over to the breaker box. It's like an electron super highway!!! It was about $20 cheaper than Lowe's or Home Depot, which is awesome. Plus, it's YELLOW!!!!!!!!!!!",
        "B0CL75YXB3 <b>Great for trailer lights!</b> I upgraded my trailer lights from a 4-wire system to a 5-wire system. This 5-wire is cased in a black sleeve casing that is durable and fits perfectly into a 1/2\" seal tight fitting. I would have given it a 5 star if the wires casing was molded around the inner wires but it is just a casing that is slid over the wires. With that said, I still think that this will be a robust solution and will last many years. The kit also comes with shrink tubes for the wire connections.

        "B08PKLKTR4 <b>Works well, but installation was a pain.</b> The product did the job, and it is a good solution for getting a difficult to access thermostat run with 4+ wires up to the 5+ required to correctly run something like a nest with basic heating and cooling. If you have any less in the wall, it's probably just not worth it for a standard HVAC system. Even with 4 wires and two of these kits, you can only get to 6 wire equivalent, which doesn't run quite everything you would find in a typical house (pick only one of 2 stage heat, 2 stage cooling, and humidifier). If it's even moderately accessible, just buy yourself a nice flex drill and pull in a new 7/8 wire thermostat bundle. Installation was a hassle on my furnace, though. First, the included wires are really short, to the point that I had to extend them just to reach a surface for mounting. Secondly, the extra wires would not fit on the terminal screws along with with the original wires, so I had to crimp spade connectors to each pair. Third, the expectation is to use a wire nut to connect the diode to the blue wire. A bunch of thermostats, mine included, use solid/stiff wire and small holes in the wall. The wire nut did not hold well under that stress, so you may need to either make a larger hole in the wall, or replace the joint with something more sturdy, like a tight mechanical twist and solder. Expect to make minor adjustments to get things working. This type of product isn't suitable for someone without a selection of basic electrical tools (drill, fasteners, shrink wrap, strippers, cutters, crimpers, spare wire, terminal connectors, etc.) and comfort working with them, but I would recommend it otherwise.",

        "B0C5MGQNKS <b>Used as Speaker wire</b> I am using this as speaker wire for my \"Presence\" speakers in my 7.1 surround sound system. It was easy to open the outer jacket and separate the individual wires. I just used a utility knife. I did not have to apply much pressure, therefore making it easier to avoid cutting the insulation on the individual cables. I have an old wire stripper from the early seventies that came from Radio Shack. I just put the cables in and squeeze and get perfectly stripped ends. I have used these strippers on some cables that this is not so easily done. Attached are pictures of the strippers and pictures of the wire at various stages. In one of them you can see where I stripped the middle of the cable insulation. I kept all 4 wires, 2 for each channel in the main jacket until I got to the top of my cabinet where I mounted the speakers. Then I pulled out two wires for one channel. From there I continued to pull the complete jacket with the other two wire to the other speaker. I connected banana plugs to the ends that go into my receiver. Basically, just strip, push the cable through and then screw the tips on. These are Amazon Basics Speaker Connector Banana Plugs,12 Count (1 Pack of 6 Pairs), 0.54 x 0.54 x 1.62 inches. I have used these many times on installations. This wire was easy to use with these plugs. The wire work fine. Sound is great. Installation was easy. What can I say? It is wire; the way it should be.

Giant bright blue and red wire nuts really stand out in an undesirable way in a landscape bed. Secondly, it is hard to shop for these, colors seems to correspond to size but what size do I need? The information presented is minimal, just a comma delimited list of wire size+count options. I've tried to find a nice comprehensive table that lays out all the size options that also presents what wire gauge and count combinations that each size supports, but have yet to find anything- certainly seems to be nothing in the product descriptions here on Amazon.",

Even veteran contractors often do not know this product exists and it is a lifesaver. Due to the increase in use of Wi-Fi thermostats, which require a common, more people are using similar products. This is because Wi-Fi thermostats require a common . If a common ids required, you must have a minimum of five wires and many homes were wired with four wires if they had single stage heat abd mercury thermostats. This is a common issue with older hones. Another issue is that Low-voltage wiring is very fine and it is hard copper, not stranded. So, age can allow for deterioration and breakage causing problems. Since thermostat wires can be very difficult to pull, depending on if the wire is nailed inside the trusses, inside the walls, in a multi level home or condo, this product can also provide a replacement for a broken wire for a standard stat. This inexpensive product allows us to forgo running a new thermostat wire, at several hundred dollars expense to the customer. We can provide a replacement wire for a daily wine when pulling a new wire is difficult or cost prohibitive, or provide the common needed when needed for a wifi stat when only 4 wires exist.

They closely replicate the original cloth-covered power cords of the 1920s and '30s. The Rayon cover of this cord will fray when cut so you may want to do the following for best results when cutting and terminating the wire. before cutting the wire use a match or small heat gun to \"cook\" the rayon about 1.25 inches long. Cut the cord in the center of the melted area then use a good wite stripper to remove the insulation. Be sure to leave some of the melted rayon behind or the rayon will fray and make a mess. If the outer rayon does fray don't touch it, just hit it with a match or lighter flame and it will self seal as it melts. The rayon is thin so don't overdo it with the heat or it will melt holes in it. If you are replacing an old power cord add a fuse holder with a properly sized fuse to the device you are repairing to make it safer. Overall this cord looks and works great!"

This kit is particularly appealing for its thoughtful compilation of essential wiring needs, presented in a user-friendly package. Variety and Quality: One of the standout features of this kit is the variety it offers—eight colors of 18 gauge silicone wire, each extending to 23 feet (7 meters). While the length of each spool might not cater to extensive projects, the assortment allows for ample experimentation and small-scale builds. The choice of silicone for the wire sheathing is a commendable one, providing a durable, heat-resistant covering that forgives the occasional soldering mishap, making it an ideal selection for beginners. Additionally, silicone's chemical resistance and flexibility are qualities that veteran electronics enthusiasts will appreciate. Accessories and Utility: The inclusion of color-coordinated heat shrink tubing and zip ties adds a layer of organization and professionalism to projects, enhancing the overall utility of the kit. While the wire stripper may not impress seasoned users, it's a valuable addition for those just starting, offering an all-in-one solution to basic wiring needs. Packaging and Design: The kit's packaging is notably well-conceived, featuring a box with holes for each wire spool, facilitating easy access and storage. This system helps maintain a clean and organized workspace, a boon for any project. However, the opportunity for improvement lies in the visibility of the remaining wire on each spool; a clear plastic window on the box would have perfectly rounded out the design by allowing users to gauge their wire stock at a glance. Conclusion: In summary, the 18 Gauge Wire Kit earns a solid five-star rating not through groundbreaking innovation but through the thoughtful assembly of high-quality components tailored to meet the needs of both novice and experienced electronics enthusiasts. It stands out as a comprehensive and practical kit, perfect for anyone looking to embark on or expand their electronics projects with a reliable selection of wires and tools at their disposal."

It makes it less painful to trace wires to their appropriate I/O (e.g. motors, buttons, etc). The box having holes for each spool is a creative touch that makes it trivial to pull out wire without having to actually open the box. The additional wire stripper was unnecessary to add, but a nice touch for hobbyists who might not have a lot of equipment. It takes a few attempts to figure out the right technique for stripping the wire, but it is definitely usable in place of a dedicated wire stripper. The wire itself was as-advertised and the high voltage and amperage rating makes this suitable for almost all use cases (beyond excessive power delivery).",

My main concern was if it was real tinned copper or not so I stripped a section and scraped it with a sharp knife until I could clearly see the copper start showing through the tin. So yes, this is definitely real copper. The strands are extremely fine, which is great for flexibility but can make it tough to strip without cutting some. But that's the case with all flexible silicone wire, so no real issue there compared to other brands. These 10' sections came in just loose coils in a resealable pouch, which I guess is fine given how short they are; normally I prefer spools.

The Silicone is so 'rubbery' it's almost hard to cut and both the insulation and the wire is as flexible as the insulation. It doesn't 'hold' a shape well at all it's just so flexible. The high temp insulation makes it nice for soldering, it doesn't shrink off or split out from the heat of nearby soldering - and the temp range is also low (cold). I didn't test it, but the low end spec is -76F.. (So obviously I'd have something special around to make any claim about testing it anywhere near that.) I'll have to pickup a couple new rolls for my next trip to Antarctica (lol). It's a whole bunch heavier at 10 gauge than I normally use but I have a couple projects that will use up most of, if not all of the rolls. I'm adding fog lights to my car and I'm rewiring a couple speakers. It feels so nice that if I have any left, I may just rig up a new set of test leads for my multi-meter. Also available in smaller gauges, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 & 22, those other sizes are probably more commonly used and more in line with the size I'd usually pickup for small general purpose projects - but the fog lights, can draw a bunch of current, so for a 10 ft run in a car, this can handle >200 watts, or plenty enough for my fog lights."

Stiffer in a colder outdoor environment. I did not measure the length to confirm advertised 165 ft though. Conductor appears to be pure copper strands, which is as claimed, not copper coated aluminum. The individual strands are quite fine. I counted 64 strands after stripping. Makes it very flexible and not likely to break after many and extreme bends. See photo. - Was easy to strip. - Actually the product seems fairly generic: there is no branding printed on the jacket nor any identification label on the roll. But you weren't expecting a mainstream brand anyhow, and it's just outdoor low voltage wire. It's fine. Looks like it will hold up in the garden. - One thing to keep in mind is that because it's bare copper wire (not tined, like marine wire) the connections are subject to corrosion from moisture and humidity. Make sure to use a connector method that either bonds the ends (solder) or creates a waterproof barrier to prevent this. - At the time I ordered the 16/2 165ft roll was $41, making it an okay deal, considering it's generic wire. - Hope this helps"

The Higoom wire is particularly easy to handle, far easier to use in tight spaces than stiffer wires, and the tinned copper core makes it very simple to solder, too. Having six colors to choose from to match the color of a splice or repair in car or trailer wiring, along with the included short lengths of shrink tubing, means that 12-volt system repairs can be nearly invisible. The perforated dispensing box is a nice touch for anyone who does such work at a single work station, though I don't think I'll be using that feature.

In the videos the wire coating smoldered but the wire connector did not burn. I found these to be easy to use and easy to verify I had a good connection. And I had enough room to put the wires back into the traditional electricians coil with ground, neutral, hot, and traveler ordering as well as the much deeper insulated smart plug case. Remember that whereas a wire nut can be removed and retightened when using stranded wire, these connectors much be removed and replaced for stranded wire. If one is using solid wire, then the connect can safely be removed and reused. So plan well when connecting them. Use the traditional electricians coiling techniques (same technique they use to prepare the wires during the rough in, prior to the drywall work).",

The people who built my house put GFICI outlets on the back of the house around the pool area and time, and the second owners, have taken their toll on them. For whatever reason, so were taken out by ripping the plastic conduit off the boxes and the wires just cut off. How it ever passed home inspection is beyond me, but being the electrician that I am, I have been working on replacing them. Since I was already in the process, I decided to use this wire since it should cover the code requirements for the outlets. I pulled out the old wire from the subpanel (with the power off, off course). Being in Florida, the old wire was about 50 years old and crusty with the humidity and having had various creatures in there over the years. This wire was fully pliable at 14 gauge, and I had no issues pulling in through the bungs and watertight fittings I had added. I'm a fan of flexible conduit and 14 gauge is much easier to pull through it than 12, but make sure you know your local code requirements (or have a licensed electrician do the work) if you are doing this. I have wired three outlets with this wire and haven't found any issues with it. I found it to be easily workable, strips like I would expect it to, and didn't find any flaws in it. I can't see any fault with recommending this wire for your 14/2 wiring jobs.",

Just plain old copper wire. My only issue is the color. Red and black? Why? In US households, black is standard for the hot lead; white for neutral. Okay; maybe I’m just picky?! Is color why it’s more reasonably priced than alternatives? Regardless, it worked well for my kitchen lighting project. Twists well. Doesn’t break easily. Good insulation.",

        "B0C5T6BGR6 <b>Great project wire for low voltage</b> I got this 20awg cable for 12v projects and the size is perfect for most of my low current power requirements. I wouldn't recommend 20awg to be used for 120v applications. 16awg is generally used for most household devices using120VAC . At 12 volts, (cars, boats, golf carts, etc) this wire can handle general low current applications. Low current for 12v meaning less than 60W/5.00A @ 12ft length or shorter. This cable is not tinned, so it is best suited for interior environments as this wire is not rated to be used where water and moisture can corrode the copper over time, reducing conductivity. The cable is easy to work with using a good set of wire insulation removers (Amazon won't let me post what they really are called). The name of the one I used in the attached video is \"Capri Tools 20010 Precision Wire...\". I've used them for a few years now and I'll never go without one again. Best $30 ever spent on wire tools.

What I Like o Tinned copper strands provide good conductivity -- better than cheaper aluminum. o Flexible and easy to work. o Comes on convenient spools, not just loose loops. o Red and black colors match general \"+\" and \"-\" direct current color conventions for easy identification. o Strips easily and cleanly. What I Don't Like o I couldn't find anything I don't like about this cable. Summary Comments This is high quality 16AWG cable that is flexible, easy to work and strips cleanly.

This 16-gauge, 2-conductor wire is perfect for outdoor direct burial electrical wiring needs, and it is built to last. The copper wire construction is durable and resistant to wear and tear, ensuring that it can withstand the elements and provide reliable performance for years to come. I appreciate the most about this wire is how easy it is to work with. It is flexible and easy to bend, making it easy to route around landscaping features and other obstacles. It is also color-coded for easy identification and installation, which made the process of setting up my outdoor lighting system a breeze. The 50-foot length is more than enough for most outdoor projects, and the low voltage rating ensures that it is safe to use around plants and other outdoor features. This wire is ideal for use with low voltage LED lighting systems, which are becoming increasingly popular for their energy efficiency and ease of use. This cable works great with waterproof connectors, or waterproof wire nuts. Overall, I highly recommend the UBOORY 16/2 Low Voltage Landscape Wire to anyone who is in need of a reliable and high-quality wire for their outdoor electrical needs.

This is ultra flexible, with many super-fine strands and silicone rubber insulation marked 200C (higher than PVC but lower than PTFE). The fine strands (150 of them, but I didn't count!) can be a bit of a challenge when crimping contacts... make sure no microscopic strands escape the crimp -- then it works great. The insulation is thick but soft: very easy to work with but also easily damaged if used in the wrong application. It's the right cable for routing in tight locations, since it's so willing to bend and lay flat... good for DIY drones (flexing arms or retracting legs) or making wiring harnesses that need to flex but are well protected from abrasion and pinching. For more rugged high-temp insulation, consider PTFE but it is much more difficult to work with and hard to find at a reasonable price. As noted by others, some colors are a bit off. Red is clearly orange, and blue is gray-purple. That's okay for my purposes, but maybe not if you are building to a print for assemblies that will be inspected.

        "B0D2NZY48M <b>Good Value Wire Set For DIYers</b> This is a pretty good 18AWG wire set. You get 8 colors, 50ft each, of silicone insulated wire. I've never used silicone insulated wire before, but I'm really liking how flexable and easy to strip it is. I also understand that it can withstand higher temperatures that standard PVC wire. The actual wire itself appears to be of some good quality and is tinned copper. Which will be nice for soldering. A couple of the colors are a little off from what you would normally expect, but they are still close enough and easy to tell apart. The box has holes for easy dispensing of the wire and to keep it from unrolling everywhere. In the kit you also get a good assortment of colored heat shrink tubing and small zip ties so you can color match and make everything look all spiffy. The little wire stripper it comes with is actually pretty good and strips quite well. I like it because it is a great size to put in a compact tool kit like for a motorcycle, boat, car, or whatever you want. If you are like me and do a lot of DIY projects then this kit is a great thing to have on hand. I actually plan to get the 10AWG kit also for higher current projects.

        "B01K4RPB3O <b>Good quality, high strand-count high flexibility tinned wire with silicone rubber insulation</b> This 22 AWG (gauge) silicone insulated wire is excellent for indoor or protected environments where high flexibility/lack of stiffness, and non-melting (or at least melt resistant) insulation is required. The conductors are a 'high strand count\" type, meaning that instead of being comprised of just a few larger/thicker strands, it is instead comprised of a much greater number of smaller/thinner strands; and this contributes to its lack of stiffness/great flexibility. The other contributing factor to the high flexibility is that the insulation is silicone rubber, rather than the more common PVC (which is rather stiff). This kind of high strand count, silicone rubber insulated wire is exactly what high quality test equipment 'test leads' have been made of for decades. The silicone rubber is also much less heat sensitive than more common insulations such as PVC or \"machine tool wire\". It won't melt off as readily as PVC insulation does if your soldering iron needs to be held onto a joint or terminal for an extended period of time. The fine wire strands are also nicely tinned, and the insulation strips off easily and cleanly, and the stranded wire solders easily. It is a good quality product at an affordable price. HOWEVER, it is not the best choice for many common \"hook up wire\" applications, since its lack of stiffness can be an issue; the strands definitely need to be twisted and soldered in order to keep their shape enough to be formed into a hook before soldering around a terminal for example. This wire also does not want to cooperate if you want to twist a few of them together, because their limpness makes them uncooperative in that regard. And if you use this wire in \"hook up wire\" applications, it wants to just flop into some odd position rather than 'staying put' where you want it to be. Silicone rubber insulation is also not that great when it comes to abrasion resistance, and resistance to some kinds of oils and such where other insulations may be preferable."

The Bad: Nothing. These are good cables if they fit your needs. I suggest ferrules or tinning the ends. The stranded wires are extremely thin. Tinning is easy, but takes a little flux and a LOT of solder because the tiny strands soak it up so fast. These wires will take solder, no problem at all. Jacket does not melt, so make sure you add enough heat for solder to penetrate."

My methodology for Vine Program products is to give a more thorough -- often product-destructive -- review. If I like the product, I buy my own version of it, otherwise, it gets donated post-testing. I also may include my opinion on the product's value proposition to the market. REVIEW: -------------------------------- If I was to give a description that people might be able to reference, I'd say this feels like the power cord you'd find on a high-end power tool. It's thick, and doesn't have a strong odor (common in cheaper products). Each comes with some zipties and a few pieces of heat-shrink if you need it. Inspection of the individual wires does seem to indicate tinned copper (instead of tinned aluminum), but I'd need a better device to really tell. At slightly over ~$1/ft, it's not a bad deal if you just need it in a pinch for a project.

I wiped the wall with a damp microfiber to remove any dust and let it dry. I then applied the Ghost Wire starting at one end, peeling about a foot of the backing off at a time, smoothing it and rubbing it to the wall. Working the wrinkles out as I went along. Within one day, both ends of the run had about 6 inches peeling off the wall. Three days later, and both ends are now peeled off about 2 feet. Every morning I've tried to rub it back to the wall. My walls do have a very slight orange peel texture. Perhaps on a smooth finish the Ghost Wire would adhere better. I have not attempted to paint over it yet (and likely won't since it doesn't stay on). The total length of my application was 11.5 feet. Beyond the issue of it not remaining adhered, there were a couple other issues as well. First, there's about 1/8 of clear adhesive which is not covered by the white surface material running down the entire length of the roll. This is very visible (and sticky feeling). I was hoping that I could spray some wall texture over it since paint will likely not cover it correctly. I also snapped off my exposed ends when attaching the end connectors. Since the copper is very thin, any etching done with a razor blade to cleanly expose the copper strips weakens it to the point that any flex will shear it off. I had to peel back and use scissors, leaving a small flap rather than a nice clean transition. My Ghost Wire also was quite wrinkled from being rolled up. The manufacturer states that it's a known issue and recommends a heatgun/hairdryer to remedy so I expected that going in I liked the idea of this product. If it would have stayed on the wall, it would have been great. Even with the problems I had, I could see this working well if run under a carpet. I'm contemplating using a router to notch a shallow channel in the drywall and then just mud over the inserted wire. [update] A week later, and it's completely peeled off. Not an inch is left stuck to the wall. It's just hanging between the two connector blocks that are screwed in."

I'm not sure the Amazon listing made it clear that this is UL approved, but it is. I measured the outside diameter at .225\", and peeling back the Rayon cover reveals a round white PVC jacket that is .210\" diameter. The PVC makes this cord rugged but also quite stiff compared to true antique (and less safe) cloth-covered cord that was usually just one or two cloth layers wound directly over the two individually-insulated conductors, but without the extra molded PVC jacket. Vintage cord used on lamps, radios, and other electrical devices usually was a little less bulky, more flexible and sometimes had an oval cross-section rather than round. This cord is well-suited for modern retro lighting and restoration applications where extreme flexibility and the ability to hang naturally under its own weight over short lengths is not a requirement. For greater flexibility, twisted cloth-covered cord is available from other sources. This has each PVC coated conductor individually wrapped in cloth and the pair of wires twisted together, yielding greater flexibility.

I have had to throw away pure copper wire from the 70s since it develops green oxidation and is a pain to clean but have yet to have to clean tinned copper before crimping or soldering. This wire has fewer strands that are larger and a heavy PVC outer coating, compared to the small strand silicon coated wire I use for RC helicopters. This makes it stiffer, easier to route, and tougher. I wouldn't hesitate to walk on this wire or pull it across metal edges that would cut silicon insulation. The larger strands are also better for crimping since smaller strands are more likely to break at the crimp.

Fortunately, this is the perfect size for testing, and it is available in other length options, so it's worth experimenting before committing to a larger project."

        "B0CWNBZ164 <b>It's as awesome as wire gets. Good price. Pleasant to work with.</b> There's just not a lot to say on this. It is flexy and easy to work with. It doesn't tangle/bulge internally and it coils sensibly. My wire gauge confirms it's 22awg. I plan to use this in my hobby of LED lighting controllers where this works well to send data, ground, and +VDC (5, 12, 24) to the strands from each transformer. I was pleased at the way this is packaged. Instead of being on a spool that explodes with released tension when uncoiled, this is on a larger plastic spool that's easy to \"tie off\" for reuse and very closely matches (coincidence?) the spools that LEDs come on, allowing them to live harmoniously in a box or standing on end in a file cabinet. The sheath strips nicely. The wires tin well. The cable doesn't sproing into a garage door spring at pressure when released from the package to use. It's a good price. If you need wire at the specifications listed, it's hard to go wrong here. While there are a number of variables involved, the required math is pretty straight-forward. 22G is about 43.4 ohms per km or 0.0434 ohms.per meter. Your project may not be running all channels at max brightness on all bulbs (RGB...and sometimes W) at the same time or it may be doing so for only a fraction of a second. Doing it for hours inside a packed conduit is different than an air-gapped conduit or being in the open. Just doing some quick math, let's imagine a 241 WS2812 project (like a Hexagon or a short strip) where each bulb is pulling .60ma per bulb (full intensity, white, and eye-torching white ON) That's a 14.5 W fixture at 24V, so you can use 22 gauge wire like this to drive 283feet and still lose only 1VDC at 24V. (It's worse at low voltages - this is why you want high voltages if wire length matters. It's the reason the power company lines to you are at 10's of thousands of volts....) If you're just doing boosters into taps, I'd imagine the distance to be even longer. 22Gauge is a good tradeoff of \"easy to work with\" and \"enough copper to deliver your electrons without resistance\" (hahahhaa. Ohm's Law jokes never get old.) I also did a spot test on painting it and it seems to take paint acceptably well. Some of this spool is probably going to end up in a permanent fixture that's tucked/painted into a corner of mine. This cable seems to be everything it claims to be and a nice set of specs for consumer lighting. Not fusable strands. Not chunky/expensive solid copper. Recommended."

The black/red/yellow conductors are convenient for many applications that have power/ground/control requirements within the 300V 2.2A rating. The -40℃ to + 80℃ temperature range also make it suitable for most DIY projects.

I'm not sure the Amazon listing made it clear that this is UL approved, but it is. I measured the outside diameter at .225\", and peeling back the Rayon cover reveals a round white PVC jacket that is .210\" diameter. The PVC makes this cord rugged but also quite stiff compared to true antique (and less safe) cloth-covered cord that was usually just one or two cloth layers wound directly over the two individually-insulated conductors, but without the extra molded PVC jacket. Vintage cord used on lamps, radios, and other electrical devices usually was a little less bulky, more flexible and sometimes had an oval cross-section rather than round. This cord is well-suited for modern retro lighting and restoration applications where extreme flexibility and the ability to hang naturally under its own weight over short lengths is not a requirement. For greater flexibility, twisted cloth-covered cord is available from other sources. This has each PVC coated conductor individually wrapped in cloth and the pair of wires twisted together, yielding greater flexibility. Several years ago I had to buy cord like this for an antique replica that I built, and I paid a lot more buying it from an antique radio part supplier.

It is a reasonable facsimile for either replacing antiquated electrical wiring in old lamps and such, or adding a little extra visual flair to current devices. Of course, when replacing old wiring, you are also gaining the safety of a cord that is using modern insulating materials, which is much safer at this point, than older wiring which may have very dry and brittle insulation layers between the strands of wire. The only comment I can make about it that may be a negative factor for some is that the cord is round, rather than most lamp cord that tends to be a bit flattened.

I should have taken a picture to prove my point, but I am not exaggerating. 12awg solid core wire is pretty stiff anyways, but the added thickness of the jacket makes it even stiffer. Once again, a blessing and a curse. Thicker jacket, more protection, but it takes a bit more work to trim the jacket back. I suppose in bulk, the additional jacket thickness would contribute to the weight of the product as well, but it wasn't noticeable in the 25ft length I ordered. The 12awg wires stripped perfectly with my wire strippers without gauging the conductors."

Super strong liquid-tight flex conduit, but a bear to straighten. Fortunately, it can be cut to fit by popping off end fitting, sliding the three wires just behind the intended cut, and neatly sawing off excess using a rod saw blade. Dress up the cut surface, pull the wires back out, and secure a liquid-tight 1/2 in. compression end fitting to complete the process. Got it fitted to a 3x2x 3 1/2 in. deep switch box, attached thermostat wires, and good to go. Yes, the whip can be cut to fit, just take a bit of care to pull conductors back away from cutting blade, and use a proper end fitting for secure attachment."

However, this is good line for all weather outdoor use. On/in/under a vehicle, and is going to handle friction and stretching well. It is UL2464 Complaint, which means in a nutshell: It’s certified safe as an “external interconnect cable”. AKA: You’re alright using this outside; even burying it underground. The wire jackets/sheathing itself are robust and flexible as with the primary jacket/sheath. It also has a good bit of copper (tin also) in its makeup. This on paper and upon observation this is very good wire. I wouldn’t use it to jump a car battery, or wire up a competition car audio system (been there, done that, and was a garage manager) but low power on/off applications in all weather environments, you’re going to be just fine.

I usually buy my lugs directly from sky high car audio, but I was in a bit of a money pinch so $10 for a pack of 10 didn’t seem that worth it at the time. I ended up coming across these bad boys, which happened to be the best deal around. 50 lugs for less than $40. Honestly I was pretty hyped. I ended up remember that car audio 1/0 is not standard 1/0 welding wire. It’s actually oversized 1/0…so right in between 1/0-2/0. I decided to go for the 2/0 lugs and purchased 50 of them. I tested it out on 1/0 sky high wire and it fit like a GLOVE. The 2/0 lug itself is smaller than sky high 1/0 lug, which was kinda nice because I am working on tight space. I did try the 2/0 lug on some sky high 2/0 and there’s no chance it would go in. Maybe if you force a ton, but even then it won’t work. I couldn’t even get the head of the wire in and these lugs are flared outwards too. I haven’t crimped them yet but I will soon, I’ll update the review when I get to crimping stage. But as of now, they get a 5/5 for fitting oversized 1/0 car audio wire. Update 3/6/22: crimping is absolutely awesome. I have two types of crimpers, hydraulics and handheld $30 crimpers from amazon. I decided to use the handheld crimper, even though it doesn't go up to 2/0 size. Stuck it on the 1/0 setting and did 2 crimps at the bottom and top of the lug. Had my dad pull one end of the wire while I held the lug end of the wire. We both pulled as hard as we could and it didn't even move. I'd say they work as intended.",

Some bulbs have gone out due to failing electrical connectors. I tried replacing the connectors, but the insulation on the existing wire has become so hard that the prongs on the connectors just don’t penetrate correctly anymore. I ordered this to replace that hardened landscape wire. Unfortunately, the Quic Disc connectors I used previously do not work with this wire. Its insulation is slightly thinner than the original wire, and the conductors are spaced closer together. The Quic Disc prongs don’t align properly with the new conductors. If one prong hits the center of one conductor, the other prong can miss the other conductor entirely. The lights are only a few feet apart in a long flower bed, and I didn’t want to cut this wire into many short segments to use wire nuts at each light. So I tried the new Malibu Low Voltage Cable Connectors that pierce the insulation from both sides. They work perfectly, and have the advantage that the wire doesn’t have to be split apart every few feet to use an alternate piercing connector. Bottom line, this is great wire, with real copper conductors and flexible insulation that is easy to work with.

        "B001EX57ZK <b>Excellent. Buy this!</b> It's odd to see people downgrading this stuff for being exactly the way it's supposed to be. I have bought this twice because it's strong, predictable, flexible enough to wrap around itself by hand on a screw eye, absolutely rust free, and forgiving of my putting a ridiculous amount of tension on it. It will hold my excessive unhealthy weight. I can shove spare extra lumber on top of this wire after stringing it across the bottom edges of open rafters in the garage. Has never broken nor stretched over the 24 inch spaces it spans. ALL steel wire will stretch, depending on how you work it, over longer distances. However, I haven't re-tensioned the first roll at all since stringing a bunch of lights three years ago. One run is 53 feet with 50 lights on it. I needed something like this because it's ruinous to the light string to put any meaningful tension directly to a string and so you have to support the string on something like this. Don't bother with cables as that's huge and expensive overkill and they're hard to terminate. Don't use poly or fabric line; they WILL sag. If you have problems with the wire keeping some of its curl, that's absolutely normal. It's coiled steel! Add much tension and then back off a bit. Remember that light strings have a significant straightening effect. If it's snarling when you try to unwind it, most likely you're uncoiling from the outside, not the inside end. Been that way since they invented the stuff a few centuries ago. OR you can unroll it from the outside end after mounting it like a wheel to a horizontal bar (F-clamp, broom handle or pipe propped in a step ladder, and such).",
        "B0CSD3KPX3 <b>Perfect Gauge</b> In the beginning, I thought I needed a 12 gauge low-voltage landscape wire. Then after coming to my senses, I realized that with LED lighting, the 16 gauge is much easier to work with, and I really don't see any voltage drop-off despite a 120 foot run. As an added bonus, if you're using a SkilSaw to cut a groove in the 2x4 supporting your deck railing to hide the wire, the 16 gauge wire fits the groove perfectly when you stand the cord on its side. The 12 gauge is just laughing at you and telling you to go get a router."

Both the outer jacket and wire insulation are easily stripped with a quality tool and I did not experience any issues with broken conductors. The black/red/yellow conductors are convenient for many applications that have power/ground/control requirements within the 300V 2.2A rating. The -40℃ to + 80℃ temperature range also make it suitable for most DIY projects. The 22 AWG conductors are perfect for DuPont connectors, which are convenient for jumper wires, electronic projects, and testing."

It doesn't tangle/bulge internally and it coils sensibly. My wire gauge confirms it's 22awg. I plan to use this in my hobby of LED lighting controllers where this works well to send data, ground, and +VDC (5, 12, 24) to the strands from each transformer. I was pleased at the way this is packaged. Instead of being on a spool that explodes with released tension when uncoiled, this is on a larger plastic spool that's easy to \"tie off\" for reuse and very closely matches (coincidence?) the spools that LEDs come on, allowing them to live harmoniously in a box or standing on end in a file cabinet. The sheath strips nicely. The wires tin well. The cable doesn't sproing into a garage door spring at pressure when released from the package to use. It's a good price. If you need wire at the specifications listed, it's hard to go wrong here. While there are a number of variables involved, the required math is pretty straight-forward. 22G is about 43.4 ohms per km or 0.0434 ohms.per meter. Your project may not be running all channels at max brightness on all bulbs (RGB...and sometimes W) at the same time or it may be doing so for only a fraction of a second. Doing it for hours inside a packed conduit is different than an air-gapped conduit or being in the open. Just doing some quick math, let's imagine a 241 WS2812 project (like a Hexagon or a short strip) where each bulb is pulling .60ma per bulb (full intensity, white, and eye-torching white ON) That's a 14.5 W fixture at 24V, so you can use 22 gauge wire like this to drive 283feet and still lose only 1VDC at 24V. (It's worse at low voltages - this is why you want high voltages if wire length matters. It's the reason the power company lines to you are at 10's of thousands of volts....) If you're just doing boosters into taps, I'd imagine the distance to be even longer. 22Gauge is a good tradeoff of \"easy to work with\" and \"enough copper to deliver your electrons without resistance\" (hahahhaa. Ohm's Law jokes never get old.) I also did a spot test on painting it and it seems to take paint acceptably well. Some of this spool is probably going to end up in a permanent fixture that's tucked/painted into a corner of mine. This cable seems to be everything it claims to be and a nice set of specs for consumer lighting. Not fusable strands. Not chunky/expensive solid copper. Recommended.",

Some brands advertise 30 feet, but later, you find out they meant 15 feet black and 15 feet red. I can confirm that the wire is copper and not just coated. The insulation feels durable. It is thick but still very easy to bend. This is great if you dont have a straight shot where you are running it. I have the cable running from my solar panel on the roof down to my solar controller.

I did cut off a few pieces to make some MC4 cables. This cable has been through storms, the sun, rain, etc... even through the bad weather, it has held up great.

This is ultra flexible, with many super-fine strands and silicone rubber insulation marked 200C (higher than PVC but lower than PTFE). The fine strands (150 of them, but I didn't count!) can be a bit of a challenge when crimping contacts... make sure no microscopic strands escape the crimp -- then it works great. The insulation is thick but soft: very easy to work with but also easily damaged if used in the wrong application. It's the right cable for routing in tight locations, since it's so willing to bend and lay flat... good for DIY drones (flexing arms or retracting legs) or making wiring harnesses that need to flex but are well protected from abrasion and pinching. For more rugged high-temp insulation, consider PTFE but it is much more difficult to work with and hard to find at a reasonable price. As noted by others, some colors are a bit off. Red is clearly orange, and blue is gray-purple. That's okay for my purposes, but maybe not if you are building to a print for assemblies that will be inspected.

        "B0B6PGY65W <b>Its a good decision to buy!</b> I recently purchased the TYUMEN 40FT 18 Gauge 2pin 2 Color Red Black Cable Hookup Electrical Wire for my LED strip lighting project and I have to say, I am quite pleased with the product. The wire is of good quality and it has met my expectations. One of the main reasons I purchased this wire was for its length. The 40FT wire is long enough to cover the entire length of my LED strip lighting project and it provides enough slack to make the installation process much easier. The 2pin 2 color red black cable also makes it easy to identify the positive and negative wires, which is very helpful during the installation process. The red and black color coding also helps me to keep track of the connections and ensure that everything is connected properly. The 18-gauge wire is also thick enough to handle the current of my LED strip lights, which I found to be a big plus. It ensures that the wire can handle the power and prevents any potential overheating or damage to the wire. The only downside to this product is that the wire is a bit stiff, it's not very flexible which can make it a bit difficult to bend and shape to the desired position. But it's a small price to pay for the quality and durability of the wire. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the TYUMEN 40FT 18 Gauge 2pin 2 Color Red Black Cable Hookup Electrical Wire for LED Strips. It's a great investment for anyone who wants a high-quality and durable wire for their LED strip lighting projects. It's not perfect, but it's a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable electrical wire.",

So, I hopped on Amazon to find a good replacement/upgrade. I was originally looking at 5-wire cables (after all, that's all I really needed), but then I saw this 18-gauge, 8-wire cable for just a few dollars more and decided to go with it instead. This would provide a degree of future-proofing (such as adding a whole-house humidifier, extra sensors, or the like in the future). This 18-gauge, 8-wire cable was thicker and stiffer than my old 20-gauge (?), 4-wire cable, and thus a bit trickier to pull through the wall from the thermostat to the furnace (be sure to check your cable path first to ensure it will fit (width of thru-holes, radius of bends, etc.). But, I just taped one end of the new cable to the old cable, crossed my fingers, and started a pullin'. Thankfully, with a bit of elbow grease, it worked!

The conductors are fine stranded, tinned copper, which is a thin protective coating on the copper to keep it from corroding in harsh environments such as ocean areas, or auto applications where winter road salting can cause problems. Despite what other reviewers have said, this is indeed copper wire, but the “tinning” process makes the wire appear silver unless you look at the cut end. It is typically used with crimp connectors in most applications. There is no indication that this wire is UL listed, so I would not use it for home-wiring applications or any 120 volt (or higher) AC current. The silicone insulation and fine stranding make this wire very flexible, so perfect for sharp turns and pulling through tight locations like behind the dash. The 14 gauge that I used is good for any circuits of up to 10 amps unless they are longer than 25 feet or so. Remember to calculate for both positive and negative lengths, and whether you can afford any voltage drop in your circuit. Circuits for an automotive refrigerator or fog lamps, which have extended use times for example, are different than a circuit for a horn, which is only used for a couple seconds at a time.

However, the box is so tight, you can barely get it to close, so, when closed, it does not allow the individual spools to move freely at all.

I will be using it to rewire an old vintage lamp to get rid of the vinyl/plastic modern wire. I think it is a good choice to re-wire a valuable antique item as well. This wire is flexible but not as limp as most appliance wire. At first I thought the reason must be solid copper instead of stranded copper inside, which would be very strange. It's stranded not solid, however, and the lack of limpness is because the black-coated and white-coated copper stranded wires inside are embedded in a PVC 'cord' that is completely solid. In other words, there isn't a PVC tubing containing the 2 inner wires but rather a solid mass of PVC. Thus the whole thing is sturdier and heftier than it would be if it were a cloth covering over a PVC tubing containing 2 wires.

I don't have a multimeter sensitive enough to measure just 23 feet of wire as in this kit, but my multimeter was bouncing between .1 and .2 ohms. Right in the ballpark of .14 ohms for 23 feet that I calculate I should have. Sorry I didn't have enough hands to measure the wire and get a picture too. I also held the wire over a flame for several seconds. The insulation stood up just fine without and visible damage to the wire. The wire itself is very flexible and I like the silicone insulation.

        "B09VGLY361 <b>Great quality automotive & marine wire</b> This is perfect wire for automotive use, including campers and marine applications. The conductors are fine stranded, tinned copper, which is a thin protective coating on the copper to keep it from corroding in harsh environments such as ocean areas, or auto applications where winter road salting can cause problems. Despite what other reviewers have said, this is indeed copper wire, but the “tinning” process makes the wire appear silver unless you look at the cut end. It is typically used with crimp connectors in most applications. There is no indication that this wire is UL listed, so I would not use it for home-wiring applications or any 120 volt (or higher) AC current. The silicone insulation and fine stranding make this wire very flexible, so perfect for sharp turns and pulling through tight locations like behind the dash. The 14 gauge that I used is good for any circuits of up to 10 amps unless they are longer than 25 feet or so. Remember to calculate for both positive and negative lengths, and whether you can afford any voltage drop in your circuit. Circuits for an automotive refrigerator or fog lamps, which have extended use times for example, are different than a circuit for a horn, which is only used for a couple seconds at a time. This seems to be a very good quality and well manufactured wire, and is available in a wide variety of gauges, both red and black.",
        "B09VGLY361 <b>Easy to work with for small projects.</b> I needed some very thin gauge wire to do some small low volt DC projects with. The quality of wire wasn’t as important for this so I didn’t mind taking a chance on an unknown brand. So far, this seems to be as good as anything I can source locally, and 10 cents a foot keeps the price competitive. I like the silicone jacket. It makes the wire very easy to work with. I was worried it wouldn’t hold up as well to the heat of soldering, but I was very careful and had no issues. It was too small to really use a crimp connector so I did mostly soldering and heat shrink. The tinned wire took solder well and I didn’t have any issues with connectivity or creating a solid connection. I didn’t have my calipers handy to check this versus other 20 AWG wire but it seemed comparable. Even so, sometime manufactures use more insulation and less metal to give it the impression that it is the same size. With wire I am unfamiliar with, I always size up against the standard AWG amp ratings just to be safe. It’s hard to say if the jacket will hold up to harsh conditions. For my purposes, it’s being used inside an enclosure and is well-protected. If you’re going to use this for automotive, marine or exterior projects, I’d leave a piece of wire outside for a while to test it before committing to a full project. Overall, a good value wire option if you don’t have a power hungry circuit where only the best will do.",

Now pair that price with this, albeit rather inexpensive yet thoughtful / considerate box, and you've got yourself quite the little deal but now I'm a tad bit mad at myself for not spending 6 or 7 more dollars and getting the same six colored wires @ 100 feet each. However that deal features PVC (Poly Vinyl Chloride) covered wires and not silicone. The main reason why I prefer the silicone covered wires is because Silicone handles high temps really well and is flame / high heat resistant whereas PVC has a tendency to catch on fire. Silicone covered wires may have a softer feel to them and will actually feel much different compared to the traditional PVC covered wires your used to buying but at the end of the silicone is superior to PVC in a lot of ways so to each his own. The other feature that I preferred over this particular deal over the PVC covered wires option was the fact that these wires are ''tinned copper\" which, from what my research has told me, is that that feature helps with durability and longevity of the wires itself so there you have it.

This has 5 fifty foot rolls of 5 colors that should end the scrounging. This is a copper clad aluminum core (CCA) wire. The copper reduces corrosion caused by moisture and oxidation and adds surface conductivity. I got it to use for some small 12V wiring projects in the RV (additional 12 volt computer fan for gas refrigerator cooling) and to have on hand when I just need some short lengths of wire. For reference, Cu Clad Al (CCA) wire can be used for main wire projects but at a much larger gauge as aluminum has a higher resistance than copper. 12 AWG is recommended for a 15 Amp 110V circuit and 10 AWG for a 20 Amp. This is a 36 strand 16 AWG braided wire so it's not made for heavy loads or 110 volt wiring. Specs are for up to 80 volts. The wire is flexible and there's enough copper coating for it to solder easily to itself. If there's trouble having the wire stick, a copper infused solder works. I used some lead free Rosin Core 2.0 Sn99 Ag0.3 Cu0.7 electronics solder and everything was sucked into the wire and stuck together. I couldn't find the percent by weight of copper anywhere on the rolls, package, or website. The range for CCA is anywhere from 10% to 24% by weight, with the more the better (but also more expensive). 15 small zip ties and 10 heat shrink tubes are included in the box. I'm never going to use this on a main AC wiring project but for small electrical projects, it's a good economical choice and should last a long time.

        "B0C5FC1KJZ <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again)."

It doesn't tangle/bulge internally and it coils sensibly. My wire gauge confirms it's 22awg. I plan to use this in my hobby of LED lighting controllers where this works well to send data, ground, and +VDC (5, 12, 24) to the strands from each transformer. I was pleased at the way this is packaged. Instead of being on a spool that explodes with released tension when uncoiled, this is on a larger plastic spool that's easy to \"tie off\" for reuse and very closely matches (coincidence?) the spools that LEDs come on, allowing them to live harmoniously in a box or standing on end in a file cabinet. The sheath strips nicely. The wires tin well. The cable doesn't sproing into a garage door spring at pressure when released from the package to use. It's a good price. If you need wire at the specifications listed, it's hard to go wrong here. While there are a number of variables involved, the required math is pretty straight-forward. 22G is about 43.4 ohms per km or 0.0434 ohms.per meter. Your project may not be running all channels at max brightness on all bulbs (RGB...and sometimes W) at the same time or it may be doing so for only a fraction of a second. Doing it for hours inside a packed conduit is different than an air-gapped conduit or being in the open. Just doing some quick math, let's imagine a 241 WS2812 project (like a Hexagon or a short strip) where each bulb is pulling .60ma per bulb (full intensity, white, and eye-torching white ON) That's a 14.5 W fixture at 24V, so you can use 22 gauge wire like this to drive 283feet and still lose only 1VDC at 24V. (It's worse at low voltages - this is why you want high voltages if wire length matters. It's the reason the power company lines to you are at 10's of thousands of volts....) If you're just doing boosters into taps, I'd imagine the distance to be even longer. 22Gauge is a good tradeoff of \"easy to work with\" and \"enough copper to deliver your electrons without resistance\" (hahahhaa. Ohm's Law jokes never get old.) I also did a spot test on painting it and it seems to take paint acceptably well. Some of this spool is probably going to end up in a permanent fixture that's tucked/painted into a corner of mine. This cable seems to be everything it claims to be and a nice set of specs for consumer lighting. Not fusable strands. Not chunky/expensive solid copper. Recommended."

This wire should only be used for a table lamp, from the lamp to the wall plug. The other concerning feature is 18ga copper. The copper stains are too thin to work-with, they are brittle to bend around a connection screw. Soldering is required to support the stains. Why the industry has gone to such small gauge 18ga ( setting aside the min amps & volts ) is because they have never rewire an appliance. 16ga should be the workable appliance size wire."

The PVC sheathing on this wire is smooth and I was able to easily pull it through a conduit to replace an old wire with just some electrical tape joining the ends.

I like that this wire is rated for direct burial and waterproof, so long as it remains undamaged. It's easy enough to slide this through some conduit or at least sections of old garden hose or something to make it more durable and resist chafing.

The downside that I've seen - the connectors on these seem a bit brittle. After finishing the first install (electrical) I was installing the refrigeration lineset. When I removed the cover, I put a little force (I do mean little) on the side of this whip - and the connector broke cleanly away from the conduit. I've not had this happen with ones I've put together on my own - and now get to repair this one - which kind of negates why I bought it in the first place. C'est la vie. If you're gentle with them, and don't mind the fixed length - they can save you a little time (and if you don't have any THHN on hand, money - especially if you just need a short length) - but if you don't mind spending just a little more time... roll your own."

        "B0CL75YXB3 <b>Appears to be true 16ga wire (unlike some others)</b> I've bought other similar spools of multi-conductor cable, and I've learned that you have to be careful about what you're getting. In one case, I ordered a 50' spool of 18 gauge wire that turned out to be a good 20% smaller, giving 20% higher resistance. So -- the first thing I wanted to check on this wire was the resistance of a single conductor through the length of the whole spool. Granted, I haven't unwound it to measure its length, so I'm taking that part at face value. The principle here is that any copper wire of a certain cross-sectional area (i.e. gauge) will have a given resistance per foot. There are many free online wire resistance calculators that will tell you just what the total resistance should be, when you provide it with the length and wire gauge. In this case, 50' of 16ga wire should be 0.201 ohms. As you can see in the photo, that's exactly what I have, within the precision of the meter I was using. It was actually flipping occasionally between 0.19 - 0.21 but typically sat on 0.20 ohms, which is pretty firm confirmation that this is, in fact, 16ga wire. Having confirmed that fact, I'm happy to recommend this cable for all intended purposes. The individual wires are easy to strip, have thick insulation, and the black outer sheath is sturdy and slick. Within each 16ga wire, the individual strands are pre-tinned, which gives much better corrosion resistance for when you're working in a wet, or otherwise corrosive, environment (like on a boat's wiring or other marine environment). Nice product, exactly as claimed.",

The box having holes for each spool is a creative touch that makes it trivial to pull out wire without having to actually open the box. The additional wire stripper was unnecessary to add, but a nice touch for hobbyists who might not have a lot of equipment. It takes a few attempts to figure out the right technique for stripping the wire, but it is definitely usable in place of a dedicated wire stripper.

My only issue with this design is, with the wire inside the box, you can't see how much you have left. With some colours, 16ft goes quickly. I absolutely enjoy the colour matching zip ties and heat shrink. I hate putting black heat shrink on coloured wire. Drives me crazy. When I first opened the box, I laughed at the wire stripper. I was going to bash it, but honestly, it's not bad. Works better and safer than me pushing wire between my thumb and pocket knife blade.

        "B0CSD35PQT <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone.",

The outer sleeve is the perfect consistency as well, and the inner wire is \"loose\" enough inside that when cutting the outer sleeve there's little danger of also cutting the wire. It also cuts extremely easily, meaning no scoring multiple times trying to get to the wire inside. The insulation on the wires seems like standard insulation, not the gel-type thick insulation found on other brands of speaker wire. If you do a lot of wiring, this is key as a standard wire stripper works great with it - a real time saver.

I have had to throw away pure copper wire from the 70s since it develops green oxidation and is a pain to clean but have yet to have to clean tinned copper before crimping or soldering. This wire has fewer strands that are larger and a heavy PVC outer coating, compared to the small strand silicon coated wire I use for RC helicopters. This makes it stiffer, easier to route, and tougher. I wouldn't hesitate to walk on this wire or pull it across metal edges that would cut silicon insulation. The larger strands are also better for crimping since smaller strands are more likely to break at the crimp.

I expected a durable tool that would last me through numerous projects, but instead, I was left with a broken tool after just a few days. I would not recommend these pliers to anyone looking for reliability and durability in their tools."

Well, one minor issue I did have is with JST-SM crimping, which is intended to be used with 22 AWG. Sometimes (10% of the time) this 20 AWG wire would break due to over crimping -- and it's not obvious when it's partially broken. I had faulty connections (like tapping it may cause it to start/stop working). I had to adjust to the wire gauge by not crimping as hard."

In summary the product as described is very misleading, clearly shown is on the image is copper wires (In reality it is copper clad aluminum). I read \"Multiple Reviews\" on the lower scored Amazon reviews of the Copper Clad Aluminum wiring turning to dust or cannot be soldered. The conductivity rating from NEC {National Electrical Code} for 14 GA Aluminum wire is null \"not rated\"). NEC code only starts at 12 gauge, however it does not address Copper Clad Aluminum. This Copper Clad Aluminum from the unwrapped spool, appears to be of high quality, However I am returning it for misleading advertising and the concerns with galvanic corrosion when terminating this wiring to anything but connectors certified to accept aluminum (Yes it copper clad, I am being conservative). I am concerned with persons purchasing this product thinking it is copper (look at as advertised picture). 14 GA copper is rated for 15 amps (My best guess for this wiring is 3A, After severe derating).

Cost is always a consideration when working on projects. What is CCA wire? It’s a copper cladded aluminum wire, meaning that the outer layer is coated with copper while the inner core is aluminum. How does CCA work? The copper clad aluminum isn’t going to have the same conductive or durable performance as a pure copper, but it is pretty good. What’s to like? For non mission critical projects, the advantage of a CCA wire is cost as it is less than the cost of pure copper. What’s not to like? It’s not as durable and it has a higher resistance than pure copper. In conclusion, if you’re working on lots of non mission critical low voltage projects, the CCA wires can be a great cost saving while still getting decent performance. That said, I’m giving this product 5 stars."

Once I rewired my lamps, I found that I love the vintage look of the wire so I decided to make some \"vintage\" extension cords using repro antique plugs and some new old stock surface mount receptacles. They look really cool, and they don't spoil the vintage look of my room and my lamps. Just remember that this is 18 gauge wire so you don't want it to be carrying more than 15 amps.
