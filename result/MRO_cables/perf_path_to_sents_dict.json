I have a transformer that I attached the wire to and I went around my yard with the wire making sure to leave a lot of slack for if I need to adjust the lights. I didn't bury it yet as I'm still adding lights, but so far, so good. I haven't had any issues with it fraying or being too hard to twist the strands together. They do as wires are supposed to do. I have waterproof connectors that I use, but this is my first time using outdoor wiring. So far, it has rained last night and I didn't notice any issues. The lights worked all night long and when my transformer got the light of the day, it shut off well too. I needed this because I ran out of wire, so this extra makes me able to finalize my setup. I have had no issues so far, and it fits in my connectors just fine. My lights at the end of my strand are just as bright as the ones at the beginning. I like it. It works for me!

Pop the motherboard plate off, hook the supplied cable into it, and then run it with zip ties up the already zip tied black cables to the print head, next, choose the correct mount (It comes with a few) for your printer and attach the CR touch to it then attach the mount with supplied screws. The semi hardest part was actually installing an update required for my printer, but that's only because Creality's website wasn't clear where I needed to go and the instruction booklet link wasn't correct. A quick google search solved that, downloaded it to an SD card and put it in my printer, turned it on, and it automatically installed the new firmware for the touch. Another thing I learned through trial and error is this renders your z axis switch in operable and it must be unplugged meaning, you have to now use a Z-axis offset on your printer to level. After you figure out what it is, just hit auto level and you're golden!",

Use a holesaw to cut the opening quickly, or a jigsaw will work fine too but takes more effort. Once installed, the product works well and easily accommodates our 10awg speaker wire. 8 awg would probably fit fine with a bare wire too. Using a speaker pin (you can search Amazon for 'speaker pin') makes it even easier to connect speaker wire to this. The spring terminal works well and holds well. On the internal side, there's a nut that can be used to hold the wiring. I used a ring terminal to terminate my wire and used the nut to fasten it to the inside terminals. You can use a spade terminal or solder your inside cabling to it, but if you use a soldering iron make sure it's higher wattage so you can properly heat the terminal and wire to melt the solder."

I have a transformer that I attached the wire to and I went around my yard with the wire making sure to leave a lot of slack for if I need to adjust the lights. I didn't bury it yet as I'm still adding lights, but so far, so good. I haven't had any issues with it fraying or being too hard to twist the strands together. They do as wires are supposed to do. I have waterproof connectors that I use, but this is my first time using outdoor wiring. So far, it has rained last night and I didn't notice any issues. The lights worked all night long and when my transformer got the light of the day, it shut off well too. I needed this because I ran out of wire, so this extra makes me able to finalize my setup. I have had no issues so far, and it fits in my connectors just fine. My lights at the end of my strand are just as bright as the ones at the beginning. I like it. It works for me!

The 30ft length wasn't long enough for my application so I had to buy another roll locally, which was 16/2 and had the 2 wires stuck together like speaker wires would be. I found this wire much easier to work with. 18g is plenty big enough for a string of LED lights, so the 16 was unnecessary. The outer jacket was plenty easy to strip off the wires, and the insulation on the wires themselves was easy to strip. as for soldering all the wires together, I found this wire much easier to work with than the 16g, and the insulation was small enough that the shrink tubing would also shrink over the small gauge wire that was attached to the lights themselves. The wire is also nice and flexible, which made it easy to bury. I only had a standard shovel for the trench, so it had to follow a path that looked kind of like this ~~~~.

The wire is encased in a flexible PVC jacket that not only makes it durable but also ensures it is waterproof, oil-proof, and UV-resistant. This is a crucial aspect for outdoor installations, providing peace of mind that the wire can withstand various weather conditions without compromising its integrity. The 18-gauge thickness is perfect for low voltage applications, such as LED lighting and automotive speakers.

Additionally, the direct burial capability is a notable advantage, eliminating the need for conduit in certain situations. I found the cable easy to strip and terminate, making the installation process straightforward. The overall build quality instills confidence in its longevity, and I appreciate the attention to detail in its design. In summary, the 18 Gauge Electrical Wire has proven to be a reliable and durable solution for outdoor lighting projects.

There are also waterproof caps on the three plugs in case you are not using them all. I also love the 8 foot extensions after the split so I don't need to get short cords to reach various warmers! They say it is rated to 13 AMPS, which would be like running a 1500W heater or microwave. Most of what I saw online says this is pushing the limits for 16 AWG wire.

This extension cord consolidates 3 separate extension cords plus the splitter into one unit. While not my expertise, the cord appears to be made out of heavy-duty material. Each plug has an attached cover to keep moisture out of the plug when not in use (e.g., when you are only using 2 out of 3 plugs). The light on each plug lets you know it has power. Its long length makes it convenient for outdoor use when your electrical items (in my case, Christmas inflatables and lights) are a distance from the outlet. The splitter is about 7 feet from the end of the cord, so the 3 items you plug in need to be within 14 feet of each other (7 feet one direction, 7 feet the other direction). I was originally going to rate this 4 out of 5 stars because I needed a bit more than those 14 feet, but, in retrospect, 14 feet is pretty generous."

        "<b>Versatile multi-purpose cable for Apple, Android and PC devices</b> Note: This item was sent as part of the Vines review program at no charge. However this review is unbiased and based solely on my experience with the product as received. Upon receiving the cable, I examined the box it came in. On the front of the box it is described as being 1500 mm in length. On the rear of the box, it is described as being 2000 mm in length, as shown in the included images. I measured the cable using a tape measure and the cable is indeed 1500 mm or 1.5 meters in length, not including the extra tips on each end. The cable is a solidly constructed green cable with black and clear color plastic on either end of the cable. It is essentially a USB-C to USB-C power and data cable with a USB-A extension on one end and an Apple compatible Lightning connector on the other. The box also contains a string pouch to store and protect the cable, a nice touch in my opinion. I tested the cable with a Pixel 7, an iPad Mini 4, a MacBook Air M1 and a PC running Windows 11. Data file transfers were flawless and fast. A 200 MB pdf file transferred from PC to Android in about 10 seconds. The iPad connected and synced with the MacBook air flawlessly. I also tested charging using a 65 watt USB C charger. The Pixel reported fast charging when connected. The iPad charged successfully. The photos in the review were uploaded to a PC using the USB A connector to a USB hub. Mechanically the cable worked as advertised. I intend to use this cable extensively since it is so versatile. My only concerns were I wonder how sturdily the Lightning and USB tips are attached and I noticed that the Lighting adapter didn't fit as snugly as the other tips did. I also would be hesitant to order this if I was using thick cases for my equipment due to the large size of the cable adapter ends. They might have difficulty fitting if the port opening on the case was too narrow. I did not experience any issues and recommend this cable for anyone currently carrying around a multitude of different cables to connect various tech items. Data transfer and charging both worked well and this will be part of my EDC going forward.",
        "<b>Strong cable and stiff but in a good way!</b> I like this cable. It is stiff but that's a good thing as you don't want it too weak. It makes it sort of nice where you can bend it to a form you like and stays in that shape. Don't have anything that produces 240W but handles 100W just fine. Data transfer is also fast so it's a great cable to replace any charging and data USB C cable you might need. Recommend this highly!",
        "<b>Great Quality Cable</b> This cable is well made and tough. The charging speed is plenty fast enough for a laptop or tablet. As for the speed of it I don’t have anything fast enough to test its full speed but it does hold up to a 10 Gbps SSD adapter that I have.",
        "<b>Tested to 10GBps in crystal disk mark and Tested using DP over usb C and all working correctly.</b> I got this as I needed a USB-C cable that could do DP over USB-C and this one is the only other cable besides a thunderbolt 3 cable that worked. The first image provided is my computer using a USB 3.2 gen 2 type A port with the included cable plugged into a Samsung T7 touch external SSD. The second image is using this USB-4 cable through a 10GBps USB-C port connected directly to my computer. This cable is excellent at what I've used it for and gets my seal of approval. It's decently long, provides at least 65W of fast charging to my laptop (I could not test higher wattage because my laptop can't handle it.) And it's a super well built cable, it's sturdy and thick as well as having metal USB-C enclosures.",
        "<b>Great cable</b> Works great! I typically receive \"lower charging power\" message on my laptop when I use other cables. This cable fully delivers full power to my LG Gram, and I haven't had single warning message since. Works great as Thunderbolt data cable, too. Super fast data delivery on SanDisk SSD hard drive. Excellent value and highly recommend.",
        "<b>They work well for charging and data!</b> With more and more of my laptops having USB-C only, I needed a couple wires for wired syncing and charging of my iPhone. I have used it both to charge my phone with a charger as well as used it to sync my phone with iTunes. It has worked well in both situations. The cables feel sturdy with a good tight weave. The ends seem well built and have rubber tension relief which is always good. Can't really complain about anything. They work like they are supposed to!",
        "<b>Nice Quality Thunderbolt 4 cable</b> This is a nicely built Thunderbolt 4 cable, it has nice feeling solid connections with a braided cable. Would recommend this cable for high bandwidth data needs or higher power needs over USB-C",
        "<b>Very close to perfect, but makes a huge blunder with fast charging</b> This product has a lot of positive qualities, but makes one huge mistake when it comes to Power Delivery. It only has the e-marker readable from one end of the cable, the one with the type-A adapter attached. Since the power supply needs to read the e-marker to deliver 100W, you'll only get that if you connect this end to your charger. If you flip it around, you'll only get 60W. The USB-IF states the e-marker should be readable from both ends. That's a very, VERY strange thing to mess up, not something I've seen before. I even tried a second example, which showed the same problem. It's a shame, because otherwise these are great cables. For example, the outer jacket is very flexible and soft silicone, and the ends of the cable are very tough feeling. The shrouds and adapters are a bit bulky, though, and might cause clearance issues with some phone cases or neighboring cables. The clear acrylic does look cool, though. Thankfully, there are no silly LEDs inside. Speaking of said adapters, they're both made properly. The type-A one has the proper 56k pullup. The Lightning adapter has the proper 5.1k pulldown, and also allows USB PD negotiation for those iPhones which support it (8-13.) This cable supports data speeds of 480Mbit/s (USB 2.0), exactly as listed. Power-wise, resistance for VBUS and ground is around 165 milliohms, on the good side of average for a 100W cable of this length. Under an hour-long 100W (20V 5A) stress test, the cable became only the slightest bit warm. The cable carries no USB-IF certification, but it also isn't sold as being certified. Given the e-marker situation, it wouldn't pass anyway. Accessories included are a color-matched velcro cable tie, and a velour drawstring bag. Both are of great quality. I'm rather disappointed by this cable. It's built very well, and does almost everything right. I just can't really recommend it with the e-marker issue mentioned above. For the price, the cable should be able to fast charge in both directions. Such a shame.",
        "<b>Quality</b> Excellent quality, 240W super power cable. It's a nylon-braided cord, which is pretty stiff. It's also very thick and strong. It's a USB4 cord compatible with USB-C. I ordered this cord because the 3-foot length is perfect for me and delivers a super-fast charge to my Samsung phone. It is advertised as being capable of 40Gbps fast data transfer and 8K crystal-clear UHD display. At the moment, my laptop is not working, but I can't wait to try this cord with my laptop once it's fixed. I think the price is very reasonable for a future-proof cable."

No more juggling multiple cables for different devices; this one does it all.

And with the extra iPhone cords organizer included, I can keep my workspace tidy and cables tangle-free. What truly sets this cable apart is the lifetime quality assurance offered by Hunda. They stand behind their product wholeheartedly, offering hassle-free replacements for any quality issues, for life. It's a testament to their confidence in the durability and reliability of their product. Overall, this fast-charging cable has exceeded my expectations in every way.

        "<b>Versatile multi-purpose cable for Apple, Android and PC devices</b> Note: This item was sent as part of the Vines review program at no charge. However this review is unbiased and based solely on my experience with the product as received. Upon receiving the cable, I examined the box it came in. On the front of the box it is described as being 1500 mm in length. On the rear of the box, it is described as being 2000 mm in length, as shown in the included images. I measured the cable using a tape measure and the cable is indeed 1500 mm or 1.5 meters in length, not including the extra tips on each end. The cable is a solidly constructed green cable with black and clear color plastic on either end of the cable. It is essentially a USB-C to USB-C power and data cable with a USB-A extension on one end and an Apple compatible Lightning connector on the other. The box also contains a string pouch to store and protect the cable, a nice touch in my opinion. I tested the cable with a Pixel 7, an iPad Mini 4, a MacBook Air M1 and a PC running Windows 11. Data file transfers were flawless and fast. A 200 MB pdf file transferred from PC to Android in about 10 seconds. The iPad connected and synced with the MacBook air flawlessly. I also tested charging using a 65 watt USB C charger. The Pixel reported fast charging when connected. The iPad charged successfully. The photos in the review were uploaded to a PC using the USB A connector to a USB hub. Mechanically the cable worked as advertised. I intend to use this cable extensively since it is so versatile. My only concerns were I wonder how sturdily the Lightning and USB tips are attached and I noticed that the Lighting adapter didn't fit as snugly as the other tips did. I also would be hesitant to order this if I was using thick cases for my equipment due to the large size of the cable adapter ends. They might have difficulty fitting if the port opening on the case was too narrow. I did not experience any issues and recommend this cable for anyone currently carrying around a multitude of different cables to connect various tech items. Data transfer and charging both worked well and this will be part of my EDC going forward."

The long overall length of the cord allows you to reach out to far away electrical devices and then the branches allow you to run a sealed extension of the same cord to other devices. I was previously running multiple cords across the wet lawn to power up all my decorations. This cord is only 16 gauge wire, so it is limited to 13 amps. This isn't an issue when all you are doing is powering yard decorations or lighting, but be aware that it is not suitable for running power tools or higher amperage devices. The female ends have LED lighting for ease of confirming there is power to the cord ends. They also supply \"caps\" for the female ends that are meant to keep out dust/dirt but would not be considered watertight. I am looking forward to next year when I can put all my decorations out and only run a single extension cord!! Definitely worth a look.",

These would be great for holiday lights. At the moment I am using it my workshop where I have a table saw, a drill press, and a grinder all easily able to share one outlet.

The cord I got is 75 feet long, and then splits off into three separate 8 foot sections, each with a glowing outlet and seal at the end. The fact that they glow is so convenient for finding the end in the grass. The seal on the end means that you don't have to actually utilize all three of the ends for it to be weather protected. While I might not try to power three high-amp devices at the same time with this, that should be a given, as it only plugs into one, presumably 15 amp, outlet. I highly recommend this indoor/outdoor extension cord!",

Evidently counterfeit chips were used on some v4.2.2 boards and aren't compatible, or something to that effect. If it glitches, you will need to decide if you want to revert to original firmware and return it since the device isn't installed yet or press on with trying custom firmware! Install is a bit of a pain. I routed the ribbon through the loom to keep it nice looking. Then you have to take some tape loose and feed it on through and connect to the board. Once that's all good, you will need to install firmware if you didn't previously do that as I mentioned first. I installed mine, updated firmware, then had the screen all glitched out with the Creality Touch firmware. I freaked out!! I researched a ton and eventually started building my own firmware and had to use the 256k configuration even though the chip on my v4.2.2 board was supposed to be the 512k version. I later upgraded to a v4.2.7 board. Get your bed manually leveled to the best of your ability and the auto leveling will work to mitigate small variations. It's really neat to put something small on the Z rod and watch it as corrections are made as the nozzle goes across the bed. It's a nice upgrade and I've been happy with it.",

        "<b>Be careful where you get the firmware upgrade from</b> I installed this on my Ender 5 Pro. I had some issues with the mounting bracket for the probe. There was interference from the screw tab on the cooling fan shroud and also the X-axis belt end. A little bit of grinding with a Dremel solved the problem. I downloaded and installed new firmware from Creality.com and I believe this was a mistake. First, my extruder ran backward, and I had to swap two wires to make it run the correct direction. The next problem was the height at which the probe tripped was causing my nozzle to press into the bed. I solved this by removing the probe from the bracket and shimming it down a little with several washers. That corrected the probing height problem. I tried several prints, and the quality was horrible. It seemed like an under-extrusion issue, so I attempted to calibrate my extruder. At this time my extruder quit working all together. I tried plugging my Y-axis cable into the extruder to see if it would move or not. It did not move so I assumed that the motor went bad. I ordered a new motor and hooked it up and still nothing. I hooked up the cable from my extruder to the Y-axis motor and it moved just fine so I knew there was no problem with the mainboard. So, I disconnected the probe and decided to go back to the original firmware. I went back to creality.com to get the firmware and I could only find a version in the Czech language. WTH?? So, I did some more searching and found Creality3dofficial.com. I went there and downloaded the original firmware and installed it. Everything worked as it should. Since that worked, I decided to download and install the touch probe firmware from that site, and everything works as it should. Great."

        "<b>Creality CR Touch Auto Leveling Kit: A Game-Changer for 3D Printing</b> I recently upgraded my Ender 3 V2 with the Creality Official CR Touch Auto Leveling Kit, and it's been nothing short of transformative, earning a well-deserved 5-star rating. This kit has significantly enhanced my 3D printing experience by automating the bed leveling process, a task that used to require manual effort and precision. The CR Touch sensor is impressively designed, combining simplicity with high precision. Its ability to perform multi-point detection across the printing platform and accurately record the height at each point ensures a perfectly leveled bed every time. The sensor has proven to be incredibly stable and reliable, with a long service life that Creality claims can be reused more than 100,000 times. One of the standout features of this kit is its strong compatibility. It works seamlessly with a variety of bed materials—whether it's PEI, sticker, glass, or metal—making it a versatile choice for different printing preferences. This broad compatibility ensures that the CR Touch can be integrated into a wide range of printing setups without any issues. Installation was a breeze, which is a huge plus. The process of downloading the CR Touch program from Creality's official website and updating the printer's firmware via a TF/SD card is straightforward and user-friendly. There's no need for an ISP burner, making the setup process accessible even to those who are less tech-savvy. Additionally, the quality of the components, especially the metal tip of the sensor, is top-notch. It feels durable and well-made, contributing to the overall reliability and performance of the auto-leveling system. Compatibility with both Klipper and Marlin firmware is another advantage. This flexibility allows users to choose their preferred firmware based on their specific needs and preferences, enhancing the usability of the CR Touch across different software ecosystems. In summary, the Creality Official CR Touch Auto Leveling Kit is a fantastic investment for any 3D printer user looking to simplify their printing process. It's especially beneficial for those with Ender 3 series or CR-10 printers equipped with a 32 Bit V4.2.2 / V4.2.7 Mainboard. The ease of installation, high-quality components, and compatibility with multiple firmware options make it a standout product in the realm of 3D printing accessories. Whether you're a hobbyist or a more experienced user, the CR Touch is sure to make your 3D printing experience more enjoyable and efficient.",
        "<b>I wish I had done that sooner!</b> I installed this on my Ender 3 V2... but I have upgraded my printer with a Sprite Pro direct drive extruder. There was an built in mounting location on my extruder (didn't need any brackets although it comes with several) and I was able to plug it into my machine with the supplied short (5cm?) cable right into the connector on the extruder. I am running an awesome firmware (MriscoC) on my machine. With the upgraded extruder I had to follow a procedure to set all of the required values (to make the printer use the entire bed) but with the 9x9 grid of bed measurements I can now print large flat objects right through the warp/dip at the center of my bed! I can finally start my printer and walk away without worrying that it won't work!",
        "<b>It’s a must have</b> Manual bed leveling is so time consuming and you’ll never get it as good as an auto level will. You still have to level manually within reason but after you use the cr-touch it’s perfect.",
        "<b>If you are still rubbing paper under your nozzle---BUY THIS</b> I got very tired of leveling my bed manually every time I printed something. Then it was subject to a good job or a questionable or a crappy job. This takes the human variable out of setting up your bed leveling. I think we can all agree this is a much better method for consistency...",
        "<b>Game Changer</b> This is a must for getting a even level print. I would spend 20+ minutes each print trying to ensure the most level print bed, only to get 2 or 3 layers into the print and find significant warping. Now, it takes just minutes to get printing. Came with the correct mount for my Ender 3 Max. Few issues installing the firmware, and offset height, but once you understand the correlation of each setting it’s only second nature. As shown in the picture thin full bed prints are an ease.",
        "<b>The single best upgrade to an Ender 3v2 printer (other than the all metal extruder)</b> This along with the silicone bed mounts makes for almost no manual adjustments. (you still need to get your machine close to level) A must have upgrade in my opinion.",
        "<b>Good Value</b> After recompiling Marlin 2.0 for my Ender 3 with a 4.2.7 board, I used this for bed leveling. It works really well, much better the BL Touch that I used initially.",
        "<b>Huge Time Saver</b> Purchased for my ender 3 pro. The stock ender 3 is unbalanced on the Z-axis, so if you bump the x-axis you need to re-level, really annoying. The z-limit switch also has to be low enough to let your nozzle touch the build-plate but if its too low your nozzle will press into the build-pate when zeroing. This probe will touch off on the bed, create a mesh, and adjust the print for a tilted bed, super convenient and consistent z-height every time. No z-switch to mess with, just change your G28 to G29 and you're good to go.",
        "<b>Decent upgrade to account for slight variances on bed.</b> NOTE: Try installing the touch firmware FIRST and see if your screen glitches. Evidently counterfeit chips were used on some v4.2.2 boards and aren't compatible, or something to that effect. If it glitches, you will need to decide if you want to revert to original firmware and return it since the device isn't installed yet or press on with trying custom firmware! Install is a bit of a pain. I routed the ribbon through the loom to keep it nice looking. Then you have to take some tape loose and feed it on through and connect to the board. Once that's all good, you will need to install firmware if you didn't previously do that as I mentioned first. I installed mine, updated firmware, then had the screen all glitched out with the Creality Touch firmware. I freaked out!! I researched a ton and eventually started building my own firmware and had to use the 256k configuration even though the chip on my v4.2.2 board was supposed to be the 512k version. I later upgraded to a v4.2.7 board. Get your bed manually leveled to the best of your ability and the auto leveling will work to mitigate small variations. It's really neat to put something small on the Z rod and watch it as corrections are made as the nozzle goes across the bed. It's a nice upgrade and I've been happy with it.",
        "<b>It fixed all problems I had with leveling my bed.</b> I'm no longer using the printer I bought this for, but for the very short time I got to use the CR-touch, it was fantastic. It had some inconsistencies because I had to hand-solder a cable (and print a bracket) for my obscure creality printer, but when it worked it worked perfectly. This + Klipper is the dream setup",
        "<b>No more leveling issues</b> I had to upgrade Marlin firmware and do some configuration but it works like a charm every single time! No more manual leveling!",
        "<b>Very easy to install and ABL Mesh is good</b> Installation process is easy with included brackets or on a sprite DD extruder.",
        "<b>Game changer!</b> It was a bit of a pain to find the correct firmware for my old first generation ender 3, but this is amazing. I now have perfect bed adhesion, and no longer have to use glue to keep my parts from lifting up."

The only slight downfall is that the input will occasionally disconnect when switching from 120 to 60 fps (Has never happened mid game).

ISSUE: After 5 minutes of gameplay, I will lose picture from the Xbox and the monitor will say \"NO SIGNAL\". SOLUTION: Disconnecting the HDMI port from the Xbox and replugging it back in will bring the picture back. This will occur 2-3 times before it maintains the picture for the duration of gameplay. SETTINGS: I have attempted all types of settings on the Xbox and on my monitor to see if I can get this issue to stop. It occurs at 120 & 60 frames a second, all color spacings and in manual or automatic display detection. NOTE: Disconnecting the USB power does not cause the monitor to lose signal, I am curious if I might have a defective product. I have also attempted to plug the USB into another power supply in case the Xbox was somehow interrupting power. FINAL THOUGHTS: With putting wear and tear on my connector having to disconnect and re-plug in as well as the interruption it causes during gameplay It might just be better to stick with 60 frames a second using the HDMI. Not all games support 120 at this point anyways so you're not gaining much.

In some cases, even if you can get the cable end to fit into the device, it doesn't have a 'good insertion' feel to it where the cable will stay in without purposeful intervention. i.e. the cable can be inserted and charge the device but it easily falls out if the cable is jiggled around."

This would also be a good interconnect for high power HF use, where losses are so small as to be negligible. That’s assuming the cable meets LMR-400 specs. LMR-400 is a trademark of Times Microwave. Other companies making equivalent cable give it other names, like “ABC-400.” I asked if this was actual Times Microwave cable, and got a somewhat equivocal answer, so I suspect it is not.

This optical cable should obviously be running where it won't be stepped on or damaged (since optical cables are fairly fragile by nature). The sound clarity is the high quality you should expect from optical. I will say that I wouldn't go any longer than 25 feet for an optical cable due to the potential for signal degradation, and if a shorter cable will do, I would go that route for the same reason.

On top of that it is extremely well made, the coating seems very high quality, and it is the only charging cable I have that comes with a nice bag and the way the connector ends are attached is far superior to that of other multi-purpose connectors I've seen. The ends are on large, very well made hinge-like pieces that allow you to change one end from Lightening to USB-C and the other from USB-C to USB-A. So, your options are: USB-A to Lightening USB-C to Lightening USB-A to USB-C USB-C to USB-C With the changeover from Lightning to USB-C among Apple devices and most other devices moving to USB-C but the presence of so many USB-A chargers still out there a cable like this is very handy for Apple users who still have products with Lightning connectors. You're covered now and in the future with this cable and you can charge your friends' newer Apple or Andriod products too. I didn't have any trouble getting the Lighting connector to fit my iPhone and iPad while both were in their cases but I understand that this isn't true for everyone. My iPhone case is not an Otterbox nor is my iPad case though the iPad case is a very thick, protective case, it just has a large cutout for the charger.

The cable is very flexible and does not tangle, in part because it is a little thicker than the standard cable. The cable is also very lightweight. Other cables of this thickness tend to be heavier. The flexibility with the ends is what drew me to this cable. One end is USB A tor USB C. The other end is USB C or Lightning (Apple). What makes this cable different different is that the adaptors to change from A to C one one end or C to Lightning on the other have a metal structure that allows one adapter to be pulled up and folded back and out of the way to provide access to the other adapter. Unlike other brands, this mechanism is metal, very precise and very durable. It is a neat looking device. My only wish is that when the adapter is folded back, it clicks into place so it doesn't flop around. Overall... this cable provides the adapters I was looking for, is well designed, and have a really cool, lightweight cable housing."

        "<b>Reliable and Durable Outdoor Wiring Solution</b> One of the standout features is its robust construction. The wire is encased in a flexible PVC jacket that not only makes it durable but also ensures it is waterproof, oil-proof, and UV-resistant. This is a crucial aspect for outdoor installations, providing peace of mind that the wire can withstand various weather conditions without compromising its integrity. The 18-gauge thickness is perfect for low voltage applications, such as LED lighting and automotive speakers. The stranded design adds flexibility, making it easy to work with and allowing for smooth installations even in tight spaces. Additionally, the direct burial capability is a notable advantage, eliminating the need for conduit in certain situations. I found the cable easy to strip and terminate, making the installation process straightforward. The overall build quality instills confidence in its longevity, and I appreciate the attention to detail in its design. In summary, the 18 Gauge Electrical Wire has proven to be a reliable and durable solution for outdoor lighting projects. Its waterproof and UV-resistant properties, combined with the flexibility of the stranded design, make it an ideal choice for anyone seeking a high-quality cable for low voltage landscape lighting and other outdoor applications.",

The 30ft length wasn't long enough for my application so I had to buy another roll locally, which was 16/2 and had the 2 wires stuck together like speaker wires would be. I found this wire much easier to work with. 18g is plenty big enough for a string of LED lights, so the 16 was unnecessary. The outer jacket was plenty easy to strip off the wires, and the insulation on the wires themselves was easy to strip. as for soldering all the wires together, I found this wire much easier to work with than the 16g, and the insulation was small enough that the shrink tubing would also shrink over the small gauge wire that was attached to the lights themselves. The wire is also nice and flexible, which made it easy to bury. I only had a standard shovel for the trench, so it had to follow a path that looked kind of like this ~~~~. I very much preferred working with this wire compared to the 16g, which is the opposite of what I expected when I started the project.",

The rubberized insulation of the cable allows for a really easy, almost effortless bend to the cable. Similarly the end connectors are easy to flip/switch out from Lightning to USB-C on one end and from USB-A to USB-C on the other. The mechanism has a good 'quality' feel to it and I get a good feeling that it will last for years. Small details that hurt the product are that the end connectors' housings are quite thick. This makes it hard to insert and secure it into iPhones with a case, or other devices that only have small areas to which to insert the cable into. In some cases, even if you can get the cable end to fit into the device, it doesn't have a 'good insertion' feel to it where the cable will stay in without purposeful intervention. i.e. the cable can be inserted and charge the device but it easily falls out if the cable is jiggled around."

Because it is water and oil resistant, the jacket should last a very long time against whatever gets flung onto it.

I found it easy to work with as well (but I also have excellent tools in my kit to work with.) The quality definitely meets my standards. Since I just started using this wire, I should say that I'm not sure how it'll hold up over the long-term. But upon just getting started with it, so far so good. Here are the factors about this wire that were most important to me. The wire is UL2464 compliant, meaning it meets strict quality standards. 9 strands of 0.254mm tinned copper wire, so it's got great conductivity. PVC Jacket seems thick and sturdy - making it durable. It also claims to be flame resistant, though I haven't personally checked that claim. All in all, I'm happy with the wire and feel it was a good choice. I would consider getting it again.",
        "<b>Very close to perfect, but makes a huge blunder with fast charging</b> This product has a lot of positive qualities, but makes one huge mistake when it comes to Power Delivery. It only has the e-marker readable from one end of the cable, the one with the type-A adapter attached. Since the power supply needs to read the e-marker to deliver 100W, you'll only get that if you connect this end to your charger. If you flip it around, you'll only get 60W. The USB-IF states the e-marker should be readable from both ends. That's a very, VERY strange thing to mess up, not something I've seen before. I even tried a second example, which showed the same problem. It's a shame, because otherwise these are great cables. For example, the outer jacket is very flexible and soft silicone, and the ends of the cable are very tough feeling. The shrouds and adapters are a bit bulky, though, and might cause clearance issues with some phone cases or neighboring cables. The clear acrylic does look cool, though. Thankfully, there are no silly LEDs inside. Speaking of said adapters, they're both made properly. The type-A one has the proper 56k pullup. The Lightning adapter has the proper 5.1k pulldown, and also allows USB PD negotiation for those iPhones which support it (8-13.) This cable supports data speeds of 480Mbit/s (USB 2.0), exactly as listed. Power-wise, resistance for VBUS and ground is around 165 milliohms, on the good side of average for a 100W cable of this length. Under an hour-long 100W (20V 5A) stress test, the cable became only the slightest bit warm. The cable carries no USB-IF certification, but it also isn't sold as being certified. Given the e-marker situation, it wouldn't pass anyway. Accessories included are a color-matched velcro cable tie, and a velour drawstring bag. Both are of great quality. I'm rather disappointed by this cable. It's built very well, and does almost everything right. I just can't really recommend it with the e-marker issue mentioned above. For the price, the cable should be able to fast charge in both directions. Such a shame."

However, this is good line for all weather outdoor use. On/in/under a vehicle, and is going to handle friction and stretching well. It is UL2464 Complaint, which means in a nutshell: It’s certified safe as an “external interconnect cable”. AKA: You’re alright using this outside; even burying it underground. The wire jackets/sheathing itself are robust and flexible as with the primary jacket/sheath. It also has a good bit of copper (tin also) in its makeup. This on paper and upon observation this is very good wire. I wouldn’t use it to jump a car battery, or wire up a competition car audio system (been there, done that, and was a garage manager) but low power on/off applications in all weather environments, you’re going to be just fine. I only wish I could have gotten a larger roll. I’d recommend it. Seems better than the line contractors installed underground for our underground sprinkler system.",

This kit has significantly enhanced my 3D printing experience by automating the bed leveling process, a task that used to require manual effort and precision. The CR Touch sensor is impressively designed, combining simplicity with high precision. Its ability to perform multi-point detection across the printing platform and accurately record the height at each point ensures a perfectly leveled bed every time. The sensor has proven to be incredibly stable and reliable, with a long service life that Creality claims can be reused more than 100,000 times. One of the standout features of this kit is its strong compatibility. It works seamlessly with a variety of bed materials—whether it's PEI, sticker, glass, or metal—making it a versatile choice for different printing preferences. This broad compatibility ensures that the CR Touch can be integrated into a wide range of printing setups without any issues. Installation was a breeze, which is a huge plus. The process of downloading the CR Touch program from Creality's official website and updating the printer's firmware via a TF/SD card is straightforward and user-friendly. There's no need for an ISP burner, making the setup process accessible even to those who are less tech-savvy. Additionally, the quality of the components, especially the metal tip of the sensor, is top-notch. It feels durable and well-made, contributing to the overall reliability and performance of the auto-leveling system. Compatibility with both Klipper and Marlin firmware is another advantage. This flexibility allows users to choose their preferred firmware based on their specific needs and preferences, enhancing the usability of the CR Touch across different software ecosystems. In summary, the Creality Official CR Touch Auto Leveling Kit is a fantastic investment for any 3D printer user looking to simplify their printing process. It's especially beneficial for those with Ender 3 series or CR-10 printers equipped with a 32 Bit V4.2.2 / V4.2.7 Mainboard. The ease of installation, high-quality components, and compatibility with multiple firmware options make it a standout product in the realm of 3D printing accessories. Whether you're a hobbyist or a more experienced user, the CR Touch is sure to make your 3D printing experience more enjoyable and efficient.",

        "<b>Very close to perfect, but makes a huge blunder with fast charging</b> This product has a lot of positive qualities, but makes one huge mistake when it comes to Power Delivery. It only has the e-marker readable from one end of the cable, the one with the type-A adapter attached. Since the power supply needs to read the e-marker to deliver 100W, you'll only get that if you connect this end to your charger. If you flip it around, you'll only get 60W. The USB-IF states the e-marker should be readable from both ends. That's a very, VERY strange thing to mess up, not something I've seen before. I even tried a second example, which showed the same problem. It's a shame, because otherwise these are great cables. For example, the outer jacket is very flexible and soft silicone, and the ends of the cable are very tough feeling. The shrouds and adapters are a bit bulky, though, and might cause clearance issues with some phone cases or neighboring cables. The clear acrylic does look cool, though. Thankfully, there are no silly LEDs inside. Speaking of said adapters, they're both made properly. The type-A one has the proper 56k pullup. The Lightning adapter has the proper 5.1k pulldown, and also allows USB PD negotiation for those iPhones which support it (8-13.) This cable supports data speeds of 480Mbit/s (USB 2.0), exactly as listed. Power-wise, resistance for VBUS and ground is around 165 milliohms, on the good side of average for a 100W cable of this length. Under an hour-long 100W (20V 5A) stress test, the cable became only the slightest bit warm. The cable carries no USB-IF certification, but it also isn't sold as being certified. Given the e-marker situation, it wouldn't pass anyway. Accessories included are a color-matched velcro cable tie, and a velour drawstring bag. Both are of great quality. I'm rather disappointed by this cable. It's built very well, and does almost everything right. I just can't really recommend it with the e-marker issue mentioned above. For the price, the cable should be able to fast charge in both directions. Such a shame."

The first thing I noticed was the quality of the cable as well as the engineering of the adapter ends. The silicone material feels way more sturdy than those cheap, plasticy cables. It has interchangeable adapter ends allows for quick change from USB-C/A to Lightening/USB-C to charge different devices using the same cable. This is a super nice feature as it eliminates at least three cables that I lug around with me in my backpack. They claim faster charging because of the thickened copper core. I don’t know what that means, but It charges my iPhone ridiculously fast – way faster than the standard cable it came with. Even with my bulky phone case, it connects without issue.

This cable is a true multitasker, combining four ports - USB A to C, USB A to Lightning, USB C to Lightning, and USB C to USB C - all in one sleek design. No more juggling multiple cables for different devices; this one does it all. The build quality is top-notch, with a high-purity thickened copper core that ensures ultra-fast charging and data transfer speeds. Plus, the silicone construction makes it 50 times more durable than regular cables, meaning it's built to last. I love the thoughtful design details, like the aluminum alloy shell that adds durability and the transparent PC shell that gives it a futuristic look. And with the extra iPhone cords organizer included, I can keep my workspace tidy and cables tangle-free. What truly sets this cable apart is the lifetime quality assurance offered by Hunda. They stand behind their product wholeheartedly, offering hassle-free replacements for any quality issues, for life. It's a testament to their confidence in the durability and reliability of their product. Overall, this fast-charging cable has exceeded my expectations in every way.

        "<b>Very close to perfect, but makes a huge blunder with fast charging</b> This product has a lot of positive qualities, but makes one huge mistake when it comes to Power Delivery. It only has the e-marker readable from one end of the cable, the one with the type-A adapter attached. Since the power supply needs to read the e-marker to deliver 100W, you'll only get that if you connect this end to your charger. If you flip it around, you'll only get 60W. The USB-IF states the e-marker should be readable from both ends. That's a very, VERY strange thing to mess up, not something I've seen before. I even tried a second example, which showed the same problem. It's a shame, because otherwise these are great cables. For example, the outer jacket is very flexible and soft silicone, and the ends of the cable are very tough feeling. The shrouds and adapters are a bit bulky, though, and might cause clearance issues with some phone cases or neighboring cables. The clear acrylic does look cool, though. Thankfully, there are no silly LEDs inside. Speaking of said adapters, they're both made properly. The type-A one has the proper 56k pullup. The Lightning adapter has the proper 5.1k pulldown, and also allows USB PD negotiation for those iPhones which support it (8-13.) This cable supports data speeds of 480Mbit/s (USB 2.0), exactly as listed. Power-wise, resistance for VBUS and ground is around 165 milliohms, on the good side of average for a 100W cable of this length. Under an hour-long 100W (20V 5A) stress test, the cable became only the slightest bit warm. The cable carries no USB-IF certification, but it also isn't sold as being certified. Given the e-marker situation, it wouldn't pass anyway. Accessories included are a color-matched velcro cable tie, and a velour drawstring bag. Both are of great quality. I'm rather disappointed by this cable. It's built very well, and does almost everything right. I just can't really recommend it with the e-marker issue mentioned above. For the price, the cable should be able to fast charge in both directions. Such a shame."

You essentially have multiple cables all in one product, which is great for reducing clutter from a million cables. It’s also fast and I can confirm it is truly a fast charging cable as it claims. Most other cables I bought also claimed that, but this one actually lived up to the claim. I use it with a 100w PD fast charging brick and it charges my iPhone 14PM around 60-65% in an hour, or roughly 1% a minute. That’s three times as fast as the stock cable. Aside from the speed, practicality, and value, it also looks cool. I love the color and switching between the different heads is as easy as pulling it to the side and down across the hinge. I don’t know how durable it is, but it looks like a pretty solid construction. It does come with a small bag too in case you want to store it after use. Easily a 5/5.",

I connected it to my Apple SE second edition, and connected it to a makerfire (USB Tester Voltage Power Meter) then to a 20w PD Charger. The makerfire was reading it was Charing the phone at ~ 10w (when the phone battery was at 30%). As other reviewer(s) have said, the cable is NOT 6' it is about 1\"-2\" shorter. Yes, 1\"-2\" shorter is not much of a difference, but it's the point (1 star less).",

With this, I can put my Apple cable back in my desk drawer and charge both of my phones, my tablet, and my laptop without ever needing another cable. I'm surprised this works at 5A, but since it does, I can charge my Samsung at 45W and my laptop at full 100W by just flipping the cable ends off to the side. While I am a bit worried the cable could get broken when the ends are opened, I think it's still a fine cable that solves my problems. I've used it for about a week with no durability issues, and it even comes with a velcro strap that matches the cable's color (green in my case) and a cloth bag to keep the cable in. This is really a 10/10 product that is so underrated, since I own 2 phones, a tablet, and a USB-C capable laptop, and this cable can substitute for all of them. Buy one, if not two, since these will solve all your connector problems. These cables also have data pins. While it's not thunderbolt 4, the data pins in these cables can transfer your photos and other important files, so you don't even need to worry about getting a separate cable for that! This is a really well-thought-out product that deserves more recognition on the Amazon marketplace.",
        "<b>not soft</b> I don't have professional testing tools, so I can't test its performance. Can it reach 240w? Support 8K display 40Gbps data?

But the result was stiff, not soft at all. Compared with Apple's own type-c cable with data transmission, it is half the price.

I also have a few apple peripherals like the trackpad, as well as a handful of batteries that take lightning so this cable is very useful.

        "<b>Why buy three extension cords when one works</b> We recently had a very cold weather system come in and I used up every extension cord I had to keep the chicken coop warm and the waterers from freezing. Now with this cord I freed up my old cords and do the job with just one now! I like how the three ends are lighted when the power is on. I have a GFI that sometimes trips so instead of going up to the outlet to see the tiny green light I can just look at the plugs. There are also waterproof caps on the three plugs in case you are not using them all. I also love the 8 foot extensions after the split so I don't need to get short cords to reach various warmers! They say it is rated to 13 AMPS, which would be like running a 1500W heater or microwave. Most of what I saw online says this is pushing the limits for 16 AWG wire. One site said this would work for a 50 foot cord, but not a 75 foot one. Also nowhere on the box or the cord could I find where it was made. Likely China, but it is strange not to say so."

        "<b>Very close to perfect, but makes a huge blunder with fast charging</b> This product has a lot of positive qualities, but makes one huge mistake when it comes to Power Delivery. It only has the e-marker readable from one end of the cable, the one with the type-A adapter attached. Since the power supply needs to read the e-marker to deliver 100W, you'll only get that if you connect this end to your charger. If you flip it around, you'll only get 60W. The USB-IF states the e-marker should be readable from both ends. That's a very, VERY strange thing to mess up, not something I've seen before. I even tried a second example, which showed the same problem. It's a shame, because otherwise these are great cables. For example, the outer jacket is very flexible and soft silicone, and the ends of the cable are very tough feeling. The shrouds and adapters are a bit bulky, though, and might cause clearance issues with some phone cases or neighboring cables. The clear acrylic does look cool, though. Thankfully, there are no silly LEDs inside. Speaking of said adapters, they're both made properly. The type-A one has the proper 56k pullup. The Lightning adapter has the proper 5.1k pulldown, and also allows USB PD negotiation for those iPhones which support it (8-13.) This cable supports data speeds of 480Mbit/s (USB 2.0), exactly as listed. Power-wise, resistance for VBUS and ground is around 165 milliohms, on the good side of average for a 100W cable of this length. Under an hour-long 100W (20V 5A) stress test, the cable became only the slightest bit warm. The cable carries no USB-IF certification, but it also isn't sold as being certified. Given the e-marker situation, it wouldn't pass anyway. Accessories included are a color-matched velcro cable tie, and a velour drawstring bag. Both are of great quality. I'm rather disappointed by this cable. It's built very well, and does almost everything right. I just can't really recommend it with the e-marker issue mentioned above. For the price, the cable should be able to fast charge in both directions. Such a shame.",
        "<b>Excellent 18ga cable, thick jacket</b> The outer jacket on this cable is super thick, making it very durable. The thickness of the jacket requires you to put some effort and care into stripping it without nicking the inner conductors’ insulation.

I used this to wire up home security alarm sirens within interior walls / attic space and it was perfect for that application. 5 stars.",

However, the combs I received in the packaging are just standard 12 wire cable design combs (only 12 wire slots) without the additional 4 wire signal comb on the back side (see image). This means the additional 4 signal wires on the cable are left unsecured! The only way to secure them is with wire zip ties which defeats the whole purpose of combed wire cables! This is unacceptable and very disappointing! Maybe I received an incorrectly packaged cable, but I'm hesitant to even exchange these as I don't know that I'll get one with proper combs or not. Also, I can't really take my system offline until I can get a new cable, so I'm stuck with zip tied signal wires, sadly! BUYER BEWARE! (UPDATED, see above, received replacement wire combs from Fasgear at no charge!)",

Apple LED Cinema Display on PC! mDP / DP to HDMI with no issues!</b> I was in need of an adapter that can convert a DisplayPort signal to HDMI for use with my consoles and primarily my PC, as my ASUS GTX 1080 Ti has only 2 DisplayPorts and 2 HDMI’s and have 3 DisplayPort monitors. My config is a Dell 27” G Sync Display, and 2 Apple LED Cinema 27” Displays from 2010 (not thunderbolt). All are 2560x1440p, exception being the Dell can do 144hz and the Apple’s do 60hz. I have verified that even when using mDP extensions, mDP to DP adapters, and various PC’s and consoles that the adapter works flawlessly! No artifacting, no ghosting, no perceivable input lag vs direct connection. HDMI audio supports. It’s a good adapter, much better than no name brands. If you wish to connect an Apple LED Cinema Display, or any DisplayPort monitor to an HDMI device this is it for you. Note: using this adapter doesn’t provide overridden EDID data, and it’s up to the OS to provide support for the resolutions the monitor can handle. The Apple LED Cinema 27 Display only supports 1280x720 and 2560x1440 even on macOS. Using Windows it can support a broad range of resolutions since it’ll scale approximately using whatever GPU driver you have. On consoles it’s not that simple. Nintendo Switch only supports its 720p mode, PS4 / PS4 Pro doesn’t support it at all, and Xbox One consoles support all resolutions. I have no information if this is better on the PS5 / Xbox Series SX consoles. This is not a knock on the adapter but rather informing you this adapter does a raw active pass through without changing EDID data."

I use it in a server rack and having lots of outlets spaced close together means shorter power cable runs for the servers.

I researched a ton and eventually started building my own firmware and had to use the 256k configuration even though the chip on my v4.2.2 board was supposed to be the 512k version. I later upgraded to a v4.2.7 board. Get your bed manually leveled to the best of your ability and the auto leveling will work to mitigate small variations. It's really neat to put something small on the Z rod and watch it as corrections are made as the nozzle goes across the bed. It's a nice upgrade and I've been happy with it.",
        "<b>Not the best for installation</b> The wires are not well secured in it and installation is not easy. Once you strip the speaker wires you have to fan it and let it engage (hook inside out) to the inside opening and twist lock it . During the twisting some of the speaker wires get moved or severed and you will end up having a poor connection. I guess if you have very thick gauzed wire (12 gauze or 10 gauze) you might have a better installation. I ended up buying different banana plugs (the ones that you screw secure the speaker wire) and found them to have better connections.",
        "<b>Can be easy or hard to install depending on what printer you use</b> This works well, spent a week trying to get it hooked up and running on my cr-10 v3, easy enough to install. My only issues were trying to get cr-touch firmware for my printer. It is the exact same concept as the bl-touch so i ended up installing that firmware and its uses the cr- touch with no issues",
        "<b>Just don't</b> These are made for thin gauge speaker wire. Not high quality wire with a decent gauge. These connect by feeding the wire through the end then bend wire back over the screw threads and screw back together. Any decent wire gauge will not fit. Wire will not even fit through the sleeve. BEWARE THIS TOOK WAY TO LONG TO GET MY REFUND BACK FROM THEM."

        "<b>Poor design - they come loose and are hard to install</b> This design isn't good. I installed about 20 of them because I was playing with different speakers and amps, and they by and large all came loose. They're hard to install because they rely on the wire being secured by the same threads that hold the entire plug together, and this comes loose as you handle it. The threads that secure the actual plug to the main body also come loose -- and on top of that, the material isn't sturdy enough so that the plugs change shape, making them sit loosely in the receiving end (the speaker or amp side). I ended up soldering wire in place, which worked for a little while, but not reliably so. This was so bad that you could hear crackle (or silence!) from the bad connection. I ended up replacing them with WGGE plugs, which, for the same price, come with two little bolts that secure the wire (copper + insulation!), and the body is attached independently. That works way better, for the same price."

        "<b>It works, but a little hard to install</b> This works fine. The physical installation was pretty straightforward. But it requires a 32 bit motherboard with a port for it, which I didn't have, requiring me to replace the motherboard. The only real problem was installing the firmware to make the bed leveling sensor work. The instruction manual that came with it had very tiny type that was hard to read, even with a magnifying glass. The website link in the instructions to download the correct firmware did not work. I got help from online chat and got a correct link to the correct firmware. The firmware loaded without trouble. Calibrating the extruder height above the bed was, at first, a little complex and challenging. Perhaps if I could have read the tiny instructions, it would have been easier. After having done it a couple of times now, I understand the reason for the steps in the process and it's pretty simple. All in all, it is a good upgrade to my printer."

Long and very useful I used this with my generator recently to move power from a somewhat noisy (large) generator to the projector, speakers and lights that needed it. It worked perfectly. Solid and sturdy feeling. Nice tight connections. Really just what I needed over a long cord and a surge strip.",

        "<b>Flexible 16/3 extension cord with versatile 3-whip configuration</b> Extension and whip lengths were accurate. The cord itself is flexible (not stiff at all), but that’s expected from 16ga stranded wire. I *love* the 3-whip configuration on this extension cord, which is far more versatile than using a 3-way splitter on the end of a single, standard extension cord. Pros: - Flexible/non-stiff cable makes roll-up/roll-out easy - All cable ends/plugs are lit - Green cord color blends-in with the yard (could be a good thing or a bad thing) - (3) 8ft. whips are perfect for outside work area setups (mitre saw, table saw, drill, etc.) Cons: - None",
        "<b>Solves a major headache</b> The extension cord is heavy duty and can be used outdoors. I like that it I is colored green, so it blends in well with grass. In addition, the lights on each extension allows me to know at a glance whether each extension is working and getting power. This cord would be great for anyone who has a limited number of outlets, but needs to run power to different areas. This would be useful for those displaying outdoor lights or hosting an outdoor party. However, I ordered this cord to help me provide freshwater to my farmyard birds during cold winter weather. I have three bird pens, for my chickens, guinea fowl and peafowl. In the sub zero temperatures we have had lately, I needed water heaters in each pen so that my birds could each have their own ice-free water fountain. This extension cord arrived in time to allow me to run electricity to each pen, before the temperature dropped. The cord has solved a problem, for which my birds and I are grateful. This is a great item. If you need additional outdoor electricity, this may be the product that solves your problem. I highly recommend it.",
        "<b>Genius. Great for outdoor lighting decorations!!</b> Three sockets, spread up to 20' apart - just what those front lawn decorations need!!! The glowing ends let you know if there's really power, which is a great debugging tool. The main trunk cord is good and long, which works for me - I have a L-O-N-G front yard. Price seems OK for such a feature-filled product.",
        "<b>Another brilliant idea</b> This is such a smart idea. I used to have multiple lead cords running all across the deck, and it was just a mess. Now I can run this to 3 separate sections of the deck and have power to all 3 with only one power plug needed."

It's not just a tempting option, but THE option for anyone wanting a single cable to charge multiple devices. It delivers on all its promises, and is definitely worth the investment.",
        "<b>Good Idea, Steep Price</b> I do really like this charger, and being able to switch back and forth to different charging capabilities is a great idea. The attachments stay on well, and it can charge my phone relatively fast. The cord feels high quality as well. However, for a 3 ft charging cord, I find the price to be a bit expensive even with all things considered. Not a bad buy if you’re willing to splurge a little!",
        "<b>versatile.</b> My complaint with this cord is that neither of the type C plugs will fit through my phone case. Since I have other cords that do fit, I will not be using this to charge my phone. The versatility of the changeable plugs, though, does lend itself to many other uses. The other consideration is that the USB A is a standard 2.0. So, while it will fast charge devices, and is able to handle the various wattage of chargers up to 100W, the data transfer speeds will be limited to 480Mbps."

        "<b>Versatile multi-purpose cable for Apple, Android and PC devices</b> Note: This item was sent as part of the Vines review program at no charge. However this review is unbiased and based solely on my experience with the product as received. Upon receiving the cable, I examined the box it came in. On the front of the box it is described as being 1500 mm in length. On the rear of the box, it is described as being 2000 mm in length, as shown in the included images. I measured the cable using a tape measure and the cable is indeed 1500 mm or 1.5 meters in length, not including the extra tips on each end. The cable is a solidly constructed green cable with black and clear color plastic on either end of the cable. It is essentially a USB-C to USB-C power and data cable with a USB-A extension on one end and an Apple compatible Lightning connector on the other. The box also contains a string pouch to store and protect the cable, a nice touch in my opinion. I tested the cable with a Pixel 7, an iPad Mini 4, a MacBook Air M1 and a PC running Windows 11. Data file transfers were flawless and fast. A 200 MB pdf file transferred from PC to Android in about 10 seconds. The iPad connected and synced with the MacBook air flawlessly. I also tested charging using a 65 watt USB C charger. The Pixel reported fast charging when connected. The iPad charged successfully. The photos in the review were uploaded to a PC using the USB A connector to a USB hub. Mechanically the cable worked as advertised. I intend to use this cable extensively since it is so versatile. My only concerns were I wonder how sturdily the Lightning and USB tips are attached and I noticed that the Lighting adapter didn't fit as snugly as the other tips did. I also would be hesitant to order this if I was using thick cases for my equipment due to the large size of the cable adapter ends. They might have difficulty fitting if the port opening on the case was too narrow. I did not experience any issues and recommend this cable for anyone currently carrying around a multitude of different cables to connect various tech items. Data transfer and charging both worked well and this will be part of my EDC going forward."
