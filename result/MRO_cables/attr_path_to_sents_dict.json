      "B07CN5974J ★★★★★ <b>A Real Problem Solver</b> I really don't like working with 12-2 wire, especially in junction boxes where using wire nuts with four 12-2's can be a pain. These Wago's made the connection really easy. They're pricey, at least the 5 hole ones that I bought were, and they're slightly bigger than wire nuts, but well worth it. I'd also take the time to read the user's guide that arrives in the packet, that way you'd realize much sooner than I did that you have open the lever the full 90 degrees before you insert the wire.

This alleviates a lot of the pain because you don't have to twist on the wire nuts. I *would not* use this with anything bigger than a 12v though as wires can easily poke through the nuts. I found putting my 12v milwaukee impact on 1 settings makes it so they won't poke through. Basically just hold the wires in your hand, let the impact roll until it clicks, and you're set. My only gripe is does not work with large blue/gray wire nuts. I already recommended to multiple coworkers and they have purchased. This is excellent for commercial electricians.",

I have it chucked into my 1/4\" impact with the torque turned down to keep from over tightening and this is a game changer on make up. It fits the red and yellow wire nuts with wings fine and that's probably 95% of what I'm using. After a while using this it's easy to just listen and tell when the wire nuts are tight enough. A fast reverse to check and make sure all the wires were captured in the nut and another spin tight and I'm done. I should have added one of these to my work tool collection a long time ago!",

I'm not sure how it might be with a thinner wire.

The exterior coating is thick and it has an additional plastic layer + a plastic separator. It’s “exterior” for about 3” of wire on this run but I’m also going to run it direct-burial to my generator and I have confidence it will hold up. It fit standard Cat6 ends (barely). Standard tension guards also fit on the wire but once again, barely. My gripe is that there are defects on the individual wire sheathing (mostly green stripe). It’s bubbled and extra thick in places so if you accidentally find a piece like that, you lose 1 inch to 1 foot recutting the wire until you find an inch or two that will push into the connector. I can’t find this wire in black locally so I’m not complaining too much but be aware it’s frustrating and probably not what you want for your 10Gbps network. I’m using it to power/connect an exterior POE Wi-Fi AP and connect a generac generator and I’m confident that it will provide solid stable low-bandwidth connections.",

Don't forget to use tape, shrink wrap, or even clear glue works Perhaps I will find the trick to working with this but I found it rather miserable to strip the outer PVC jacket without nicking the two inner conductors. I did watch the stripping video in this listing, which makes it look easy. It is also different wire. That was three conductor, this is two I was impressed to see all of the manufacturer and importer information on the box. Regardless, I found the cable to be stiff. It is as if it is already vintage and hardening up. So between the lack of ease of use and the stiffness: 2 stars",
      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★☆☆ <b>There are no ratings, UL or otherwise, on this cable</b> Ok, so I guess it really depends on what you are doing as to how happy you are going to be with this cable. If you are doing nothing more than running speaker wire, then good for you. You should be happy with the cable. If you are running power wire for an appliance, a solar system, or for any standard project other than low voltage battery, you will have to pause and wonder. What is the voltage rating? What is the current rating? Is this really OFC or something else? You can think it is something, but you will NOT know for sure. If you have an inspector ask for the ratings, you are out of luck and will have to rewire your project. The company says that it is 10 GA Oxygen free copper and they say the rating on the insulation is 200V. So, the problems start when you look at Silicon insulation and find that the normal low voltage rating is 600V up to 35,000V. 200V does not appear in any standard. Most oxygen free tinned copper still looks like copper when you cut it. This cable does not do that, even with a magnifying glass. So, how do you know? Nothing on the cable indicates that it is OFC or anything other than 10GA. Ok, once you get that resolved in your mind, this cable is designed like lamp zip cord except it splits way too easily. Great concept, but you will need to secure the cable ends somehow if you do not want it pulling apart. You can use electrical tape, shrink tubing, or even a tie wrap not pulled too tight. The cable itself is very flexible, like you would expect from a silicon wire. For use in a solar system where there is NO ground and you are required to install a breaker on both the negative and the positive side of the supply, this type of cable works very well. In fact, it is the project I started using it on until the Building inspector asked to see the data sheet on the wire or at least the UL number. Since I could not produce it, I had to remove what I had done and switch to a UL rated cable. Does that make this a bad product? No, it only makes it a quesitonable product since you do not know exactly what you have. I have not been able to find a way to directly contact the company to ask for a spec sheet. I just hope they watch the reviews and can provide the requested item, then this would be a product I would recommend. Until then, I cannot recommend it.",

      "B09DB9FD5M ★☆☆☆☆ <b>It's 18 gauge electrical cable, but it's unmarked and smells very bad.</b> There is no spec markings on the casing so it can't be used in any application where a home inspection would require it. Mine came as a twisted mess that looks unprofessional and not really useable for anything more than auto speaker wire. Looks like just a haphazard cut from a much larger spool. Biggest complaint is it stinks up whatever room it is in. It is potent and I think the manufacturer knew this because it came double bagged. I thought the busted sauce that was in the Amazon box this came together in was what smelled up the box but several days later it's definitely the wire as I can smell it from 8 feet away. The price isn't bad and the copper wire itself seems ok. But the jacket used isn't useable for any code regulated work and it's only marking is the meter length interval. The jacket is also pretty thin and the inside wiring easy twists and came twisted. I wouldn't recommend it for anything beyond audio or LED work where the load is rather light.",

I'm like are you on or you off? Make up your mind! SO I just wanted to wait it out, for review purposes. It lasted a full 7 minutes before completely unraveling itself. So I pushed it back, pressing it harder and waited, that came off in about 3 minutes. What is the point if it won't stick at all? So I then had to carefully roll it back to fit in the hole provided in the box so I could send this back for return. I'm hoping the return is accepted, I'm sorry that it can't work out. I tried. Unfortunately, I'll be going with the nail clips which are a bit more time consuming but will be permanent.

I dug a small trench about 6\" deep under a couple of my gates and buried the RiteFENCE, and left each end protrude out of the ground about two feet to connect to one of the lower existing fence wires so as not to disconnect the continuous circuit at any time when opening gates now. I chose the 6\" depth to bury the heavily insulated RiteFENCE since in addition to moving livestock through the gates, I also drive vehicles and farm implements through the gates as well. The RiteFENCE is very sturdy and rigid, and the 12-½ gauge took some time to straighten out to fit flat and neatly into the trenches I dug and placed the wire into, but this is a definite plus for electric fence wire to be used on a farm or ranch. The RiteFENCE doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and has a thick outer coating with the inner wire apparently coated as well for the 'double insulation' aspect. When installing, I also cut back a couple of inches of the RiteFENCE on each end and used a heavy duty crimp connection to the barb wire fencing I use. Once crimped, I neatly wrapped the connections with quality electrical tape to seal from the elements. The RiteFENCE is going to be ideal for many other underground connection needs I have around the farm. I would highly recommend any farmers and ranchers who run electric fence to give the RiteFENCE a try if you want to eliminate the risk of a nasty shock, especially with the higher powered fence chargers. The price point seems very fair and in fact is actually a little cheaper than what I saw at my local farm supply store. Highly recommend!",

I've been doing low voltage wiring for thirty plus years, this is by far the worst wire I have ever purchased. My intown supplier was out of what I needed, so I ordered this wire, unfortunitly I looked at the star rating BUT did not read other detailed reviews. I was deceived! As a result of this one box of crap wire, it ended up costing my conpany well over a thousand dollars, being that I had to rent a lift the day of the install plus pay labor. I had to do the complete job over the next day, after spending 13 hours running this crap wire and troubleshooting why the IP cameras I installed were not working. All but one 25' wire run, the very first pull, was defective! If Amazon does not pull this off their listing I will be getting an attorney.

Also, when separating the two wires, it split much more easily and consistently than a slightly cheaper brand I used previously, which actually peeled the insulating jacket away from the wire several times. In summary, this wire worked well and I would have no problem using it along with other Sunvie products, which I have been very happy with. Each year I add more and more outdoor lighting, as we really like the look and have found it to be transformative. It would be nice if Sunvie would ultimately offer discounted packages of lights, transformers, wiring and connectors, for one-stop shopping.",

This cable is quite thick for the pin to make a good connection with the copper wire and some of my lights have taken several tries to get them to connect. My previous experiences with this type of connector and another brand of cable were quite positive.....now, using the identical lights again, they do not work as well with this cable.

With 4 strands inside the single casing, this will allow for the 4 contained strands to be pulled without the mess of 4 individual strands being pulled and having to be taped, loomed, or wire tied for wire management. The 4 individual contained wires are also color coded for easy identification on each end of the contained wire.

      "B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★☆ <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again).",

Rubber cable end caps, which I assume are meant to protect the cut copper ends from oxidizing over long periods of storage. 2. A velcro tie. 3. Low odor. At least compared to some cheaper wire, which can instantly stink up my entire room. Last but not least, this cable is made in Korea by a company that is itself compliant to very strict standards.

Highly recommended if you can afford the premium, and/or need it for critical applications that need to be standard compliant.",
      "B0C6R2NJD2 ★★★★★ <b>Made in America!</b> Those words “Made in America” are words that aren’t often heard anymore. For me, that's a great selling point and one of the reasons that I ordered this coil of wire. The short version of this review can be summed up in one word: perfect. The outer insulation of this wire strips easily with either a romex stripping tool or (shudder) a sharp knife. The individual conductors’ insulation can be removed almost as easily as it’s not bonded to the surface of the copper conductor. Thankfully the conductors themselves are solid copper wire and not copper clad aluminum otherwise known as CCA. And for a bit more icing on the cake, this coil of Arizona Electrical Solutions wire costs less than half of what the same length coil of wire in the big box stores near me costs. And in case 25 feet of 14 gauge wire is not what you need for your next project, this company also sells other gauges and lengths here on Amazon. And again, it's made in America. This is truly a winner.",
      "B0CP48T2SJ ★★★★★ <b>Excellent!</b> First of all, it's actually made in the U.S., in New York state. It's well insulated, but strips easily for installation. It stays coiled when the wrapper comes off, (easy to transport to the job site), but unrolls easily without becoming tangled. Price was lower than similar product made overseas that you'd buy at big box stores. I'll be coming back to this company for all my future electrical projects.",
      "B07111R7N8 ★★★★★ <b>Best bang for buck</b> Been looking through amazon for cheapest, yet somewhat durable, lug terminals and these were the only ones that made it. But also because most people opt for 1/0 gauge instead of 1 AWG so there are far more 1/0 stuff out there than regular 1AWG. My only reason for getting the 50 pack for 1AWG was because I got about 30ft of it for free (leftovers from another guy's project), and because the 50 pack meets the better value for amount of $/terminal without paying the price of the 100 pack. Could have went with a 10 or 25 pack, but those have far worse $/terminal. If I mess up some, I still will have about 30+ left, but it's unlikely. There are no other companies that make this specific size with this amount of quality and at an optimal $/terminal, even the chinese made ones. In fact, the worse quality chinese ones are more expensive than these that are made in the US, and I haven't seen any in 1AWG that are under $0.70/terminal and with no complaints of \"copper is too thin, so breaks easily.\" You can easily spend over 2 hours looking for some decent quality, cheap lug terminals, but this company is the only one that does it (assuming that you buy in 50/100 pack). Sometimes you come across funny reviews that buy 4/0 lugs for 4AWG cables. Heck even if you don't buy a 50/100 pack the quality of these dominate the majority of lug terminals out there. Didn't know you could just order directly from their site, but there's a small discount if you do cause of the amazon seller fee.",

Wire appears to be the same quality as what you get at the big box stores but at a better price 25 vs. 40 and it's shipped right to my door.

It's stripped nicely at the 14 size for both the jacket and the wires with my electrical pliers and felt the exact same as other 14/2 I have used in terms of how it bent and how it felt rolling the extra left over.

I myself got the kit because although I have lots of wire in my workshop, most of it is \"reused\" wire from otherwise discarded items, and I don't really have an assortment of colors available to color-code different circuits (which gives a nice neat appearance plus makes it easier to understand the function of different circuits if/when maintenance on them is required up the road). There are a total of eight different colors in this kit, which includes the commonly-used red, black, green, white and yellow. The quality of the wire is really good, with soft and very flexible insulation that's easy to strip, and tinned copper that won't tarnish and potentially cause issues in the future when being soldered. There are some nice bonuses included in the package as well, which although they are mentioned in the product ad I somehow failed to notice until the box arrived and I had a nice surprise. These is a selection of heat shrink tubing and plastic wire ties that match each of the 8 colors of wire. Also included is a little stripping tool.

Very nice!",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>Great wire for hobbyists</b> This wire kit makes a great kit for hobbyists who need several pieces of different colored wires in a project. This kit comes with 8 rolls of wire (brown, white, black, red, orange, blue, yellow, and green), a bag of zip ties, a bag of heat-shrink tubing, and a wire stripper. The bags of zip ties and heat-shrink tubing include zip ties and heat-shrink tubing that match the colors of the wires with the exception of black zip ties. The kit I received did not include any black zip ties but those are easy to find elsewhere. The wire features silicone insulation and is very flexible. The insulation is soft enough that it can be easily stripped by simply pinching and pulling on the insulation. This makes the wire easy to work with but causes some concern for how easy the wire could be damaged. The box features holes that make it easy to pull the wires out of the box while keeping the spools contained in the box. The included wire stripper is very simple but a good addition to the kit. Most hobbyists will prefer to use their own wire strippers, but some beginners may find the included wire stripper useful. Overall, this wire kit seems like a great kit for hobbyists who prefer a clean and organized project and workspace."

Can't use it in tight packed fixtures where size 22 was a perfect fit so far. Forget soldering it to smaller connectors with a few pins. Since I did not use it, I can't comment on other wire qualities. I assume extra thickness may be a plus where it is desired. Not for me. Also, entire wire seems very soft, almost like stranded wire. My old hookup wire was solid and much harder, stiffer.

The insulation could have been a little thinner and sometimes makes the wire a little difficult to work with in tight spots where many wires need to be connected to a small connection point and so on. That said it's unlikely to short, the insulation is unlikely to perish to the point where it's not insulating.

      "B08F7LHG9Q ★☆☆☆☆ <b>It measures out between 22 and 23 AWG</b> I purchased this wire because I needed a main run of 20AWG to meet the current needs of a parallel string of five LED strip lights. When I first stripped this wire it appeared that the insulation was unusually thick in relation to the stranded wire within, so I got out a micrometer and measured the strands. The conductors in the roll I received are .022\" to .023\" in diameter. That is roughly equivalent to 23AWG and would not carry the current in my application.",
      "B0CSD3GJ53 ★★★★★ <b>Great wire, but not compatible with some crimp connectors</b> I installed our landscape lighting almost 2 decades ago. Some bulbs have gone out due to failing electrical connectors. I tried replacing the connectors, but the insulation on the existing wire has become so hard that the prongs on the connectors just don’t penetrate correctly anymore. I ordered this to replace that hardened landscape wire. Unfortunately, the Quic Disc connectors I used previously do not work with this wire. Its insulation is slightly thinner than the original wire, and the conductors are spaced closer together. The Quic Disc prongs don’t align properly with the new conductors. If one prong hits the center of one conductor, the other prong can miss the other conductor entirely. The lights are only a few feet apart in a long flower bed, and I didn’t want to cut this wire into many short segments to use wire nuts at each light. So I tried the new Malibu Low Voltage Cable Connectors that pierce the insulation from both sides. They work perfectly, and have the advantage that the wire doesn’t have to be split apart every few feet to use an alternate piercing connector. Bottom line, this is great wire, with real copper conductors and flexible insulation that is easy to work with. It just isn't compatible with crimp connectors that expect the conductors to have the same spacing as in old 12 gauge landscape wire.",
      "B07JMVX22G ★★☆☆☆ <b>Insulation is much too thick for 24AWG</b> The insulation is about 2X (2.54mm vs about 1.5mm) too thick to be useful for breadboard work and dupont terminals."

The outer sheath is a nice thickness and molded tight to the three conductors , which will help prevent moisture intrusion. The insulation on the individual wires is on the thinner side, but again, the outer sheath toughens the whole bundle. The combination, along with the 27 tinned copper filaments in each wire, allows the wire to be fairly flexible.

It seems to be working well, but I'll need to come back in a year or so, to see how it's holing up. One thing I did notice is that the outer insulation is VERY thick. I suppose this is good and bad. (Probably mostly good.) What's bad is that it was too thick to work with my standard wire stripping took, so I needed to remove the outer insulation by hand, using a razor blade. The thickness of the insulation, and the fact that it's not a uniform thickness all around (see photo), made it hard to cut off the outer insulation without nicking the inner insulation on the individual conductors. The GOOD aspect is that the extra-thick outer insulation will likely protect the conductors from being crushed or otherwise damaged during use. (An extra-thick outer layer of insulation could come in especially handy for outdoor buried applications, to protect against a spade or small shovel , for example, when planting flowers.) So far, I am pleased with this product!",

The outside insulation jacket is a very thick PVC material, it wasn't real easy to cut so it shouldn't nick easily (think of a errant nick from using a wire staple). Even though it's a thick jacket, it's super pliable. The inside wire insulation both cuts and strips more easily than the outside and is easy to work with. I only hesitate saying a joy, because it sounds to corny... There's about a million different uses and projects that this wire would be perfect for, you'll certainly run out of wire before you run out of projects. It is NOT house wiring or electrical supply to anything... it's very small, 22 gauge is tiny.. In a house, it would be doorbell or maybe 'ring' style wiring (or alarm sensors), garage door buttons & sensors, not for lights or outlets, extension cords, etc..

Luckily, a variety of providers have arisen over the past few years. Here we have one where most of the work has been done for you, with the AC plug already connected. Now there's no question that this is a contemporary AC plug, and if you're doing a genuine restoration, you probably won't go this route, but there's also no question that this is a safe approach and one that is probably going to be hidden by furniture anyway. In this case, the fabric wrap covers two independently insulated wires, already stripped and soldered and ready to be wired directly into your device, lamp, appliance, etc. The fabric has a nice sheen and looks great; I picked the brown color to go with a copper lamp - works perfectly.",

I was able to make a quick slit with utility blade grab the wires and tear down the sleeve to the spot I wanted the sleeve removed. I used this to wire up new DC dimmable led lamps in my warehouse.

      "B0C5BLQ327 ★★★★★ <b>Nice length for small project.</b> 25ft is not much, so if you are doing a small job it is great. 12guage is perfect as well for 20 amp breakers, and more than needed for 15 amps. This is a standard Romex style wire with vinyl outer sleeve and insulated individual wires, (white, black, and uninsulated ground.) I do wonder why we do not insulate our ground wires, but that is the standard here and I haven't seen any issues to date with that. Honestly, ground and neutral seem to be ok on the same ground blocks unless you feed into a sub panel where neutral and ground have to be on separate bus bars. Moving on from the lesson, I can say this is a good 12/2 romex that I can recommend that is also decently priced. Locally 15ft of 12/2 romex costs 28 dollars and 40 dollars for 25ft just to give some context on how good this is as a deal."

This wire itself is decent, and it takes solder very well, but although the silicone insulation is very flexible, the quality is sub-par. High quality 2-conductor wire will “unzip” easily and the insulation will remain intact, but this doesn’t separate cleanly because of the way it’s made and because the silicone is of a lower quality.

Once i get a street map of wires on the back of perfboard i can confuse my own self just fine without also having to suss out ambiguous wire colors. I've attached a photo to illustrate. I wanted to make a side-by-side comparison to my 24 gauge wire but couldn't get the lighting right to show the contrast. Doesn't matter... when i opened the box i thought, \"that's orange wire\". I've since decided it's probably brown. But i'm not gonna gaslight myself, dangit, it ain't red. There's a whole science to naming visible light wavelengths and all the attendant complications and i have neither the expertise nor the tools.

I do realize it’s silicone insulation but this stuff is more like rubber, you can’t form it in anyway it just bounces back, definitely not recommended for repairing or building amplifiers, I will cut my losses and just throw this stuff out … The voltage rating thing really makes me nervous, it’s the first thing I looked for in the sellers advertisement and then when I finally received it there’s no proof that it’s 600 V anywhere, I find that very strange",

      "B000BPEQCC ★★★★★ <b>Great for home security lighting.</b> I added home security lighting around my house in areas where I did not previously have electricity ran. I used this wiring along with electrical conduit to bring electrical lines out of an existing garage outlet out through a hole under my eaves and along the side of my house tucked in back just below the eaves. My only complaint is that the rubber is very durable and difficult to cut off un order to bring out the wires for wiring up my lights. But that durability also makes the difficulty worthwhile.",
      "B0CP48T2SJ ★★★★★ <b>Insulated Well !!!</b> Each copper wire insulated and then both wires insulated by thick rubber like insulation. Not just a thin skin over both wires but thick insulation molded around both wires for added protection. Look no where else if you want the best wire you can find. Used it to rewire camper brakes, no comparison to cheap wire that came on camper.",
      "B0B5DSNSFX ★★★★☆ <b>Perfect for 12V projects and sound systems</b> Straight out of the box both spools of wires are exactly as described. The insulation is thick, still flexible enough to work with. I used it on a 24V Solar power project and on a car sound system; it worked perfectly on both projects. The insulation looks and feels more “rubberized” than “hard plastic”, which gives the wire the flexibility needed, specifically for when you have to run the wire through panels, and it helps routing too, it looks more neat and easier to secure it. For the price listed, and for the specifications being accurate, I think this product is a good purchase.",
      "B0BXT6SBZ4 ★★★★★ <b>handy set of multi-colored thin wire for projects</b> I do a bit of small electronic projects and have a significant one coming up this summer. So, I wanted to have a bit of wire on hand for that. I found this multi-color bundle of stranded 22 gauge wires from QSJXZGH. There are 5 rolls, each with 26.2 feet of wire. There is a roll of red, black, yellow, blue, and green. The insulation is rubbery and stripped off easily for me. This set comes with a nice little cardboard box. There are small holes on both sides where you can feed the wires through to act as dispensers. One side is under the lid, so the wire ends are held under the lid when not in use. The other side is opposite so you can keep the lid closed and be able to pull wire out. It also comes with a small pack of heat shrink tubing in the same colors as the wires. I'm pleased with this set. It's not a massive amount of wire, but gives me some options for wire colors to help me keep my circuits straight.",

The jacket is not overly thick, but seems to protect well. It feels a bit soft. More rubbery than most vinyl coated wire I've used in the past. I like that though because it has less memory and is more flexible. This wire would be perfect for automotive or other low voltage work. Finally, I feel the price is decent. Copper is still stupid expensive, and yet this wire manages to be an ok price. I dig it.",

The wire was ordered to extend lighting circuits consisting of low current LED lighting. The cable is round, has a minimal thickness rubber insulation encapsulating two 14 gage insulated wires. As indicated in the description, the cable is rated for voltages below 300 volts, so traditional 120 Volt lighting circuits are a perfect use. Also, I am in the process of replacing table lamp cords. I am finding that older cords are becoming brittle, and could be a source of electrical fires. The 14 gage wires are good for up to 15 amps.

      "B0CSD3GJ53 ★★★★☆ <b>ETL listed, just like regular zip wire but 12 gauge</b> With spring headed our way, we're beginning to plan for some landscaping improvements in our yard, and low-voltage lighting is one of the things I'd like to add, so I picked up this wire. This wire looks like your typical lamp cord/zip wire, but at 12 gauge, this is pretty stout wire. Like zip wire, the two conductors are insulated in black flexible rubber insulation and joined by a thin section of rubber in the middle, so you can easily split the two conductors apart for making any necessary connections. And like typical zip wire, one of the conductors is identified by ribbing on the exterior of the insulation; this conductor is used, by convention, as the neutral wire. I've learned the hard way that before you put any wire into service, check it for breaks. Both conductors in this 100 foot spool passed the continuity test. What else is there to like? They include a chart (see photo) that shows the maximum wattage for any given length and gauge of wire, so it's nice to have that as a handy reference. It's also ETL listed (sort of like UL listed). For low voltage applications like landscape lighting, you could argue that being ETL listed is overkill, but it's a nice thing to have regardless since it is rated for up to 300 volts. One minor nit--I wish that they had length markings on the wire like some wires do--once you start using this, it's nice to be able to know how much length is remaining without having to unspool it and find it's not enough. Again, maybe overkill for a 100' spool but that would have been a really nice touch.",
      "B0CGQ29J9Q ★★★★★ <b>Exactly as expected. Insulation feels nice.</b> Wires are stranded. Insulation is like a thick rubber. Looks to be robust. Comes with caps over the wire ends for protection. For the 6 wire, colors are red, black, yellow, blue, white and green. Overall diameter is slightly larger than expected for non-shielded. But I think it has to do with the insulation of both the individual wires and the overall. Not sure what is and isn't allowed but I'm planning to use this for some hardwired sensors and a 5V line. Looks good.",
      "B0BKPBRFF2 ★★★★★ <b>Decent cable, perfect for my needs..</b> I am rebuilding an AC-powered winch that uses a permanent magnet DC motor inside. The original control cable was damaged badly and this four-conductor cable seems perfect.

      "B07H3TV5LC ★★★★☆ <b>Good wire!</b> The wire is as described, and it works fine. I purchased it for use in ham radio applications and I've attached Anderson Power Pole connectors to a few different lengths of this wire. It is VERY flexible and the outer jackets have a rubbery feel. I like that, but I found that when I push the power pole connectors into their plastic housings, the wire/jacket tends to crimp if you don't grab it correctly when pushing. Otherwise, it's good made-in-China zip cord.",

This particular product is narrow 16 gauge wire, which is fine. Some people recommend 12 or 14 gauge wire for landscape wiring, and that might be the case for large installations. Most of my lights are LED with a few Halogen, so they don’t draw a lot of wattage, and this worked just fine for me when I wanted to add another 40 ft long leg of lights.

      "B076N2J31N ★★★☆☆ <b>Lots of cable offerings, do your homework</b> Summary: Using these for extending a solar panel for optimal placement Observations: The silicone jacket is soft and tears easily. Typically, with previous 2-wires I have used, you can split the wires apart by pulling them apart, but if you do that with this one, the jacket tears. You'll need to use a very sharp knife and very CAREFULLY cut down the middle. I added a piece of heat shrink tube to also stop it from further splitting. Recommendations: When it comes to cables, here are some considerations: 1) the thicker the wire (lower AWG number), the lower resistance, and more efficient; 2) the downside to thicker cables, is it's heavier, and sometimes less flexible; 3) higher voltage will lead to insulation breakdown (these are rated for 600 VDC). Pros: Decent fit & finish. Cons: Cost; odd 20+20 foot description; silicone jacket rips rather easily. Conclusion: At $34 for a 2-conductor (20 foot), this is $1.70/foot (or $0.85/foot), single conductor, rating this 3-stars.",

The wire is super flexible due to the silicone insulation and the multi-strand wire. The wire solders easily though the twisted strands should be tinned before soldering. I twisted the strands and crimped 16 ga. connectors. The twisted wires fit the connectors and crimped properly. I could not pull the connection apart. It would have been nice to have had a hole in the spool to keep the wire from de-reeling, but an 11/64 drill bit took care of that.

The antenna has been used in out in the field a dozen times or so, and seems to be holding up well. It's remained pliable and hasn't gotten any breaks in the insulation over three months or so of getting kicked around. That said, I ordered the pink to make it visible. Instead of neon pink (or even vibrant pink, as the listing image shows), it's a much more muted and tasteful dusty rose color. It almost looks like the color that was used on some surveillance aircraft in WW2, which is neat, but makes it harder to see. If you're looking for high-viz, don't go for the pink.",

Either way this wire is nicer to work with than your standard \"hook up\" general purpose wire. It takes solder beautifully as well. The \"THLY 12 Gauge Silicone Wire\" gets a glowing recommendation and a 5/5 from this happy tinkerer.",

      "B01K4RPB3O ★★★★★ <b>Good quality, high strand-count high flexibility tinned wire with silicone rubber insulation</b> This 22 AWG (gauge) silicone insulated wire is excellent for indoor or protected environments where high flexibility/lack of stiffness, and non-melting (or at least melt resistant) insulation is required. The conductors are a 'high strand count\" type, meaning that instead of being comprised of just a few larger/thicker strands, it is instead comprised of a much greater number of smaller/thinner strands; and this contributes to its lack of stiffness/great flexibility. The other contributing factor to the high flexibility is that the insulation is silicone rubber, rather than the more common PVC (which is rather stiff). This kind of high strand count, silicone rubber insulated wire is exactly what high quality test equipment 'test leads' have been made of for decades. The silicone rubber is also much less heat sensitive than more common insulations such as PVC or \"machine tool wire\". It won't melt off as readily as PVC insulation does if your soldering iron needs to be held onto a joint or terminal for an extended period of time. The fine wire strands are also nicely tinned, and the insulation strips off easily and cleanly, and the stranded wire solders easily. It is a good quality product at an affordable price. HOWEVER, it is not the best choice for many common \"hook up wire\" applications, since its lack of stiffness can be an issue; the strands definitely need to be twisted and soldered in order to keep their shape enough to be formed into a hook before soldering around a terminal for example. This wire also does not want to cooperate if you want to twist a few of them together, because their limpness makes them uncooperative in that regard. And if you use this wire in \"hook up wire\" applications, it wants to just flop into some odd position rather than 'staying put' where you want it to be. Silicone rubber insulation is also not that great when it comes to abrasion resistance, and resistance to some kinds of oils and such where other insulations may be preferable.",
      "B0C84BL61V ★★★★★ <b>Great wire for electronics.</b> Nice and malleable, bare strand takes solder well and performs up to expectations. Dye on the silicone insulation (of both types of wire) is quality and it's nice and shiny and not \"faded\" looking hue wise. Cuts clean as well. Recommendable.",
      "B0BXT6SBZ4 ★★★★★ <b>Super soft and flexible.</b> This is some of the most flexible wire I have seen, and the silicone insulation is immune to soldering heat with no creeping or pull-back from the solder joint. The copper wire is pre-tinned and very easy to solder. I'll have to save this wire for the special high-flex applications and use the cheaper PVC elsewhere. The box serves as a dispenser that actually works because the wire is too soft to try to withdraw back into the exit holes as is often the case with PVC-insulated wire. There is some chemical odor coming from the insulation, or at least coming out of the box. I find it odd that silicone insulation would have an odor, so maybe it is coming from the spools or the cardboard. It's not a problem for me. I recommend keeping some of this wire on hand for some or all of your project needs.",

This collection of 5 colors is great for that job. The flexibility and durability of silicone-insulated wire is awesome. It's easy to work with, and the insulation is very heat-resistant if you're soldering anything. I just wish it weren't so expensive, but that's just how it is.",

There were 2 bonded wires in the wings which retract. Both sides failed in the same manner. After arduous task of splitting wing tips apart (solvent welded, it seems), I was able to run new wires, and solder them. The silicone was a bit thicker than I was hoping for, but it worked out for me. This seems like nice wire. The insulation stripped cleanly with just two light cuts on opposing sides and a tug. It's nice a flexible. It soldered very well. I recommend it. My only noteable potential negative is insulation was a bit thick for 30AWG, in terms of fitting within small projects. I definitely recommend it. I wish it had included white color in with red, green, black, instead of sky blue, but that's a preference thing, for sure. Useful cardboard box for dispensing and organizing. Buzz has lasted 2 weeks now. Hope he continues to fair well.",
      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Great quality and so flexible</b> This is super high quality wire, which was a relief, you never quite know what you're going to get when ordering Chinese wire. It conforms to real AWG (not \"China Wire Gauge\" which always happens to be much thinner...). It's made of real copper that's been tinned for corrosion resistance. The silicone insulation is extremely flexible and can handle extreme temperatures better than regular insulation. In short, this is excellent wire for hard use/harsh environments. I think of marine use and automotive use where it will be exposed to the elements. Would also work well for use on ATV's or UTV's.",

This kit makes that so much easier! The wire is high quality tinned copper with a thick silicone insulation that can withstand high voltage and temperature. The wire itself takes solder beautifully, the insulation doesn’t melt when soldering, and it is flexible enough to be used in most situations. The kit also includes some color matched heat-shrink tubing, small zip-ties, and a mini wire stripper. You can keep the wire spools in the box and pull out small lengths as needed or add them to your spool holder like I did (see photo). This wire kit is an excellent choice for any DIY hobbyist who appreciates having a selection of high quality wire on hand for their projects. It’s a bit pricy, so the hobbyist themselves may not seek it out, but it certainly would make an excellent gift that they would definitely appreciate receiving.",
      "B0854JXFHD ★★★★★ <b>Check out the Pics & Video for a simple Hack You'll (Hopefully) Find yourself doing!!!!</b> I like the fact that I got silicone covered \"tinned copper\" wiring with 6, count it, 6 different colors ALL for under $15 bucks so yeah that in and of itself is a great deal. Now pair that price with this, albeit rather inexpensive yet thoughtful / considerate box, and you've got yourself quite the little deal but now I'm a tad bit mad at myself for not spending 6 or 7 more dollars and getting the same six colored wires @ 100 feet each. However that deal features PVC (Poly Vinyl Chloride) covered wires and not silicone. The main reason why I prefer the silicone covered wires is because Silicone handles high temps really well and is flame / high heat resistant whereas PVC has a tendency to catch on fire. Silicone covered wires may have a softer feel to them and will actually feel much different compared to the traditional PVC covered wires your used to buying but at the end of the silicone is superior to PVC in a lot of ways so to each his own. The other feature that I preferred over this particular deal over the PVC covered wires option was the fact that these wires are ''tinned copper\" which, from what my research has told me, is that that feature helps with durability and longevity of the wires itself so there you have it. Be sure to check out my video showcasing the simple MOD / HACK I came up with for these wires and the box they were packaged in and I'm pretty sure you'll find yourself doing the same mod slash hack cause it helps it really does.",

      "B0CG9DWDK1 ★★★★★ <b>Top notch real fine stranded copper</b> I was a little wary ordering this not knowing if it was real copper at this price point. Most of these end up being CCA or just straight aluminum but this was exactly what i wanted. 12ga fine stranded aluminum usually goes for a much higher price but this was the real deal. The silicone is similar to what you find on a 2 carrier power wire but thicker. I'm using this for some 12vdc landscape lighting that's cut into my driveway and sealed with sikaflex with the rest trenched 12\" into my flower beds and then into my power supply. This is perfect for my application but could also be used for premium audio as well as 120vac. Overall, I highly recommend this product, it's definitely legit and can be used with a variety of applications. I would definitely recommend this wire and will probably be ordering more of it when I do my backyard.",
      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★☆☆ <b>Seems ok. Copper color seems a bit off for some reason.</b> It is silicone, but not quite as soft and flexible as other silicone wire I have used. The tinning and strand count is good. A bit concerning is that it is hard to see the copper to assess it. It is hard to see from the cut end and when I do get a bit of copper color I am not sure if it is a reflection. I scraped the tinning off from the sides and got a little pale pinkish color. Maybe it is just that the strand count is so high (small strands) or that the copper is of a different purity than what I am used to seeing. I am sure the wire is fine, but there is definitely something different about it.",

As for any soldering - stuffs great thou higher bond point u can tell its stronger. Any splices r handled with some new solder joint connectors I just happened to snatch up and this stuff worked great in those too. I did find that there is the slight possiblity of tearing open the silicone jacket of this stuff 'easier' over other types due to having easier stripping ability so yankin' on this stuff when routing any wire runs needs to b given some added care to avoid snags on anything sharp.

I ordered the 12 awg with 10 feet of each red and black. I was just trying to round out my stock a bit as I already had some 10, 14 and 16 awg silicone wire around. I tend to order BNTechGo as I tried them once and was plenty happy with it. This stuff seems just as good as far as I can tell. My main concern was if it was real tinned copper or not so I stripped a section and scraped it with a sharp knife until I could clearly see the copper start showing through the tin. So yes, this is definitely real copper. The strands are extremely fine, which is great for flexibility but can make it tough to strip without cutting some. But that's the case with all flexible silicone wire, so no real issue there compared to other brands. These 10' sections came in just loose coils in a resealable pouch, which I guess is fine given how short they are; normally I prefer spools. All in all this wire seems just as good as other more established brands and costs less. Works for me.",

      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Nice design</b> This product has proven to be an excellent choice for my electrical projects, offering several key features that make it stand out from other wires on the market. The use of tinned copper wire is a significant advantage of this silicone wire. The tin layer serves as a protective barrier for the inner oxygen-free copper, preventing it from being oxidized. This feature enhances the wire's longevity and ensures consistent performance over time, even in demanding conditions. The soft silicone insulator on this wire makes it highly flexible, making it easy to handle and maneuver during installations. This flexibility is a real benefit when working in tight spaces or intricate electrical setups, as it allows for smooth routing and minimizes the risk of wire kinking or damage. The availability of six different colors in the spools is a practical and thoughtful feature. It makes it easy to distinguish between wires and simplifies identification in complex wiring configurations. This color-coding system has been invaluable in my projects, enabling me to work more efficiently and avoid any potential wiring errors. With its rating for all under 600V devices and a rated current of 12A, this silicone wire is suitable for a wide range of applications. Whether it's low-voltage electronic projects, DIY circuits, or even some home appliances, this wire can handle the task with ease and reliability.",

Usually this is between the frame rails of the printer, for running power from the supply to either the controller board or MOSFETS that I use to power my heat bed and hot end. I usually crimp and soldier all my connectors. For me, this wire has never had any troubles wicking up the soldier. So, by doing both I get a solid bond that I never have to worry about. The three-foot piece of each color is enough for each of my projects.",
      "B01KCPKRHS ★★★☆☆ <b>Good Wire, Marginal Insulation, and Pricey</b> Excellent, high (150) strand-count wire. The silicon insulation allows for high flexibility, but is not very protective or abrasion/puncture resistant. Squeeze a bundle tight with a zip-cord and you'll slice right through the silicone insulation. It's not very heat-resistant either; heat the wire too hot with a solder iron and the insulation will literally 'drip' off. Not much, but 5mm of melted-off insulation on a component-side of a board is just not cool. Silicon, unlike traditional polymer insulations, doesn't maintain structural integrity with heat, it just mushes up. But, that's how it stays extra-flexible.",

I have read that silicone insulation has a better flexibility and heat resistance than PVC insulation, which sounds like this silicone wire will be a good choice for my project. Although great for my type of project, I didn’t see any marking on the wire (too small?) and no listing, labeling or certifications found in the product listing. It’s not such a big deal for hobby use, but sometimes it makes a difference, mainly in other than hobby use.

      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Excellent</b> This is an excellent wire from what I can tell so far. The advantage to the silicone insulation is that the wire is more flexible than wire with pvc or other plastic insulation. When tinned or soldered, the silicone doesn't shrivel and melt back like. This wire seemed to require a hotter temp to get solder to flow, but once it reached that point the wire tinned fine. The other advantage to silicone is that it doesn't actually melt, so it can handle high temperatures better. The down side is that silicone is more expensive, but for many applications it may be well worth the added expense. This wire will suit my needs perfectly, I'm very happy with this product.",

I've never used silicone insulated wire before, but I'm really liking how flexable and easy to strip it is. I also understand that it can withstand higher temperatures that standard PVC wire. The actual wire itself appears to be of some good quality and is tinned copper. Which will be nice for soldering. A couple of the colors are a little off from what you would normally expect, but they are still close enough and easy to tell apart. The box has holes for easy dispensing of the wire and to keep it from unrolling everywhere. In the kit you also get a good assortment of colored heat shrink tubing and small zip ties so you can color match and make everything look all spiffy. The little wire stripper it comes with is actually pretty good and strips quite well. I like it because it is a great size to put in a compact tool kit like for a motorcycle, boat, car, or whatever you want. If you are like me and do a lot of DIY projects then this kit is a great thing to have on hand. I actually plan to get the 10AWG kit also for higher current projects.

I didn't really need the full spec of this wire, but I mostly wanted some really flexible wire because connecting a charger to a car battery is hard enough already. This is really finely stranded wire, and the silicone insulation both make it super-flexible. It may see incidental contact with engine parts, etc., so the temp rating (200 C) may be useful. I was soldering this to copper-coated steel clips, so I was really doggin' the heat to it to get a good joint, and the insulation which was butted to the terminals didn't shrink back or burn at all. So this is a really nice, super-flexible, heat-resistant cable for a great price. The two conductors separate really easily, so you'll want to put something for a stopper to keep it from \"unzipping.\" I'm going to put a silicone blob where the wires split.

      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Worked well</b> Worked well for several workshop jobs. Extended my garage door opener, rewired boat electrical and setup battery station for testing items. All worked well. The silicone wire was very flexible without holding shape.",
      "B0CG1GSW3P ★★★★★ <b>Quality wire.</b> Insulation is silicone as described, and it's definitely actually 10 gauge. After cutting, I can also see that it's definitely tinned copper, not aluminum wire. Very flexible and heat resistant, and it seems like it'll be able to hold plenty of current and last a long, long time. Great value.",
      "B01MSHRGQS ★★★★★ <b>Silicone Jacket is nice</b> Silicone cable jacket makes cable easy to work with.",
      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★★ <b>Nice wire kit, great for hobbyists or experimenters, or even professionals.</b> This is a nice set of silicone insulated wire, which has a nice feel. This is the type of insulation which is soft, and can handle high voltages, and is the same type that is commonly used on probe leads for your multimeter. This wire is tinned, which makes it easier to solder to. Each roll is \"only\" 5 meters long. For some people, this will last forever. For others, this will go quickly. I opted for 22 gauge wire, because that's what I'd consider to be medium sized wire, for electronics work. The non-wire accessories are a nice addition, and I especially like that the heat shrink and wire ties are color coded.",
      "B01M4HDNLJ ★★★★★ <b>16 ga stranded silicone</b> Seems light on gage, but very finely stranded. Silicone jacket is easily cut or nicked. Hope it holds up well in engine compartment heat.",
      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Good quality, easy to work with</b> (This is for the 18AWG set) The silicon insulation makes this wire flexible and easy to work with, and works great for projects with SoC boards,, LED lighting, and other uses. The added heat resistance of the insulation is also useful if these will be near a heat source (I don't have a good way to test the rated temperature, but even if you went with half of the max temp it will hold up well).",

      "B09DSQ9YLC ★★★★★ <b>Good wire</b> Wow. I love the silicone.",
      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Good Quality</b> I got the 12 gauge to have on hand when I need some clean good quality wire for repairs. Nice to get the assortment of colors, the wire gauge is as expected and the silicone wrapping is a bonus. Very happy with this product.",
      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Can not believe how flexible this wire is</b> This wire is so easy to work with. The silicone insulation strips with automatic wire strippers without any damage to the wires and the wire solders like a dream. The real surprise is how thin each individual wire is. Each wire is only .003 in diameter. I did not know they could extrude wire that thin and solder plate it. This makes the high strand count, solder coated wires highly suitable for both solder and crimp connections and combined with the silicone insulation make it very easy to route in tight places. Definitely a 5 star product.",
      "B01K4RPB3O ★★★★★ <b>Works Great!</b> Good quality wire. Much better than typical PVC wire. It strips very easily and cleanly and because the insulation is silicone rubber, it doesn’t melt when soldering or deform when using heat-shrink. Very flexible and easy to work with. I use it for wiring the electronics when building or modifying electric guitars and use four different colors – black for ground, white for hot, and gray and red for jumpers. Very happy with this wire. Tiny zip-ties help to keep the wires organized and where you want them.",

      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★★ <b>Flexible, good quality, 0.0155 ohms resistance matches 12 AWG</b> I got this wire for test leads and other places where flexibility and heat resistance are important. It has nice flexibility. Quality wire. Flexible silicone insulation. Easy to strip (I used 8 AWG to reduce risk of damage, and it worked fine). Verifying resistance I ran 1A through and measured only 15.5mV voltage drop, which is 0.0155 ohms. Matches what 12 AWG copper wire should have.",
      "B09Z2MZPHL ★★★★★ <b>Real silicone jackets pre-tined</b> These wires have real silicone jackets and are pre-tined stranded wire so they're really easy to solder if you need to",
      "B01M7NWX7A ★★★★★ <b>Great wire</b> Based on my purchase of the 12 guage wire from them I purchased the 30 for a project that needed flexible wires. At first I tried using wire wrap 30 AWG solid wire but it wouldn't solder correctly and was brittle. Ordered the BNTECHGO 30 Gauge Silicone Wire Kit 10 Color and was not disappointed. Soldering was a breeze and it smoothly pulled through a 3D printed piece with very little room to run 4 wires . The wires were hand- soldered to programmable 2020 RGBW LEDs. I just wish they would make a 10 or 20 coductor rainbow ribbon cable.",
      "B01LH1G18U ★★★★★ <b>Love the silicone on these</b> Ever since I discovered wires with this silicone shielding, I will never go back. Being able to pinch it off with my fingernail is the best. It’s also durable enough for my use cases that I’ve never had an issue with that.",
      "B0C84BL61V ★★★★★ <b>Great wire for your project</b> I've used this brand of wire for a large home made camper project and it's worked out great. It's highly flexible, heat resistant, stays flexible in the cold and easy to work with. I would definitely recommend this wire for any project you have. I'll definitely be buying more in the future for other projects.",
      "B07CMYVF3J ★★★★★ <b>Perfect product</b> Perfect product, very soft and resistant to high temperatures silicone, good welding",
      "B01K4TM5A4 ★★★★★ <b>Great for those difficult, snaky installs on vehicles</b> Really soft silicone jacket... very flexible, worked perfectly for snaking it through my wrangler for extending the leads to a rear camera that came with the dashcam I bought on Amazon.. Used waterproof soldered connections to extend, no issues!",
      "B01KCPKRHS ★★★★★ <b>high quality</b> High quality copper used and very flexible. This wire I put in the category of \"wet noodle\" because it moves and flexes like a wet noodle would. Would recommend for rc projects, high movement areas, and in general use for electrical projects/repairs. Used this wire in different colors on personal vehicle for auxiliary lighting, in my rc cars, and in rebuilding a 1945 tube radio. The silicone sheathing provides excellent insulation factor and aides in its flexibility. Awesome product and will purchase again.",
      "B09X45RZCQ ★★★★★ <b>A nice fine stranded silicone jacket 600V rated wire</b> This is a nice wire to work with. It has that soft silicone jacket that seems to be the rage these days. The wire itself is very fine stranded, which makes soldering a joy. The silicone jacket is very easy to strip and the colors are unique enough to be easy to spot in a complex hand wired harness. This wire is rated at 600V, which means it is o.k. for use in most vacuum tube amplifiers (not HAM stuff, but audio stuff, where voltages don't often exceed 600VDC.) I do wish the manufacturer offered a 17 color version, or a striped version, as ten colors rapidly runs out. Other than that, a nice bunch of wire. I'll be using it again. 20 gauge is real nice for point to point vacuum tube amp work. Five stars. wish it had more colors. Also, missing gray...which is a mystery to me...but still five stars.",
      "B0CRYX1P5T ★★★★★ <b>Good quality wire</b> It's reasonably flexible due to the silicone sleeve and also incredibly heat resistant. Not much more to say about it.",
      "B0C5QYKFN1 ★★★★★ <b>Ultra Flexible</b> I intend to wire together some linear actuators to lift my popup camper roof. I want to be able to hide the wires. This 12 AWG Gauge Silicone Wire Electrical Cable will be super easy to follow the contours and hide out of sight.",

      "B09Y9B4PVN ★★★★☆ <b>It may be 24 gauge, but looks smaller</b> Maybe it's the thick silicone insulation, but it doesn't look like 24 guage wire to me. Maybe it is. At any rate, the silicone is nice and it does the job I bought it for.",
      "B0C84BL61V ★★★★★ <b>Awesome super flexible silicone insulated fully tinned copper wire</b> This is some amazing wire with great properties. It is tinned fine stranded copper wire, insulated with silicone. It because of this it has a higher ampacity rating than other wire of the same gauge. The wire is durable, and long lasting. It was constructed to be oxygen free copper, and the manufacturer did a great job. 5 stars for this value priced silicone wire!",
      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★★★ <b>Really nice wire.</b> This is nice 2 Gauge 2 Conductor 15FT Red Black Silicone Parallel Oxygen Free Tinned Copper flexible wire. I love silicone wire because it is so much more flexible than regular PVC wire. Silicone wire can also withstand much higher temperatures than PVC, which means it has a higher current rating than PVC wire of the same gauge. This is why I use only silicone wire like this. Silicone wire is far superior to PVC wire. Silicone wire is also easier to strip than PVC and it doesn't melt and smoke when you need to solder it to a pcb or to another wire.",
      "B0BYNNJS8B ★★★★★ <b>Versatile silicone wire; UL certification is rare for these</b> Used a variety of these for work at a robotics unicorn startup. Found that UL certifications for these were very few at the time. It looks like UL is catching up for good reason - this type of wire has exceptional resistance to vibration. Unwound this and was able to conform it to almost any radius necessary. Definitely recommend for tight corners because it bends very smoothly and will work with almost any channel or cable management. The exact composition of silicone used varies because the blends are not standardized. That said, it shouldn't be a problem for most use cases provided there is UL documentation for the particular wire. Came with 60ft as advertised and is well priced.",
      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★★ <b>Good quality silicone wire</b> I got this for electronic projects and other lower-power wiring. I particularly like how the silicone insulation doesn't melt while soldering. The colored heat-shrink and zip ties are a nice bonus, to better label wires. Flexible wire, as silicone wire is. Insulation strips off easily. Spools have hole to hold end of wire. Heat shrink is standard 2:1 without glue. Stripper sort of works, and didn't cut strands off. Wire checks out. Copper visible at cut ends. Tinned sides. 350mV drop at 1A through spool, 0.0213 ohms per foot. Matches 22 AWG. Wire core is ~0.8mm dia.",
      "B01K4TM5A4 ★★★★☆ <b>Strands aren’t connected</b> Good quality wire with silicone insulation. The black and red strands are wound on the spool together but not connected. This presented some tangling issues for me. In some cases being apart could be a feature. Just not this project for me.",
      "B08FCKV2FJ ★★★★★ <b>Great for bench power supply</b> I used this cable to make 6' leads for my 24V 20A power supply. Running at full power the leads show no heating. The silicone is soft but not sticky so the cables untangle with a shake or two. I'm glad I have lots left over because I will use it again.",

      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Great Silicone Jacket 16 AWG Flexible Wire!</b> This silicone jacket wire is very soft and flexible as you would expect from this type of insulation material and the stranded design of the copper wire. It is also rated to withstand -76℉/-60℃ to 392℉/200℃ temperatures. Great choice of colors for color coding your projects. Overall, premium product as you would expect at this price.",
      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★★ <b>Nice assortment</b> The silicone insulation is quite good and tolerates a heat gun at high settings. Took solder well. Time will tell how well the conductors hold up as it is being used in an application where a door is opened and closed many times a day.",
      "B07HGT98M2 ★★★★★ <b>Flexible!</b> A very nicely made wire. Multi fine strand with a silicone covering give it both strength and good flexibility. It's good wire. Not your run of the mill off shore stuff. Highly recommended.",
      "B0CN2RB68V ★★★★★ <b>Just What He Needed</b> My husband builds synths and drone modules for musicians. His entire downstairs lab is filled with wires, cables, switches, leds, and all kinds of other things I have no clue about the use for. To me, wire is wire, but when he saw that I could order this box of six kinds, he asked me to jump on it. When they came, he disappeared right downstairs with the box, and a bit later came back up, excited to show me how wonderful they are. He was honestly grinning. About wire. He showed me how the wires he had installed easily bent into position and tucked out of the way of what needed to be worked on next and where he would button the piece up when finished. He said the silicone housing strips off easily to cut and solder that soldering was easy with them. I can honestly say that there was no cussing or need for him to step away from his project with these, so that's a ringing endorsement.",
      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Super flexible with extreme temperature rating</b> This wire uses solid tin-plated copper conductors and has a very high strand count for extreme flexibility. Although I don't see any voltage rating printed on the wire, the silicone insulation is quite thick compared to some other 16-gauge silicone wires that I have used. The outside diameter measures 3mm. The only markings on the wire are the gauge and the 200C (that's 392F) temperature rating. The ad does indicate a 600 volt insulation rating (but this is not marked) and gives a strand count of 252 @ 0.08mm. Of course with the silicone there is no insulation creep from soldering heat. This is good for RC work, and if you need a quantity the per/foot cost is much lower than hobby shop prices where you pay much more for a carded and packaged 3 or 6 foot length. Recommended.",
      "B08FMGHSMY ★★★★★ <b>Slick finish, very flexible</b> Using this wire to make bundles of 5 radials 2.5 meters long. No tangle, quick deploy, quick retrieve. Bright yellow provides good contrast against grass.",

      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★★ <b>Flexible, tinned copper wire</b> This wire was far more flexible than I imagined it would be. The silicone insulation seems durable and is rated to 200C. There is no voltage rating printed on the wire, but the packaging lists 600V. The wire is tinned copper and appears to be accurately sized 12AWG.",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Excellent wire</b> I have a dozen electrical projects going at once and needed quality wire and flexible silicone is by far the easiest to work with. The wire itself is tinned and fluffy and soaks up solder like a sponge. I was holding off on a few projects because of potential heat issues, but I feel confident this wire can handle a few extra degrees. The spools come in a dispenser box, but without a spindle and the tight spacing, the spools don't spin freely. Regardless, the wire is excellent quality and I've got 180 feet of it. Woo hoo!",
      "B08N55L9LW ★★★★★ <b>Very nice, very flexible.</b> Loved the flexibility of the silicone jacket, and certainly the 8 AWG wire has plenty of current capacity (use was a 12V electric winch on a horse trailer). If I had a choice, however, I would have preferred the inner core of solder be made of 20-30 smaller wires rather than 150-180 smaller wires. In the end it probably does not make a difference but I find the larger diameter wires easier for crimping and soldering.",
      "B09X45RZCQ ★★★★★ <b>Better than expected</b> These are high quality silicone wires at a decent price. I used these to make a remote trailer light tester, and trailer outlet tester, and they have worked great. They were easy to pull through heat wrap and extremely flexible.",

      "B0CRYX1P5T ★★★★★ <b>Very good quality wire</b> This is very high quality wire, the insulation is very flexible and is made of silicone so it will be very heat resistant as well as resistant to oils. It is ideal for use under a car hood or other similar areas where heat buildup would affect the plastic insulation on lesser quality wire. It is very flexible. I am pleased with this wire, it is my second purchase of the same brand and type of wire.",
      "B0C84BL61V ★★★★☆ <b>Nice wire to work with</b> This is some of the more interesting wire I've worked with... The insulation is soft and flexible, the conductor is thoroughly tinned, but the conductor stranding size is quite small. I can't speak to the electrical difference the size of the strands will make, but I can say it is a rather pleasant wire to work with, as it does behave nicely when you go to bend it or strip it.",
      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★☆ <b>20AWG silicone wire</b> The 20AWG silicone wire kit included six 50 ft. bunches of wire of different colors. The wire is extremely useful for my electronic projects since it is very flexible and easy to use. I would have preferred the wire to have been coiled on spools vice six bunches of wire as received and not as they were displayed on the listing.",
      "B09W2L74Y4 ★★★★★ <b>Just what I needed - a very good product</b> Making custom guitar pickups means using several colors of small wire and this set was just what I needed. The silicone insulation is a bonus since it is not damaged if you brush it with a hot soldering iron. It remains flexible, strips cleanly and takes solder quickly, making it easy to work with. Anybody making small projects, effects pedals, educational circuits or hobby robotics would benefit from this BNTECHGO wire kit.",

      "B0C63QKZ55 ★★★★☆ <b>Good wire, OK insulation</b> This is not bad wire but the insulation is not great. The wire has to have paper insulation around the ground and then around all three wires. This does have both it is very thin paper. I compared it to locally purchased wire and the difference was noticeable. I am sure it will do the work safely but there is a difference between what you buy locally and what you get here. Other than that, it is 14 gauge wire with a ground just as you would expect.",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Great assortment of high quality tinned copper wire</b> This is an excellent multi-color assortment of silicone-insulated 16 gauge copper stranded wire. It is made of tinned copper strands, which protects it from oxidation. The tin coating makes it look like aluminum wire, but it is not. One easy test is to strip some, twist it, then wiggle it back and forth a number of times. If it's aluminum wire it will start falling apart in your fingers, but this wire does not. This wire also accepts solder very readily. The silicone insulation stands up to flames without melting, and is super flexible. This is great wire for hobbies like radio control, and other applications where the wires are subjected to movement, and heat. Highly recommended! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",

It's good value for very good cables when you don't need too much length. Highly recommended.",
      "B09X45RZCQ ★★★★★ <b>Great Silicone Wire</b> Superb quality wire for the money. Super flexible with plenty of tinned strands. Would definitely buy again!",
      "B01M4HDNLJ ★★★★★ <b>Quality silicone wire</b> I try to keep small amounts of 18, 16, 12 and 24 awg wire in my work shop because I do a lot of repair and electronic projects. I purchased the BNTECHGO silicone wire in the sizes above (except the 24awg) and it appears to be very good quality wire. It is pure copper and the strands are all tinned. The wire is extremely flexible which is what you want from a good quality wire. I did take a fine emery board to the wires to verify that the strands were indeed copper and they were, the copper color revealed itself. So no aluminum in the strands. I have already used the 16 and 18 awg wires for replacement test leads on my DMM, power supply and electronic load. Very good wire!",
      "B07NPJB5W8 ★★★★★ <b>If you need flexible wiring, this product can't be beat</b> I've used the 8 and 14AWG for application in which the wire is encased in a coiled tube that expands and contracts as a telescopic mount is raised and lowered. The wire must be flexible in this application since it bends each time the coil expands and contracts. This wire consists of many fine strands of flexible copper encased in a silicone rubber sheathing. Very flexible - absolutely perfect for an application in which the wire must bend to accommodate the movement of a mechanical device. And I might add, at a very competitive price.",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Flexible and can take the Heat</b> The KVIZTY 12 gauge wire description says it is super flexible silicone wire. And yet I was actually shocked at how flexible it is when I first unwound some off the spool. It was not like any 12 gauge wire I was used to handling. The add says there are 680 strands of 0.08mm tinned copper wire. That is why this wire is so flexible. It is also able to withstand high heat. The silicone insulation does not shrivel, shrink, melt or turn brown when making a normal solder joint. And the tinned conductors make it a breeze to flow solder onto the wire. I attached a video showing the flexibility and solder characteristics of this wire. This seems to be very high quality wire.",
      "B071RT79NB ★★★★★ <b>Very flexible high quality wire</b> This wire is just awesome. It's extremely flexible and the wire is very fine stranded.",
      "B01M4HDNLJ ★★★★★ <b>Very flexible</b> Nice wire. The AWG seems accurate. The wire is is very flexible which made it very easy to route. I'm using this in an engine compartment so I'm thinking 200C should be fine but I will be keeping an eye on it to see how it holds up.",

      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>Colorful Wire Kit</b> This kit comes with eight vibrant colors (black, white, green, yellow, brown, blue, red, orange), making organization and can be used as color-coding for any project. The silicone insulation is not just about the aesthetic; it’s super flexible and durable, standing up to the wear and tear of regular use. Stripping the wires is often a hassle with other kits, but with this one, it’s effortless, saving time and frustration. In terms of performance, these wires have been reliable in all my applications, especially in internal wiring where quality cannot be compromised. Their flexibility allows for easy routing through tight spaces without compromising the integrity of the wire. While there are cheaper options out there, this kit proves that you get what you pay for. It’s a fantastic investment for anyone from hobbyists to professional electricians. If you’re looking for high-quality, flexible, and easy-to-use wires, look no further than this 18-gauge wire kit.",

      "B01KCPKRHS ★★★★☆ <b>Makes a pretty good antenna</b> I have this thing connected to a 9:1 unun which is tied to a flagpole. It works pretty well, and the HOA hasn't complained. The silicone makes it less likely to tangle which is a huge problem with thinner gauge wire used in \"stealth\" antenna wire.",
      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★★ <b>MASSIVE Value!</b> I typically cheap-out when it comes to cables for my random DIY projects; as long as the cable can safely handle the power, I don't care if it's stiff and hard to strip. But given the chance to try these, I had to. And what a difference a quality wire makes! the silicone jacket makes the wires easy to maneuver and bend but also makes stripping easier. The wires are also nicer to the touch compared to cheaper non-silicone wires. The included heat shrink is great since I don't have any of these wire colors. For the money and what you're getting, I think this is a great deal. 16 ft of wire in 8 colors is a good amount of wire length, and paired with the accessories, I think its well worth it. 5/5 stars from me.",
      "B09W2L74Y4 ★★★★★ <b>Great wire. Great customer service!</b> I ordered one of the 7 packs of 25ft silicone wire and received only 6 of the 7 colors. Contacted BNTECHGO and they sent out a 50ft spool of the missing color in 2 days. I have some of the Striveday 30 AWG silicone wire, I like both, but the BNTECHGO has a slightly thinner silicone which I really like for less bulk in really tight micro quadcopter builds. Great wire. Their enameled wire is also great for rewinding motors or repairing antennas for SPI receivers. Thank you BNTECHGO!",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★☆☆ <b>Good kit but value isn't great for length of wire</b> This is excellent for beginners, or for people trying to patch a couple of sections on their car's wiring loom. We would have loved to have this in the past few months as we had to buy wire separately (and wire is expensive!) The reason why I am giving this three stars is that value-wise, all the non-wire parts of this isn't really worth the upcharge considering the small length of wire you are getting. I did a basic comparison, and another seller is doing six colors, 100 feet each of 18 gauge and that was $27. This would make a good beginner gift but the little extras like the strippers, the dispensing box, the ties....those are all very ehhhh. You know, expected low quality. I realize wire is expensive, but less than 200 feet total of wire versus 600 feet, even if two extra colors and some extra fiddly stuff for application, and paying $7ish extra for the privilege? Ehhhh...... That being said, I like the kit itself and it is very handy for small patches or projects.

      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★★☆ <b>Nice and pliable, nothing to suggest it's actually copper wire</b> Like several other reviewers I noticed the only markings on the silicone jacket was the size and temp rating but nothing to say it's actually O2 free or copper. It is definitely a silver color wire and I see no copper at all. Super small strands of wires so it should work well in a project that requires repetitive motion. Had I been able to get more that 15 feet I would have used it in the doors of my XJ to rebuild the wiring harness that has multiple breaks in it from opening and closing the doors.",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Easy to work with for small projects.</b> I needed some very thin gauge wire to do some small low volt DC projects with. The quality of wire wasn’t as important for this so I didn’t mind taking a chance on an unknown brand. So far, this seems to be as good as anything I can source locally, and 10 cents a foot keeps the price competitive. I like the silicone jacket. It makes the wire very easy to work with. I was worried it wouldn’t hold up as well to the heat of soldering, but I was very careful and had no issues. It was too small to really use a crimp connector so I did mostly soldering and heat shrink. The tinned wire took solder well and I didn’t have any issues with connectivity or creating a solid connection. I didn’t have my calipers handy to check this versus other 20 AWG wire but it seemed comparable. Even so, sometime manufactures use more insulation and less metal to give it the impression that it is the same size. With wire I am unfamiliar with, I always size up against the standard AWG amp ratings just to be safe. It’s hard to say if the jacket will hold up to harsh conditions. For my purposes, it’s being used inside an enclosure and is well-protected. If you’re going to use this for automotive, marine or exterior projects, I’d leave a piece of wire outside for a while to test it before committing to a full project. Overall, a good value wire option if you don’t have a power hungry circuit where only the best will do.",
      "B0BY25MWGN ★★★★★ <b>Flexible and priced rights!</b> I needed wire that's flexible. I'd tried wire from other electronics distributors. I took a gamble on this and it is great ... it paid off! The flexibility comes from the silicone jacket and the high stand count. I'm impressed and quite happy with the purchase.",
      "B0CRYX1P5T ★★★★★ <b>Good Wire</b> Alienhomy 16 Gauge Silicone Wire 20ft is good wire and great for smaller jobs. Good quality wire and great that you can get it in smaller sections. This wire is an excellent value and very pleased with it.",
      "B0BXKLS2T4 ★★★★★ <b>Gamechanger and excellent quality</b> Using to wire motorcycle and the quality is excellent and the flexibility of the silicone is perfect. I should have been suing this silicone from the start.",
      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Wire seems good</b> Wire seems to be of good quality and the silicone insulation is very flexible. There is no UL listing so that will limit the usage (I wouldn't be using non-UL wire to wire up my house for instance) but there are temp/voltage specs on the spools and the wire is printed with the awg and temp rating.",
      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>What's not to like?</b> When I placed my order for this I got a warning that this is a \"frequently returned item\" but I clicked BUY anyway and crossed my fingers. What showed up was six spools of 10' each 12ga silicone insulated wire in varying colors. Nothing to be mad at there... During my work I used a couple different wire strippers to remove insulation and had no issues, telling me the wire is truly 12ga. The individual strands are quite fine, which can make crimping a minor pain but it does make for super flexible wire, which is what I needed. The silicone insulation is probably not suitable for use in, say, an engine bay, but is very convenient for applications in a more protected environment. Got what I needed to done with no hassles, and I'm left wondering what's not to like?",
      "B0CRYX1P5T ★★★★★ <b>Quality Wire</b> This product is just as described. This is quality wire in a very flexible silicone jacket. The wire is very easy to work with and is perfect for hooking devices up to power supplies. If the product description matches your needs, so will the product you receive.",
      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★★★ <b>Flexible Wire</b> This cable has pretty decent flex, considering the gauge. I stress-tested a section of the surrounding insulation with a heat gun and it performed very well. The insulation strips smoothly from the wire and the wire itself provides good solder connection. Pretty happy with this since I am going to get a lot of use around the house and doing some minor automotive wiring. 5/5 Stars",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>Good selection of wire colors for electronic work</b> Good size and color selection for electric / electronic hobbyist like me. I really like the silicone outer sheath. It's heat resistant and very flexible. Great little kit. I like it.",

      "B09DSQ9YLC ★★★★★ <b>Easiest 10AWG wire I've ever worked with!</b> Stripping this wire is a breeze. The silicone jacket looks and feels of quality, as is the wire. The wire appears to be nickel-plated copper. I used this wire to make solar extension connectors, as shown in the picture.",
      "B0CRYX1P5T ★★★★★ <b>Flexible. Diameter and resistance match 14 AWG.</b> I got this for battery connections and for electrical test equipment cables. I'm pleased with the flexibility and low resistance. Easy to strip. Insulation is definitely silicone. Resistance matches what 14 AWG copper should give. Hard to see the copper ends but no other metal would match the measured characteristics. My measurements: * Exactly 10 feet of each color * 3.3mm insulated diameter, 2.0mm core wire diameter * 0.00264 ohms/foot (0.0264V drop at 1A over 10' length)",
      "B07H3TV5LC ★★★★★ <b>Good quality flexible wire with a good jacket.</b> Used 25 feet of this 8G to wire a 24v trolling motor setup in my boat and it worked great. The small strand combined with the soft silicone jacket let me route it tucked way up out of the way.",
      "B0C84BL61V ★★★★★ <b>Very heat resistant, easy to solder</b> I was a little skeptical of the silicon jacket but it holds up to the heat of soldering very well, doesn't deform or harden if you sweat a splice too hot (tried on purpose). The tinning is great, I didn't need much heat to sweat a really good splice. The photo I uploaded is showing black spliced to red because I wanted to verify that both colors hold up to heat well. The wire is so flexible it's almost as if there's no wire inside, moves as if it's only the silicon jacket.",
      "B09X45RZCQ ★★★★☆ <b>Very flexible, but the colors are a little strange</b> The silicon insulation is very flexible and easy to strip. The wire is also easy to tin. However, the colors are a bit weird. Overall they're a bit dull. The 'blue' looks almost violet, unless you have the violet to compare to. And the brown, red, and orange are not that distinguishable on their own. Where I expected to find 'gray' as one of the 10 colors, instead they provide a 'pink'.",
      "B09Z2MZPHL ★★★★★ <b>As advertised</b> Flexible silicone cable, I'm using it for drones and it does live up to expectations, accurate product advertising",
      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★☆ <b>Silicone-esque wire, extremely fine, tinned as well</b> I purchased this wire to supplement several medium-sized wiring projects on our boat. Most of the use of this will require terminations to ferrules and will be more like jumpers between landings and switches with higher current requirements. Understand that heat shrink tubing historically does not adhere well to silicone wire. Like the 14AWG stuff, I seriously doubt this is pure silicone. Pure silicone is almost so rubbery that it has zero memory. This is good, but not the best I've felt. The wire itself is 12AWG, and is exceptionally fine. I'm removing one star due to the lack of information on the insulating jacket as well as what I'm sure is not a pure silicone insulation.",
      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★★☆ <b>Appears to be very good quality, flexible.</b> While sparse on labeling, this wire looks to be of excellent quality. Many fine strands and the silicone insulation make it extremely flexible, and it's fully tinned. I'm used to paying more for fully tinned marine grade wire for use in situations subject to corrosion and moisture, I'd have no hesitation using this wire or others from this manufacturer. Would be 5 stars if it were properly labeled.",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>Quality wire that matches specs</b> I stock this kind of wire for electronics projects and testing. I like silicone insulation for irs flexibility, easy removal, and not melting from soldering. The colored heat-shrink and ties are useful as most sets of them are one color. Flexible, like silicone should be. Insulation is easy to strip off. No hole on side of spool to put wire end. Standard heat shrink tubing. Stripper didn't work very well. Wire matches specs. Cut ends have coppery color. Core is 1.1mm diameter. 190mV drop at 1A through length. 0.00826 ohms/ft. 18 AWG, on the high side.",
      "B0BWY3JGGV ★★★★★ <b>Works great</b> It boasts high-quality materials, featuring silicon rubber insulation and high-purity stranded oxygen-free copper coated in tin. One nice feature is its remarkable flexibility. The wire is incredibly soft and pliable, making it a breeze to work with, especially in tight spaces. This flexibility is a significant advantage for various wiring applications. What sets it apart is its high-temperature resistance. With a temperature range spanning from -60°C to +200°C, this wire is engineered to endure extreme conditions without compromising performance. Its premium conductor quality ensures durability and reliability, making it a dependable choice for various projects. In my case, I've used it to craft probes for multimeters. The combination of its premium conductor quality and exceptional flexibility allows for precise measurements even in narrow or confined spaces. Additionally, it's fire-resistant and highly resistant to wear and tear, further enhancing its suitability for various applications.",
      "B091GH5GT5 ★★★★★ <b>Great Value</b> Specs are great for this wire. For tinned copper this is a great price for the quality and length. Using as ground planes/counter-poises for my HF rig. Nice thing about silicon is that it does not tangle like vinyl coated wire - a few shakes and your good to go.",
      "B07TFF9FTM ★★★★★ <b>Its wire</b> A great value for money on small spools of wire. If you only do a few projects with it and don't need crazy amounts this is perfect. The spools are a perfect size and come with little wire retaining ties already attached so the spools don't come undone. High-quality silicon for the insulation is a nice bonus",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★☆ <b>Good quality wire.</b> I needed 14 gauge wire for a project and ordered this when I saw it was available as a Vine item. It arrived as pictured, on two 40 foot spools. I also needed it to be high temp wire. This is rated at 200 degrees Celsius which converts to 395 degrees Fahrenheit, way more than adequate for my project. The silicone casing is very flexible and strips cleanly. The wire is indeed copper, you can tell when you cut it. I had no problems soldering it to the connectors. It has performed without issue. This is a high quality wire that worked extremely well for my intended use. I would order this again if I need more in a different gauge.",
      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★★ <b>Great stuff! 6 coils, more than enough for multiple small projects, nice insulator. Works great!</b> I do a lot of small projects, usually LED and battery stuff, but sometimes repairs and prototyping too. This is GREAT stuff to have laying around for low-voltage work. This should carry anywhere from 14 to 22+ amps of current, depending on the temperature you are comfortable running at. While the silicone insulator may be good up to 200ºC, I'd probably stay below 90ºC (194ºF). At 600 volts, this could deliver 8.4kW up to 13.2kW of power, depending on your sensitivity for temperature! But at 12 volts, more like 168 watts. Or 48 volts, 672 watts. Fun stuff, electricity! This has been great to have around while building out USB-C PD devices to run everything in my house but small appliances off of USB-C PD 3.0 and 3.1. I built my own 4S LiPO battery pack with this stuff too! For the price, and free Prime delivery, this is great stuff.",
      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★★ <b>Nice Flexible Wire</b> This 12-gauge wire is really nice. It has a silicone outer jacket, which makes it very flexible and easy to work with. The wire also seems to be very durable. This is perfect wire for project with large amp draw and perfect to keep around a makerspace for when you need some heavy gauge wire.",

      "B0C84BL61V ★★★★★ <b>Great stranded 18awg wire.</b> I'm always using 18awg hookup wire for one thing or another. And the stuff that comes with a silicone vs pvc jacket is just so so so superior to the pvc. Its flexible and easy to work with. Great wire, no complaints.",
      "B089D8813Z ★★★★★ <b>Super flexible SI jacketed wire. Works great for 24 volt bed heating wire.</b> Fast delivery, good choice of colors.",
      "B07JFSG6LH ★★★★★ <b>Good wire if you can avoid wear.</b> I use this for low-power ham radio antennas of up to 81 ft long. While the silicon cover will rip without too much provocation, the lengths I use avoid tangling permanently. Maybe it's that the covering doesn't take a set at any temperature, the way PVC covered wire does. The high number of strands is nice, too. It solders very well and is easy to run places.",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Great quality automotive & marine wire</b> This is perfect wire for automotive use, including campers and marine applications. The conductors are fine stranded, tinned copper, which is a thin protective coating on the copper to keep it from corroding in harsh environments such as ocean areas, or auto applications where winter road salting can cause problems. Despite what other reviewers have said, this is indeed copper wire, but the “tinning” process makes the wire appear silver unless you look at the cut end. It is typically used with crimp connectors in most applications. There is no indication that this wire is UL listed, so I would not use it for home-wiring applications or any 120 volt (or higher) AC current. The silicone insulation and fine stranding make this wire very flexible, so perfect for sharp turns and pulling through tight locations like behind the dash. The 14 gauge that I used is good for any circuits of up to 10 amps unless they are longer than 25 feet or so. Remember to calculate for both positive and negative lengths, and whether you can afford any voltage drop in your circuit. Circuits for an automotive refrigerator or fog lamps, which have extended use times for example, are different than a circuit for a horn, which is only used for a couple seconds at a time. This seems to be a very good quality and well manufactured wire, and is available in a wide variety of gauges, both red and black.",
      "B01KCPKRHS ★★★★☆ <b>Really nice wire, with one major annoyance.</b> I really like this brand of wire for it's flexibility, tinned strands, and cool silicone insulation. Looks like high-end stuff. BUT- I've used about every size of this wire up to 4 ga, and the wire itself is always too big to fit in crimp connectors. Really irks my gourd when I have to peel off a bunch of strands so they'll fit inside a butt connector or whatever. It's annoying enough to give me second thoughts about using any more of it, especially since it ain't cheap.",
      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★☆ <b>Nice flexible project wire</b> I got this because I was needing some thicker gauge wire to use in some projects but still wanted something flexible. This wire is quite flexible with its silicone insulation and verry finely stranded core. The strands are individually tinned witch is nice for soldering, but I primarily used the wire running to crimp connectors or into terminal blocks and in that I had no issues getting the wire into the crimp connectors and they stayed on well once crimped. Overall a Good choice when you need a verry flexible 14g wire.",
      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★★★ <b>A Great Value</b> Extremely flexible which is so much easier to work with. It is a great buy at this price. It has better than average sheathing and is a good general use wire for various household projects.",
      "B07CN1MF7S ★★★★★ <b>14 Gauge Silicone Wire Spool 40 Feet, Ultra Flexible High Temp 200 deg C 600V 14 AWG Strande</b> I recommend this seller. The wire is just right for wiring power to my layout, As long as you don't connect the ends of the wire together..",
      "B09Z2MZPHL ★★★★★ <b>Excellent hook-up wire</b> Easy to work with - the silicon adds a nice touch.",
      "B09X45RZCQ ★★★★☆ <b>The insulation is puffy</b> I like the wire and the variety of colors though thy are really pastels. The insulation stripped easily but when I presented it to the crimp tool I had to twist it a bid to get it through the jaws. Having said that the insulation took the crimp fine. I could easily tin the wire where needed so I am pretty satisfied overall.",
      "B01M8F9ZVX ★★★★★ <b>Works! Very flexible</b> Used this to rewire my fog lights in my 2002 Subaru Wrx. No issues, the silicone and wire is very flexible so it’s easy to work with. Cut clean and easy to strip. So far no complaints.",
      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★★ <b>premium wire</b> This is really premium wire. Its so incredibly flexible, I love silicone jacketed wire. Not only is it flexible, but my soldering won't scorch the silicone like it will PVC jacketed wire, as silicone has a much higher tolerance for heat than PVC. I tested the resistance of each of the two strands, and both came back exactly 1.2 Ohms resistance, which means two things. #1, most importantly, the wire is not broken internally in either strand, there are no opens. #2, my volt meter is consistently lousy and at least measures off the mark twice equally. What I mean by this is that at this length, according to spec, there should be 15.88 milliohms (mΩ) of resistance in 10' of 12ga copper wire, which is far too sensitive for my cheap meter to measure. So I don't know why my meter is reading 1.2 ohms, but my guess is that is not exactly correct, and the actual resistance is functionally closer to 0 ohms. Anyway, this wire is perfect for chaining together a few LiFePO4 12V batteries in parallel for a solar-charged power station I'm building. Just got to crimp some spade terminals on and it will be perfect for my project. Also, LOL at the brand name... Dastard?? lol really?",

Overall: I like it and will use it for my technical work.",
      "B076N2J31N ★★★★★ <b>Great quality wire</b> I use this wire as battery leads for remote control models that can draw a lot of amps. It's great wire for that. One of the main good things about it is the silicone insulator which lets the wire be fairly supple. That's important because it makes it easy to swap batteries without also stressing the solder joint where the battery leads connect to the control board.",
      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Excellent hookup wire with heat resistant insulation</b> Occasionally there are wiring situations where heat may play a factor, such as when running power to an installation in a car. The wire may run past a heated surface or it may just get exposure to the heat that can buildup on a sunny day. For those occasions Silicone coated wire is essential, this one is rated to 390F. I also like it for test equipment and a host of other uses where high flexibility is needed. This wire is multistranded and 20AEWG is a good size for general purposes. It appears to be good quality and shows no magnetic sensitivity so it is hopefully pure copper as stated. Recommended.",

I am confident that it will easily carry the loads it will be subjected to in wiring my light aircraft master switch to positive buss bar connection. The silicon sleeve is retardant which makes it a very safe wire for the purpose. I won't hesitate to order again.",
      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★☆ <b>Nice assortment of wire for electronics bench work; don't go by current rating provided, though</b> I'm a hobbyist maker who creates and repairs electronics, including microcontroller and IoT projects. Having an assortment of wire on hand helps ensure I'm using the right wire for the job both in function and appearance (color coding). This assortment includes 8 spools of silicone insulated 18AWG wire in different colors, along with heatshrink tubing and wire ties in matching colors which is a nice touch for neater, more professional looking wiring jobs. The spools are included in a box with holes to allow for dispensing, but the spools lay flat in the box -- not on edge like other boxes of dispensable wire I have. This isn't really an issue, just an odd choice and it makes the box a bit wider and flatter compared to a vertical orientation. Also included is a very basic wire stripper, though I don't use it as I have more capable wire strippers at hand. I would tend to challenge the specs/rating sheet included. Generally I wouldn't suggest anywhere near 22A be run through 18AWG wire. More like half that, tops. While the silicone insultation will help reduce the chance of fire from an over current situation compared to PVC or other materials, it will still get very hot and is a grossly inefficient application of power, with so much energy being lost as heat due to the resistance of the wire. Further, seeing the recommendation here could lead the inexperienced to conclude that's a safe current for any similarly sized wire. Otherwise, I'm quite satisfied with this product.",

Don't hesitate to grab some of this silicone wire for your needs!",
      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Really nice wire</b> As a DIYer and Handyman, I frequently find myself in need of various lengths of wire for projects and repairs. Since it's often useful to color code different connections, this five-color pack of 16 ga wire from Fipnot is good to have on hand. The package includes five spools of very nice quality wire with five different color insulation used. Each spool has 20 feet of wire. I really like the insulation on this wire. It's a soft silicone vs vinyl which I most often used in the past. This gives the wire great flexibility, as well as heat and abrasion resistance. The most commonly used red and black (for positive and negative DC wiring) are represented, as well as white, blue, and yellow. The wire consists of (according to the ad) 252 individual tiny strands of tinned copper wire. I didn't order this pack for any particular purpose in mind, but rather to have on hand when needed. Good to know that when the need comes up I'll have it \"in stock\" rather than having to run to a hardware store of home center!",

      "B07H3TV5LC ★★★★★ <b>Very Flexible, But Fat</b> This is really flexible wire and has a generously thick and soft coating. The coating is so thick that it made the wire a challenge to push into Anderson Power Poles. A small flathead screwdriver and a bit if effort will get it into the Power Pole for crimping. This wire works well where tight curves are needed. It has a high temperature rating too, so it should have a good lifespan under the hood if a truck or car.",
      "B0CG1GSW3P ★★★★★ <b>very soft and extremely flexible</b> This is excellent heavy gauge connection wire for whatever your needs may be. Being 10 gauge, it will carry at least 25 amps, more for short distances. Being very flexible with silicone insulation makes it easier to pull in tight quarters. It could also make excellent high wattage speaker cable. So many uses! Some reviews have talked about it being 12 gauge, I believe the pack I got is indeed 10 gauge as advertised. It is extremely small gauge strands, which will make it easy to solder if you wish to, the wire is also pre-tinned, which makes it even easier. Also less prone to corrosion. All together, it makes this wire an excellent buy!",
      "B076N2J31N ★★★★★ <b>Perfect for my application</b> I needed 10 gauge wire to extend my portable solar panels. It had to be tinned, flexible, and preferably zip cord. This hits all the high points. Since this is used only when I deploy my solar panels, the silicon insulation shouldn't degrade from the UV. The strands are VERY small making it difficult to solder, but that makes it more flexible which is what I wanted. Overall, a great purchase.",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>Nice assortment of stranded hook up wire for projects.</b> I measured this wire at 18 gauge (so no fudging), it's 28 strand for good flexibility, and I measured one roll at 23 feet 3 inches. The wire is tinned for easy soldering. The silicone insulation is fire resistant and doesn't melt and burn quickly as do some cheaper plastics used for wire insulation. The included multi-colored lengths of heat-shrink tubing and nylon ties are a nice touch. The wire stripper works in a pinch, though like most techs, I have a drawer full of strippers. I tested the \"slotted end\" of the included stripper pictured. Pressed it down on the wire at 90 degrees on a hard surface at 3/8\" from wire end. Pulling the wire out gave a clean strip with no damaged strands. A good buy!",

      "B08N55L9LW ★★★★★ <b>Awesome Quality, Super Flexible....</b> SHONSIN 6 AWG: More flexible than a 98 lb Olympic gymnast, the super fine/high count pure copper strands make this cable extremely easy to bend without kinks. You can literally tie it in to a knot without damage to the cable. Only con, and not really a con vs. an observation is they pack so many strands into the cable that once you strip back the silicone insulation and the copper unpacks slightly it's difficult to fit the bare copper into a 6AWG terminal end without being extremely careful and patient. Some terminal ends flare their openings a bit and this makes it much easier, but the straight/non-flared ends will present a challenge for sure.",
      "B0C84BL61V ★★★★☆ <b>For the price its a win!</b> Definitely works as described. Solders easily, and if very flexible. Would buy again.",
      "B07G2BWBX8 ★★★★★ <b>Nice true silicone jacket</b> This is one of the better values for the money and is really handy at the work bench with the box serving as a feeder device with little holes for the wire to reel out. No more ratted up unspooled reels to deal with. The wire is high quality with what appears to be genuine silicone. It's extremely soft and flexible and resists soldering heat well. That is a major adavantage since most other very small gauge wire tends to have the jacket start melting back when soldering if you aren't fast enough. This wire solves that problem and keeps projects nice and neat with less propencity to short out at the solder joints.",
      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Quality 12 gauge wire</b> The Fipnot spools of five assorted colors of wire is a nice kit of electronics projects. Each spool is 10 feet of wire and is individually wrapped. The wire is very flexible, and the silicone jacket is smooth which which makes it easy for passing this wire through tight spaces. This is stranded and tinned copper wire which has some benefits over stranded copper alone, such as better corrosion resistance and better soldering.",
      "B071RT79NB ★★★☆☆ <b>Really flexible.</b> Easy to use. Just be aware that the silicone is very elastic thus make sure to use a good wire stripper tool. One could have a surprise after stripping that the sheath is retracting more than expecting. Do not overheat it. Good for for DIY.",
      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Great flexibility</b> To be honest, I had planned to use this for jewelry. It works well with polymer clay, particularly since silicone does not melt at the temperatures it takes to cure polymer. BUT my husband saw it and confiscated it for (analog) audio connections. He too was impressed with the flexibility. The variety of colors is also helpful when a variety of connections come together at one junction point.",

Very flexible for the AWG. Great to have the large gamut of colors when redoing old harnesses in appliances, helps avoid mistakes. Also, nice extras, the colored heat shrinking tubes and also colored tiny wire ties are of good quality, too. The basic wire stripper may come handy in a hurry. The box is meant to work as a dispenser, though it is pretty crowded with the eight spools packed together in two rows and pulling from a spool may engage its neighbors in winding back their wire endings.",

      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★★★ <b>Actually heat resistant, at least short-term, and insulation is good thickness and softness</b> With this being sold as silicone insulation, I tested it for heat resistance by holding the end directly in a gas stove flame for one minute. After a minute of flame contact, the insulation was chalky and white over about 1/2 inch, and the 1/4 inch that was directly in the flame was significantly weakened. The bottom part that got the most heat was easily peeled off with a fingernail. The top part lost about half its thickness, becoming the white chalky powder that didn’t stay attached, but the lower layers were still functional insulation. The insulation that was right next to the flame lost its gloss but stayed flexible and fairly tough. The portion of insulation just 1/2 inch away from the flame was completely unaffected despite probably reaching a few hundred degrees F in temperature. Seriously impressive results for generic wire, and this appears to be actual silicone insulation. The usual concern I have with off-brand wire like this is that the insulation will have one of a few common problems: the most common is being excessively thick to give the impression that the wire is lower-gauge than it actually is, and then it’s made very soft to keep it flexible so it ends up weak and vulnerable to damage. The other common problem I’ve found is thin, hard insulation and coarse wire stranding so the wire has too much “memory,” making it a pain to work with while still not offering much toughness. This wiring is in the middle, with a good moderate insulation thickness, fine strands, and what seems to be a good balance of flexibility and protection from the insulation. It’s still on the soft side, but feels like it will be fairly tough. It still definitely feels like cheap wire to me, but it’s a good price and it should get the job done.",
      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★★ <b>Good silicone wire</b> This wire is quite good. The wire gauge and the description is all correct. Its very flexible as supposed to be. The wire are copper and tinned ready for soldering. Silicon insulation is good thickness. Seller product images are actual pictures and it is exactly like that. Unlike some product pictures which are rendered or fake. Perfect for my RC and some other power wiring. Good buy, I will buy from this seller again.",
      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★★☆ <b>Nice sturdy wire</b> I needed some new wire to complete a small electrical box setup I was working on. Since I didnt need a massive spool I thought this would be perfect. I like the fact that the wires are tinned and coated in silicone. This helps to protect the wires and creates a good contact on the terminals. As far as looks go, the wire is smooth and a nice even red color. great continuity across the wire and voltage looks fine.",
      "B01M8F9ZVX ★★★★★ <b>Works great for creating HT counterpoises.</b> I'm a ham operator and purchased this to construct HT counterpoises. My previous counterpoise was regular insulated copper wire and it became a pain keeping it straight, as to store the 19.5\" wire when not in use you wrap it around the HT. When unwrapping it the wire would retain the bends and would not hang straight down as you want. Trying to smooth it out and remove the bends was pretty much pointless, and it would want to keep curling back. Then when you stowed your HT, it would happen again when you pulled it out again and unwound it. I saw a recommendation to use silicone-insulated wire as it was much more flexible. I gave it a shot, and it is indeed much better for this purpose. The wire retains a little bit of memory when you unwind it, but a few smoothing passes of your hand down it gets it pretty straight, and it will \"loosen up\" even more over time. I get better performance out of this compared to my prior counterpoise, but that could be the result of intentionally going down a wire gauge to a thicker wire, the line staying straighter, the increased number of strands inside compared to the previous wire, the difference in connecting (soldering a wire loop versus using a terminal ring) or a combination of all four.",
      "B0CRYX1P5T ★★★★☆ <b>Alienhomy 16 Gauge Silicone Wire Review: Flexible and Durable</b> The Alienhomy 16 Gauge 2 Conductor Silicone Wire comes as a highly flexible and durable option for various electrical projects. The silicone casing is both soft and resilient, indicative of quality silicone wire that can withstand a range of environmental factors. While the product claims the use of tinned copper as its conductive material, my efforts to verify this were inconclusive. Despite this, the wire does exhibit characteristics of high-quality conductor wire, including the appearance of a coppery color upon scraping. Given the uncertainty surrounding the confirmation of the tinned copper, I've decided to proceed with its use under the assumption that it meets the product description. The wire's overall feel and performance suggest it's up to the task for applications requiring high flexibility, temperature resistance, and reliability, such as automotive or battery connections. Considering its construction, usability, and the slight uncertainty regarding the material verification, I rate the Alienhomy 16 Gauge Silicone Wire 4 out of 5 stars. It stands as a solid choice for those in need of durable, high-temperature resistant wiring, with a minor reservation about the confirmation of its tinned copper content.",
      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Very flexible and durable wire</b> This is definitely premium grade wire. It is more expensive than standard wire, but the silicone coating is worth the additional price, in my opinion. This wire is perfect for hobbyists, who need to make wiring harness or LiPo battery cables. They are very flexible and easy to cut, strip and solder. They are great when connecting power to something that will be frequently bending.",
      "B01KCPKRHS ★★★★★ <b>Great for low wattage light fixtures</b> I bought this for some pendant light fixtures I'm retrofitting. I needed something that would weave through a small chain easily. The light is a 30W LED retrofit so I could get away with the 18 gauge. This is absolutely perfect. The silicone insulation is very flexible and the overall wire diameter is the smallest I could find which is what I needed. I'm impressed with the product and would buy it again.",
      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Flexible, heat resistant.</b> Seems to be legitimate silicone wire. Tolerates my heat gun pretty well. Very flexible. The main problem with silicone insulation is that it's very weak to abrasion so make sure to protect your wire runs.",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>Good variety kit, high quality wire</b> I ordered this wire to use with DIY electronics projects as well as wiring accessory devices in my electric bike. The main reason why I chose this wire over cheaper wire variety packs is because this wire has silicone insulation which is more durable, flexible, and heat resistant than conventional wire insulation. The silicone insulation did not disappoint. You can see in the video I attached that the insulation is quite resistant to heat and does not melt as easily. Notice the reaction of the bare wire to heat in the video as well. The wire is indeed tinned and when you heat it, the tinning material evaporates and the bare copper wire is left underneath. This is something you should take into consideration when connecting these wires to a terminal since the tinning should be removed in order to get a solid connection. Probably a regular lighter is more suited to this task than a blow torch. Overall I am very satisfied with this wire kit. The wire is all very high quality and perfect for automotive applications due to the heat and wear resistance of the silicone insulation. This kit also comes with a wire stripper, some zip ties, and heat shrink. I could care less about these extras but it might be a nice perk if you don't have these items already. I would highly recommend this kit if you need a variety of different colored wires for an automotive project. The silicone insulation is the best you can get.",
      "B07TFF9FTM ★★★★★ <b>Ultra flexible wire, 200C, great value!</b> Very happy with this wire set -- great value, and it's what the listing says it is. Be sure you know what you're buying. This is ultra flexible, with many super-fine strands and silicone rubber insulation marked 200C (higher than PVC but lower than PTFE). The fine strands (150 of them, but I didn't count!) can be a bit of a challenge when crimping contacts... make sure no microscopic strands escape the crimp -- then it works great. The insulation is thick but soft: very easy to work with but also easily damaged if used in the wrong application. It's the right cable for routing in tight locations, since it's so willing to bend and lay flat... good for DIY drones (flexing arms or retracting legs) or making wiring harnesses that need to flex but are well protected from abrasion and pinching. For more rugged high-temp insulation, consider PTFE but it is much more difficult to work with and hard to find at a reasonable price. As noted by others, some colors are a bit off. Red is clearly orange, and blue is gray-purple. That's okay for my purposes, but maybe not if you are building to a print for assemblies that will be inspected. The velcro wraps keep each spool neat, and the box is good for organizing these spools when lots of other wire spools are around.",

      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★☆ <b>Nice Variety in this kit for DIY projects</b> I got this kit for all the little wiring jobs around the house -- repairing things, wiring trailer lights, putting up LED lights, etc. This kit is a nice little kit with lots of variety to get different, small jobs done. I tested the wire's resistance and per the American Wire Gauge (AWG) Table, I should get 6.4 ohms resistance per 1000 feet of 18 gauge wire. I don't have a multimeter sensitive enough to measure just 23 feet of wire as in this kit, but my multimeter was bouncing between .1 and .2 ohms. Right in the ballpark of .14 ohms for 23 feet that I calculate I should have. Sorry I didn't have enough hands to measure the wire and get a picture too. I also held the wire over a flame for several seconds. The insulation stood up just fine without and visible damage to the wire. The wire itself is very flexible and I like the silicone insulation. I didn't think too much of the little wire stripper/cutter included in the kit. But, it will work if you don't already have proper tools. The little zip ties are handy, but so few won't last too long! One more thing is I thought the kit is a little spendy for what you get. But, if you need several colors of wire, but not much of it, this may work for you. Better than buying several larger rolls that you don't end up using most of. Overall, a solid product that I can recommend, given the above comments. In my book, a solid 4 star product, very useful and a quality product. But, nothing too special. This product was provided to me through the Amazon Vine Program, on which I only pay the taxes on this product.",

Very high quality product. OF copper and silicone is about as good as it gets for this type of wire. I have looked very closely at it for flaws and found none. One conductor is all red and the other has a black stripe on it. I am rewiring the compressor side of one of my Heat Pumps which requires 10 gauge wire as it draws 30 amps @ 120v. It's only a 7' run from the disconnect box so I can cut the wire in half and use one of the conductors from the second half as a ground. It's going in conduit so weather, elements and critters are of no consequence. Still, it's good to know I'm using very good wire. The heating element in the Heat Pump draws 60 amps and requires 6 gauge 3 conductor wire. I finished that last week. I see this wire as a very good deal and a total win for me. I can 100% recommend this product.",

      "B08FMGHSMY ★★★★★ <b>PROS: FLEXIBLE, RELIABLE, GREAT PRICE-- CONS: NONE I'VE FOUND.</b> This is the best wire I've ever used, hands down. To put this in perspective, I go through probably 100 ft. of automotive primary wire in any given week. I do a LOT of small electrical jobs for friends and family, everything from fixing headlights and wiring harnesses, to adding completely new circuits like heated seats or sound systems. I have 0 sound degradation when I use them for speaker wire. If you use it for that, something I've learned by a lot of real world trial and error, that may help someone else out there, is to run the speaker wires down the opposite side of the car you run the power wires; I don't know why it helps, someone who's smarter than I could tell you..maybe it helps cut out interference or something, but tbh I have no idea at all and am not educated enough on that to tell you the why, I just know that it really works. It's almost like some kind of weird, ancient, wiring feng-shui that yields better performance based on geographical location. Supernatural, ancient, far-east, geo-kinestethic techniques and practices aside, it really just helps get the desired result of clear, non-fuzzy sound... ...Ok! anyways, the crazy flexibility and high-strand count of the conductor inside the insulation makes it stupid dumb easy to push em through tight fitting holes without the need to alter the existing structure of something. They're surprisingly elastic, as well, which helps not tear off end bits of wire if you're like me and use an automatic wire stripper... and insist on having the tension permanently set to \"kill\" 😃. The elasticity of the insulation, which is made of/made with with silicone, also means if it gets caught while you run it, you step on it or slam it in something while pulling the wire, that won't (in my experience) compromise the conductor inside. I know that I SHOULD just replace that section of wire, even if it doesn't appear to be damaged, which I do when time and materials allow... and I know I SHOULD stop eating so much red meat, I know I SHOULD stop smoking, I know I SHOULD finally fix that back door screen that bangs every time the wind blows any faster than is required to move a stupid American Beauty grocery bag... my point is that I SHOULD do a lot of things, but don't always get to. in the real world sometimes you just aren't able to do things by the book, for whatever reason, and this wire hasn't let me down when those situations arise. I'll leave you with my answer to the question \"is this **** good enough to be the only wire ill use for automotive and small electronic applications moving forward?\"... ...\"bet\".

      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Great for DIYers and reasonably priced for copper with silicone insulation</b> The price for copper wire has gone up so dramatically in the last few years, I did a lot of rewiring in my house a few years back and a spool of 12/2 1000 feet Romex was $260 and now over $500 a roll at Lowes or HomeDepot. The prices for these spools are cheaper than similar PVC coated wires at Walmart for 20 gauge wire and these have more expensive silicone coating and tinned copper. Price wise these are very good wires and good for small projects or repairs on electronics. The wire is very flexible and good for replacing cheaper wires in outdoor equipment that are subject to the elements or chemicals. The silicone is good for almost degrees 400F which is great for power and heating equipment as they are more chemical resistant and won't melt as easily. I have two outdoor portable water heaters used for camping and the wiring on the units use the cheaper PVC and the insulation can melt when the heaters are used for extended periods. I have had to wrap the wires in aluminum heat wrap to protect the PVC cables now I can repair them with the silicone wires without having to wrap them with protective aluminum heat shields.",

      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★★★ <b>Very flexible, resists abrasion and heat</b> This is the wire you want to use for charging lithium batteries. At 10 gauge there will be very little voltage drop between the power supply and the battery and digital voltage on the power supply will reflect the voltage on the battery. Amazon delivered this wire last night and I didn't find it till morning. The package was covered in snow and it was 20F. I opened the package, and this wire was as flexible as it could be. I started to make a cable with it and noticed the two wires split very easily, too easily. With only moderate use this wire will keep separating. The ends should always have a piece of heat shrink tubing at the ends to prevent it from becoming two wires, even when storing. That is partially an effect of the insulation being so flexible. From the picture you can see how many small flexible strands there are. I measured one with my caliper and the reading was 0.002 inches. This is really nice wire to work with because of the extreme flexibility. I took a piece of insulation and hit it with my soldering iron set to 593F.

I really liked the dispenser shown in the product photos and video and, to be completely honest, I ordered this wire at least considering it supposedly came with the nifty dispenser box. The \"dispenser\" box has 3 holes on each side, ostensibly to allow you to pull the wire from the box. However, the box is so tight, you can barely get it to close, so, when closed, it does not allow the individual spools to move freely at all. At best, when you pull one strand, the spool next to it also moves to some extent. The wire itself appears to be fantastic - very supple and super flexible. The silicone insulation is on the thick side, so any sharp bends or small nicks probably won't have a big impact on the stranded wire within. The also include some matching zip-ties and (what I am assuming is) heat-shrink tubing. Since the review is for the wire itself, I won't take any stars for the disappointing \"dispenser\" box because the wire is actually really nice.",
      "B0BY25MWGN ★★★★☆ <b>Very flexible high strand count silicone jacket wire</b> Nice wire to work with. Outer jacket is a soft rubbery silicone. Inside it is stuffed with many strands of tinned copper wire. Its very flexible so make sure this what you need for your specific application. Haven't tested/stressed in high temp environment so can't speak to its performance there. Good wire.",
      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Super-flexible and heat resistant.</b> This is premium wire with a very high strand-count for maximum conductor flexibility. The silicone jacket is immune to soldering temperatures with no melting or creep from the heat. The solid copper strands are tinned to prevent oxidation and to ease soldering. Working with high-flexibility and heat-resistant silicone wire is a treat compared to PVC-insulated wire, but the higher cost usually makes me limit its use to special projects where there is a great deal of repetitive flexing or where it is necessary to ensure that no stresses are imposed on the joint, such as when soldering to the pads of a circuit board. I would prefer to use silicone wire for everything otherwise. You can punch holes in the cardboard box and use it as a wire dispenser. At $6 per 50ft spool for 20 gauge wire this seems like a very good value, especially compared to hobby shop prices where you can pay that much for a couple 3ft lengths. Highly recommended.",
      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Real copper strands, very good quality overall</b> By measuring the end-to-end resistance, I can tell that these wires are indeed pure copper, very good quality. The tin layer makes them real easy to solder, and the silicon insulation is very flexible, making these as flexible as a 14 gauge wire can be. The spools seemed real small, but they do have the advertised length of wire on them.",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Quality wire for a variety of applications</b> Received this wire and was impressed with the quality.

The fact that it can handle high temperatures is definitely a plus. Would recommend this wire for anyone needing a reliable option for electrical hook-up wire.",
      "B0CN2RB68V ★★★★★ <b>Soft flexible silicone. High strand count. Good quality wire.</b> The wire is very soft and flexible.

It was the perfect amount of wire at a great price - so much better than having to buy an entire spool. The silicon jacket was easy to pull though the firewall for hooking up to the car battery and its jacket is thick to protect it against abrasion and it is very heat resistant as well - the perfect set of characteristics for car audio projects.",

      "B0BYNNJS8B ★★★★★ <b>Good Quality, High Temp Wire</b> I work on a lot of electronics requiring 12-gauge wire and recently procured this wire for a couple of my projects. I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful.",

The stranded design enhances flexibility, making it easy to work with and maneuver around tight spaces. Whether used in DIY projects or professional electrical work, this wire meets the standards for both performance and durability. A solid choice for those seeking a high-quality and dependable solution for their wiring needs.",

      "B01K4TM5A4 ★★★★★ <b>Worked fine.. but</b> This wire worked fine but there's a trade-off with silicone coated wire. I like that it's heat resistant but and doesn't kink easily. The trade-off is that it doesn't \"behave\" like regular plastic-coated wire BECAUSE the silicone doesn't kink easily. The wire WILL bend but it's slightly more challenging to work with because of the silicone. Also, if the silicone takes a hard bend, I doubt it will show it like the plastic-coated wire. If plastic-coated wire gets \"smashed\" you can see the damage to the sheath and wire. Overall, I think I like it. I will only use it in low-voltage applications though so it seems like the heat benefit of the silicone is somewhat lost."

The exterior coating is thick and it has an additional plastic layer + a plastic separator. It’s “exterior” for about 3” of wire on this run but I’m also going to run it direct-burial to my generator and I have confidence it will hold up. It fit standard Cat6 ends (barely). Standard tension guards also fit on the wire but once again, barely. My gripe is that there are defects on the individual wire sheathing (mostly green stripe). It’s bubbled and extra thick in places so if you accidentally find a piece like that, you lose 1 inch to 1 foot recutting the wire until you find an inch or two that will push into the connector. I can’t find this wire in black locally so I’m not complaining too much but be aware it’s frustrating and probably not what you want for your 10Gbps network. I’m using it to power/connect an exterior POE Wi-Fi AP and connect a generac generator and I’m confident that it will provide solid stable low-bandwidth connections.",

      "B0C6R2NJD2 ★★★★★ <b>Made in America!</b> Those words “Made in America” are words that aren’t often heard anymore. For me, that's a great selling point and one of the reasons that I ordered this coil of wire. The short version of this review can be summed up in one word: perfect. The outer insulation of this wire strips easily with either a romex stripping tool or (shudder) a sharp knife. The individual conductors’ insulation can be removed almost as easily as it’s not bonded to the surface of the copper conductor. Thankfully the conductors themselves are solid copper wire and not copper clad aluminum otherwise known as CCA. And for a bit more icing on the cake, this coil of Arizona Electrical Solutions wire costs less than half of what the same length coil of wire in the big box stores near me costs. And in case 25 feet of 14 gauge wire is not what you need for your next project, this company also sells other gauges and lengths here on Amazon. And again, it's made in America. This is truly a winner."

My only caution is to double check the gauge requirement for your application. These are very thin wires. They’re supposed to be that thin, but if you’re not well acquainted with electrical hardware, you might accidentally order these for the wrong application.

      "B0C9H1G52F ★★★★★ <b>Works well - Good value</b> All copper products have gotten to noise-bleed pricing of late. Even running low voltage wire is just ridiculously expensive especially if you run to one of the home stores. Ad frankly , if you're ordering wire without knowing what it is or seeing/feeling it, it can be a little scary as the quality varies so much. This wire arrives on a wooden core. Okay - that makes 500ft of heavy a little heavier, but you know they care about their product. It's also probably the only way to ship it so it doesn't end up as a bundle of knotted wire when it arrives in your standard Amazon box which in my case was shipped through UPS and clearly had a tough ride. But 500 feet of wire is pretty heavy at about 22 lbs on a 10x10-ish core. And the wire made it fine with a nice sheet of cardboard wrapped around the wire in between the core ends. The box clearly won over whichever UPS employee was fighting with it. The wire just feels like quality. It''s a firm, yet flexible outer sheath holding the two separate strands of 16 gauge wire. The sheath is UV resistant and rated for direct burial. It's UL listed and RoHS rated. It seems like a quality product and for purposes it's great. My use case is extending an existing low voltage run along the side of the property of the house to the back and introducing low voltage lights to the back yard. In southern Florida, the groundwater is high, the weather humid, and the sun hot. What better test ground for this? Anyhow it's ultimately gonna be buried under landscape rocks yet above landscape fabric in most places. Others will be direct burial In certain spots known for puddling.

      "B0CV7XP7JN ★★★★★ <b>True Marine Grade Tinned Copper Wire</b> So I really wanted to find out what makes good wire. Turns out there’s a few factors when determining a quality wire. 1. Copper is better than aluminum, as (semi) precious metals such as silver, gold , platinum etc. are superior, however, cost prohibitive. 2.copper should be bright and 3. The wire jacket should not show any wear or distinguishable defect with the heat of a cigarette applied to it. Makes sense for scenarios when a fire may be present especially on motor vehicles. 3. Must exhibit moderate to good flexibility. 4.the shielding must be smooth throughout. If not, that means the wire has not been produced be acceptable standards. Unevenness of the wire core may create sliding within the shielding due to looseness created. In my testing this wire meets all these requirements with only a slight mark off for slight mark left after the cigarette test. I think that this is adequate wire for anyone’s build requiring 18 gauge marine grade wire. The tin coated copper is even and well applied.

      "B0C5F4T9J4 ★★★★★ <b>Works Well for LED's</b> Ran some power to a few yard lights and to power some PC fans. The 4-wires help with keeping things organized and have a thick outer case that offers more protection than some other products. Not much to say other than this spool of wire was easy to work with and made things simpler. Whatever small project you are working on that requires 22g wire, this should do the trick for you. I will say that the wire diameter is about twice or three times as thick as a ribbon cable and so might not be the best for applications where you are trying to conserve space or to fit flush against something.",
      "B0C5F4T9J4 ★★★★★ <b>Soft and Flexible</b> I was very impressed by the quality of this wire when I recieved it. The cable is soft and flexible while the insulation feels strong and durable. The 4 conductors are not very thick but will be sufficient for powering LED strips over a moderate distance. I would not use the wire in a location where it is exposed to the elements but for use inside a PVC conduit or indoors, it works perfectly and should last forever. Its easy to work with (cut, strip, solder). I liked that the pure copper strands wick solder immediately without having to apply excess heat which can damage the soft insulation. Overall this is a great value wire for any low voltage application requiring 4 conductors.",

      "B0CV7XP7JN ★★★★★ <b>3 Flavors - Taste the Same to Me</b> I like this wire. I like this companies products. I've now ordered this 16 Gauge, UL 2464 Tinned Copper Stranded Wire for LED Lighting in 3 different flavors. I got the 3 wire / conductor, the 5 wire, and now the 4 wire. The 5 wire is great for LEDs with a DC dimmer (AC - hot, neutral, ground & DC positive, negative for my dimmer switch). Boom! all done 1 cable. I got this 4 wire for my third LED high bay; I already had an available ground in the rafters next to the fixture. I ran the cable down and 2 AC wires (hot to toggle switch, neutral to neutral) & 2 wires for DC dimmer. Done. The 3 wire I used for my first High Bay - I had another two wire cable for the DC dimmer. I had to zip-tie those two together. This 3 wire cable is all you need for a non-dimmable LED or an LED fixture that uses AC dimmer technology. The wire is - nice supple / pliable PVC insulated 1/4\" outside diameter 16 gauge tinned copper. The Engineering Tool Box specs this wire at 6 amp carrying capacity up to 1000v @ 30 deg. C (86 F) ambient temperature. There is a .71 correction factor for temperatures between 41 - 45 deg. C (105 - 113 deg. F) So: 6(amps) x .71 = 4.26 4.26 amps is enough amperage for (3) 150w LED lamps. I'm using each cable for one fixture – I prefer to have the amperage up there for additions and the extra cost is minimal. I don't mind the extra cost for the marine rated tinned copper, but this company sells the same cable in the non-tinned flavor also. This is quality cable and makes for quick easy installations. I'll call that 5 Stars Thanks for Reading Tip: Don't get your crires wossed. Make a schematic – if you put AC power on the DC side your likely to fry your lamp.",
      "B0CV7XP7JN ★★★★★ <b>Good budget wire</b> I picked up the 20AWG 3, 4 and 5 conductor wire from this vendor. They are essentially the same, except for the number of conductors of course. The sheath is thick and pliable. I was able to easily strip it off with Klein Tool 11061 wire strippers (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CXKOEQ6). I found the insulation on the individual conductors to be a bit more stiff than other wire I’ve used recently. It stripped off easily using the 20AWG slot on my Klein Tools 11063W wire strippers. (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BC39YFQ). Using the sharp blade from my flush cutters, I was able to scrape away the tin and verify that the wire strands are indeed copper. All in all, I am pleased with the wire and I’m looking forward to using it on my DIY project.",
      "B0C4GXNNBD ★★★★★ <b>Great 4 wire cable, very flexible, high count finely stranded.</b> This was a perfect cable for my applications. I needed a very flexible cable for a spindle motor, as well as a 4-wire power cord for a CNC router I am building. The only downside it didn't have a green wire to demark earth ground. (I added green tape on both ends to yellow wire). Like most power cordage, it is not shielded.",

I had 18AWG 2-conductor and had to run things twice because I needed 3 and sometimes 4 conductor on my last project making it take twice as long. Picked this up for the second time around and was happy with the time it saved me as well as for next time around. In a pinch - just leave one or two conductors unconnected! This wire is as described, with decent quality sheathing. I'd pick this up if it was on sale again.",
      "B0CQP4KJM4 ★★★★★ <b>Nice 4-condcutor wire!</b> I love this kind of wire! It's four wires, essentially, with a protective PVC sheathe. I love this stuff because it removes the need for corrugated PVC split-loom. The sheathe acts to protect the wires against abrasion, and if you're running wire in vehicles, with all of their tight turns and sharp edges, you need abrasion protection. I got this to run accessories in my Jeep, including light pods, a light bar, speakers, and various gadgets I have running through my cab. I like this stuff because all of the wires stay contained, which reduces a lot of the mess when running wire. If you're making an amp board for your vehicle, for instance, having fewer wires running around gives you a much cleaner install. Wire like this is good for this. The individual wires are 16 gauge, which should be plenty to handle the power draw of LED lighting. Overall, this is good wire. For the price you get a decent length, and if it behaves like others of its kind, should last a long, long time.",

      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ <b>Great Value For 4-Conductor 18AWG Wire</b> What’s not to like about this wire? The flame retardant and IP68 ratings make it ideal for automotive use and the 18AWG copper conductors are suitable for many related applications. The black PVC jacket has a glossy finish, so be aware if you have aesthetic considerations. Each of the four wires have nicely tinned copper conductors and the red/black/yellow/blue colors are common to many circuits. You can easily strip the external black PVC and use the individual wires as needed. This is a solid deal for a combined 200’ of 18AWG wire for less than $40. The included zip ties and heat shrink were a nice bonus.",
      "B0D2LVRXBC ★★★★★ <b>Just a note</b> Its wire, not much to review, I just wanted to mention a note to other buyers or my future self. No fault to the seller or product, Amazon had the “order this + this + this” option for the end connectors and clamps, which you’ll also need, but it gives you a wrong size for the end clamps. The 3/4” mounting straps are the right size, but 3/4” ends to secure this 6/3 MC cable to your metal boxes is way to big. I ended up having to make a trip to the hardware store to buy smaller 1/2” end clamps instead of the 3/4” ones Amazon was recommending. I love working with MC cable, but its always a pain trying to determine the correct size anti short bushings, end caps, mounting straps etc to go with it. The sizes are all over the place depending on the gauge and number of wires and none of the sellers actually specify what size additional parts are needed to match up with it. As a side note, its also always confusing how sometimes it’ll state (for example) “6/3 wire” where you’d expect it to be three #6 wires total but in reality there are 4 wires, black, red, white and green. There isn’t always consistency in this, sure would be a lot easier if the standard was to count the actual number of wires, including the ground. This 6/3 MC cable in particular is actually four total 6 AWG wires, black, red, white, green for those that aren’t sure. It’s also rated for up to 55 Amps, which is perfect for wiring in a 50 amp RV, Dryer, or Oven outlet. Even if say your dryer outlet only requires 2 hots and a ground (6/2) with no neutral (old style), go ahead and run this (6/3) wire anyhow and just don’t use the extra wire, you’ll be doing yourself a future proof favor for the day when you replace that old appliance and discover the new one requires all 4 wires. Easier, and cheaper to just not use the extra wire now than trying to add another wire later.",

      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ <b>Great quality cable</b> To each their own but I like using this for speakers on school busses, they tend to be higher quality cable with copper than other wires made of aluminum. As well the 4 wires in a single run is perfect for wiring up a pair of speakers on a bus with its cable routing panels. Thick insulation and wiring is easy to strip and cut, length of cable included is great, really heavy weight versus traditional wire for speakers. For my special use I like these cable spool best.",
      "B0C4GXNNBD ★★★★★ <b>Efficient diameter for a 4 conductor wire</b> An efficient way to run 4 wires. Wire diameter is relatively efficient. Tinned copper can be better for corrosion than pure copper. This will depend on your application. I prefer oxygen free copper for most applications. Cable stripped nice and clean. Good density of copper strands in each wire.",
      "B0BGMVRR6G ★★★★★ <b>Excellent Product</b> Purchased 12/4 cord to convert trailer plug from 4 to 7 pin connector. Outer casing and conductor insulation very pliable, helpful when routing cord from hitch to engine compartment. Highly recommend.",
      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ <b>Outstanding value!</b> This cable is an outstanding value! Between the 4 conductors in the cable, you get 400ft of wire for $50 right now. Naoevo also included a whole whack of zip ties and heat shrink tubing which is an excellent inclusion to help with your wire install. The outer layer is a kind of thin rubber or plastic sheathing. It doesn't feel super strong, but it'll keep your wires organised over long runs. It'll also look better than 4 loose wires. The wires themselves are true 18 gauge and helpfully color coated to ensure you get your connections in the right place. The outer sheathing is a little bit annoying to strip away since it's so stretchy, but if you cut it vertically with your wire cutters, then clip off the verticle strips, you can get 'er done. The individual wire insulation is easy to strip and work with though. As far as the application for this kind of wire, I used this to have a clean run from my home theater receiver out to my rear channel speakers. Keeps the four wires nice and clean for the long main cable run, then you can strip back the outer sheathing where you need to connect the speakers themselves. This would also be excellent for car applications. This stiffer wire is easier to push through the car interior than single floppy wires are. All in all, as said at the start, this is a great value for all that wire and the included install gear. If you need versitile wire at a great price, this is for you!",
      "B0C5F4T9J4 ★★★★★ <b>Flexible and discreet wire</b> I liked the malleability of the wire, it has 4 ways that you can also use the wires in parallel if you are going to power some equipment/light with greater power, thus avoiding heating the wire.

      "B0C5F4T9J4 ★★★★★ <b>Nice Quality Wire</b> My hobby is restoring old vehicles. One of the constant issues with old vehicles is the electrical wiring. You will ALWAYS need wire for the many projects associated with old cars. I need single strands, double strands, four strands, and even more strands. This roll of wire contains the 4 strands. With 4 strands inside the single casing, this will allow for the 4 contained strands to be pulled without the mess of 4 individual strands being pulled and having to be taped, loomed, or wire tied for wire management. The 4 individual contained wires are also color coded for easy identification on each end of the contained wire. The metal wiring is strong as I tried to forcibly separate the wire, but it held together. The main casing and the individual casings were flexible for work but strong enough to possibly last for some time. I am very satisfied with this product.",

I was able to make a quick slit with utility blade grab the wires and tear down the sleeve to the spot I wanted the sleeve removed. I used this to wire up new DC dimmable led lamps in my warehouse. The four wires allowed me to use two wires for DC dimmers and two wires for AC circuit. I found the nearest ground and ran a ground to that. Good wire - Good Price 5 Stars",

      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ <b>Good low voltage wire, if you actually need 4 conductors</b> I see nothing to fault here. I joined two of the conductors together to form a 200-ft loop for a resistance test and it measured 0.9 ohms (after subtracting 0.1 for my test leads). That’s about right for 16 AWG wire. And I love how they included heat shrink to protect your crimp points. This is for low voltage applications, as indicated in the product title. I realize that (at least at the time of this writing) the product description claims it can handle up to 600V, but I’m fairly certain it’s not UL listed for that to comply with electrical code. If you want to run full line voltage outdoors without conduit then you should be looking for UF-B wire and there are rules about how deep you have to bury it (usually one foot at the very least — and that’s assuming you have ground fault protection). This product is either for low voltage landscape lighting (12-24V) or telecommunications. You don’t normally need four conductors for lighting, but I’ll leave that to you to figure out. Maybe you’re trying something fancy.",

      "B01KWBPC7M ★★★★★ <b>Very decent wire. In depth review & Pics</b> Running some permanent LED strips in the living room vaulted ceiling. Needed wire to run through the attic from the LED strips to a controller about 22 feet away. Wanted something heavier than the 22 gauge wire you find everywhere, and I wanted 100 foot spool Those two combinations limited what was out there. Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white). Even with my current strips, would have been nice to be able to upgrade without having to re-run wire. Oh well, happy anyway!",
      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ <b>Good quality wire with an outer jacket</b> The wire appears to be good stuff and I like the outer PVC jacket keeping the four inner conductors bundled together and reasonably well-protected against abrasion and the elements. Could be used as heavy-duty trailer wiring (even though the colors are not exactly the traditional ones for 4-pin trailer wiring), as well as many other automotive and misc. projects. Flexibility is good and the jacket is loose enough to allow repositioning or even removing one or more inner conductors if needed. The zip ties and heat shrink tubing included is a nice bonus.",

I'm rewiring the stern light as well, so I'll also end up running this from my switch panel to the rear.

I will say the shielding is flimsy, it tears fairly easily. It does not hug the wires, the wires rattle around inside the shielding. The shielding is very easily cut and removed. I assume all this makes it easier to work with for pros, but for a layman you have to be cautious not to rip through to the conductors.

      "B0CGQ29J9Q ★★★★★ <b>It's copper wire!</b> There really isn't much to say here--If you want unshielded copper wire, you're going to get unshielded copper wire. Highly flexible is up for debate, but I can't in good conscience take away a star for it because it's good enough. If you're expecting hair-thin strands packed together, this is not it. It's not THAT flexible, but is is flexible. It won't hold its shape like solid-core would, so that's really all that matters. 5 stars."

This one is perfect for protecting from water and corrosion when you bury it. It comes with the wire nut that you can connect up-to 3# 14 or 2 -3 AWG12 wires and then secure with the Waterproof gel tube by pushing all the way down and close the lid.

I thought about soldering the connections and using shrink tubing but I really wanted a high temperature heat and fireproof connection and these ceramic wire nuts did the trick. I snipped the factory ends off the old OEM Viking igniters and used these wire nuts to attach those ends to the new igniters and reconnected them to the OEM stove connectors.

It's remained pliable and hasn't gotten any breaks in the insulation over three months or so of getting kicked around. That said, I ordered the pink to make it visible.

      "B0829NPHF3 ★★★★★ <b>Good wire</b> This review is for the 80 feet of 3 strand flat wire. The wire feels good to me, it's flexible/pliable. It says the wire is made of tin plated copper and the wire does have a silver color to it so that seems accurate. Five stars because I can't think of anything that would make it better wire. I got this because I figured it would be easier to have 3 strands together rather than deal with separate strands and buying heat shrink and all that. This felt like a more efficient item to me. The strands are easy to separate at the end where you are going to solder them on.",
      "B07J4FZJDL ★★★★★ <b>Did not use it.</b> The cord is a beautiful dark gold color and would work great with a lamp. I thought I might use it for my chandelier install but I decided not to and returned it.",
      "B0BRN8DWTL ★★★★☆ <b>Great retro color; just wish it was more flexible</b> I got this cord specifically for use with a refurbished Heathkit tube amplifier. The original cord was gray and brittle, and a brass-looking cord seemed like a good period touch. The only reason for the 4-star rating is that the cord isn't very flexible. To illustrate, I took the cord out of the box and let it sit for a few days. It retained the shape in the image. I then unraveled the cord and cut a section out for use with the tube amplifier. The cord, while it looks perfect from a 1960's perspective, just isn't that flexible.",
      "B07J4FZJDL ★★★★★ <b>Beautiful wire</b> I bought this to re-wire an old lamp whose wire was cracking. It arrived quickly, and I was impressed at how nice it looked - just like it does in the pictures. It is gold and shiny, and works perfectly with the lamp. I used only half of the length, which gave me plenty of length between the lamp and the plug. I wish I could find a thicker gauge of this kind of twisted wire to use on old electric fans. It's very handsome stuff.",

It's thick enough gauge for everything but the most demanding jobs, and actually overkill for most. So next to keeping a spool of every color in every gauge on hand, this is the next best thing. And anyone familiar with this stuff knows it doesn't come cheap. So along with the convenience, this is also a great value. Unless you happen to own an electrical supply house, then this assortment will be a great addition to your inventory. Like it has been to mine. A+ Great product👍 100% recommend.",

It's a little thinner than the same size wire I ordered from a national parts vendor but it was half the price. Not really an issue with the wire but the shipping was not good. I ordered about 14 rolls in different colors and they came in about 7 shipments over a 3 week period.",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Flexible silcone sheath!</b> I ordered these because I needed more flexibility than the standard plastic sheets offered. The silicone sheaths on these are great. Nicely flexible and easy to strip. The zip ties were a nice little bonus. The cardboard box they come in also serves as a dispenser. The issue I had though was that when you lined up the spools with the dispensing holes, they are a little wider than the inside of the box so the box does not close flush (i.e., bulging at the sides) and the spools won't spin freely. So, using the box as a dispenser was a no-go. Other than that, the wiring itself is nice quality, nice vibrant colors and again - nicely flexible.",

The wire is tinned for easy soldering. The silicone insulation is fire resistant and doesn't melt and burn quickly as do some cheaper plastics used for wire insulation. The included multi-colored lengths of heat-shrink tubing and nylon ties are a nice touch. The wire stripper works in a pinch, though like most techs, I have a drawer full of strippers. I tested the \"slotted end\" of the included stripper pictured. Pressed it down on the wire at 90 degrees on a hard surface at 3/8\" from wire end. Pulling the wire out gave a clean strip with no damaged strands. A good buy!",
      "B01M7NWX7A ★★★★★ <b>A great addition to enable delicate soldering of multi-color wiring...</b> This has ten different color insolated 30 gauge wires, each 10 feet long. This came neatly wrapped as shown, in a zip lock bag. The colors gave me just what I needed to replace wire that had been through it during experimentation and testing. I am guessing the colors as: Black Green Orange Red White Grey Yellow Purple dark Red dark Blue",

      "B0BWY3JGGV ★★★★★ <b>Good Wire With Extra Stuff Included</b> Here’s a case where I apparently did not read the product description thoroughly. The wire comes with small zip ties, a “toy” wire stripper, and heat shrink. I didn’t need any of those items. However, the wire itself is of good quality. The insulation is, shall we say, sturdy. A good, professional wire stripper is needed to bare the wires. The conductors are all individually tinned, and the wire is fairly flexible. The six different colors will help me to keep things straight when wiring between the six circuit boards on my project. Very happy with the wire. The wire stripper might work well as a letter opener.",

Each spool is 10 feet of wire and is individually wrapped. The wire is very flexible, and the silicone jacket is smooth which which makes it easy for passing this wire through tight spaces. This is stranded and tinned copper wire which has some benefits over stranded copper alone, such as better corrosion resistance and better soldering.",

      "B01LWI20M0 ★★★★★ <b>Some of my favorite for arduino projects.</b> I needed various colors and small wire. This is a single wire vs strands which I prefer because it tends to keep the bends I make and stay in place better. Like a lot of wire I work with, it doesn’t take solder natively, and I have to dip the wire end into my flux paste to get them to tin but honestly this is pretty standard practice. Can’t complain about colors on same spool since it was completely obvious that’s what I was buying. Overall I’m very happy with this wire but it doesn’t do too well against the soldering iron. If you accidentally touch a wire with the iron, the coating easily melts away. That’s really my only complaint. The coating is ok and can probably withstand a quick brush against the iron but I’ve had others I could practically hold the iron too and never melt off the coating.",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>The wire tins well and is as flexible as I'd hoped.</b> This is my first experience with silicone wire. I wanted something more flexible than what I've been using for LED strips. It sounds like a minor issue but I can't put into words how happy I am with this wire. Trying to bend the LEDs around tight turns without having strain on the pads was really an issue. Having more colors than black and red is pretty nice. I can specify data, clock, and whatever else I want. The only other uses I have for this is automotive wiring and it works well for that too. This wire tins up and accepts solder well and I couldn't be happier.",

      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Great flexibility</b> To be honest, I had planned to use this for jewelry. It works well with polymer clay, particularly since silicone does not melt at the temperatures it takes to cure polymer. BUT my husband saw it and confiscated it for (analog) audio connections. He too was impressed with the flexibility. The variety of colors is also helpful when a variety of connections come together at one junction point.",

      "B091GH5GT5 ★★★★★ <b>Great wire for portable antennas</b> As a licensed amateur radio operator I enjoy making portable antennas that can go up quickly and be just as quickly taken down and packed away. This wire works great for that and the variety of colors and gauges it comes in is a bonus. I've used several different gauges and colors and they have all worked well. The silicon makes them easy to pull through trees and it also keeps the wire from kinking up and tangling. I'll definitely be ordering more. Addendum: I just ordered another spool yesterday. Blue 24 AWG for another antenna. I love working with this wire.",
      "B0B5DTDN64 ★★★★★ <b>Good quality wire</b> This is a nice pack of wire. I guess I was bit confused when I ordered it because I thought it was going to be metal wire in the colors it showed but it's actually the wire covered in the conductive material I guess.

Stripping this size of cable is not as easy as I thought (good for the cable) my nails are not that sharp. I'm thinking that I will need to get all the cable out to separate colors but that is a task for another year.",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★☆ <b>Great hobbyist resource for a variety of projects.</b> This collection of eight colors of 18ga wire will definitely come in handy for an upcoming LED & fiber-optic enhanced countertop project I have in mind. I have read that silicone insulation has a better flexibility and heat resistance than PVC insulation, which sounds like this silicone wire will be a good choice for my project. Although great for my type of project, I didn’t see any marking on the wire (too small?) and no listing, labeling or certifications found in the product listing. It’s not such a big deal for hobby use, but sometimes it makes a difference, mainly in other than hobby use. You probably know the rule: “When in doubt; find out!” For me, this wire will be appreciated and I am happy to have it in my shop materials. Thank you. MY RATING SYSTEM: Based on all things being “average” until I discover otherwise, with focus on accurate, not over or under ratings. Average is middle 3.0-Star not 5.0-Star. Since only full point scoring is allowed, partial scores will be rated higher if half point or more and rated lower if under half point. Rating scores may be revised at a later date if there is a reason to do so that was originally unforeseen. Thank you. 5-STAR = Much better than advertised and/or expected. Claims are realistic; ratings & certifications are appropriate and checked out where possible. Exceeds 4-STAR. “ WOW” kind of items definitely to be recommended. 4-STAR = As expected or better. Claims are realistic; ratings & certifications are appropriate and checked out where possible. Fairly priced, good quality & usability, not likely to fall apart. “KEEP & USE” items to be recommended or purchased again repeatedly as needed. 3-STAR - As expected. Claims are realistic; ratings & certifications are appropriate and checked out where possible. Items are good quality, well finished, and priced fairly however nothing stands out. Examples include mass-produced “ME-TOO” items for sale under many different names. 2-STAR = Not as good as expected. The item works, but does not quite meet specifications of 3 STAR or better as described above. “NEEDS IMPROVEMENT” 1-STAR = Far below expectation. Claims, ratings, certifications are blatantly inaccurate and/or inappropriate. Low quality possibly resulting in failure, injury or worse; poor durability. “NOT RECOMMENDED”",

      "B0BWY3JGGV ★★★★★ <b>Good stuff.</b> The wire inside is silver in color, but I believe that is because it is already tinned. However, it does make me concerned that this is aluminum wire and not copper. I used it for a wiring project on my car, extending the leads from a wiring harness that was too short. It worked beautifully for that. Aside from that the rolls are great - provide a wide assortment of colors, the insulation is good, and it is indeed 20AWG stranded wire.

The seller even includes colored zip-ties to match - unnecessary, but fine with me. I like the product, and... I would definitely order this again (and probably will in another size!}",
      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Good Set for DIYer and Makers</b> Good set of 20AWG silicon wires with the most common colors. Perfect for various projects. Although there's no specific mention of an automotive rating, the copper strands and silicon insulation should make them suitable for automotive use. I recently used them for an outdoor project, and I'm really impressed. No worries about their performance—they're reliable and easy to work with and route. Hope this helps with your decision. Pros: Good selection of common colors Suitable for various projects Copper strands and silicon insulation offer reliability Easy to work with and route",

So far so good!",
      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Lots of good quality wire for mechanical movement and high temperature.</b> This is a very useful kit of 20 AWG silicone wires. I will be using these for various electronic projects – particularly those that involve frequent movement of the wire and/or exposure to high temperature. Wire like this is difficult to find locally and, so, to have a set like this with 5 colors and with 50-ft lengths of each is a great asset. I see that these wires are available in a range of gauges. 20 AWG is good for a few amps at low voltage for powering my Arduino circuits etc. This product is offered at a premium price but there’s a lot (250ft) of good-quality wire here so the value is good.",

This wire package with the many colors allow for a circuit repair where I may have to jump a burnt circuit on the board. Auto wire usually isn't the best choice. If you want clean work you want the right wires- these. They don't cost much, eat much, and store well. Those specific circuit boards can cost $150+ and a repair can be near free if you have parts for repair on hand. I was real pleased having repaired my potters wheel with stuff from Amazon.",
      "B0793MRX91 ★★★★★ <b>Works for me</b> I liked this wire because it strips nicely for attaching ferrules etc. Handy box to store the various colors where you see the color you need at a glance. Also VERY NICE velcro stay strips on each roll to keep wire from unspooling... Very flexible - strands don't seem to break like some wire....",
      "B09DSQ9YLC ★★★★★ <b>So far, so good...</b> This seems to be a good quality wire so far (it's not copper clad aluminum, thankfully), and the insulation was more flexible than I had counted on.

      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Assortment of colors makes it easy to keep circuits identifiable</b> This is a set of 6 different colors of tinned copper wire that came on individual spools. This is a great set to have on hand for use with projects that I will need to wire in the future. The colors of the silicone covering is easily visible and identify. I'm have not used wire with thus type of shielding before so I was skeptical. I opened one spool and put it to the test. I knew that tinned wire was easier to solder and offered less resistance and works great for wiring projects. What I didn't know was the silicone covering. After opening the spool I found the covering to be very flexible. It was more maneuverable the other wire I had worked with. It kind of felt like plastic and rubber blended together. It claimed it would withstand high heat and extreme cold. I used my lighter and it took a long time to melt the silicone. I then put the wire in the freezer and after freezing it was still very pliable. This set also came with different colored zip ties so if you need to keep different wires together in a group going to one place these come in handy. This is a great set to keep on hand and I'm sure you will be happy with every project you use them on. They offer so much more then other wire's I've used in the past",
      "B0B5DTDN64 ★★★★☆ <b>Good value for the money. Strips easy</b> Nice assortment of colors for making custom wire harnesses. Seems to be the correct gauge for most automotive connectors. I use copper clad for all my non-critical wiring like accessories and gauges. I probably would not use this wiring on my critical sensors since it is not pure copper. Happy to have this assortment on hand for quick hookups. Pair this with some nice braided loom and heat shrink tubing for professional looking wiring harnesses.",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★☆ <b>A nice assortment of wires</b> This is an assortment of wiring for various connections for hobby projects. The set comes in coils of colors such as yellow, white, blue, or black.",
      "B08FMGHSMY ★★★★☆ <b>Good wire</b> I’m happy with the color offerings this brand has in smaller gauges.",
      "B0CLHD8WR3 ★★★★★ <b>Good</b> Good variety of color, and all on their own spools. There was a cheaper option that had an additional color, but I chose this because they came on spools. Overall good quality",
      "B01M7NWX7A ★★★★★ <b>Nice soft wire, great for LEDs.</b> Very flexible, used to wire up LEDs in cosplay weapons. lots of colors to color code things.",
      "B01JM8J4TI ★★★★★ <b>Needed multiple colors for my project.</b> I used this wire for an automotive application. Insulation and wire quality seems good. I soldered and used heat shrink on my all off my connections, Everything works as it should, so that is what matters.",
      "B091GH5GT5 ★★★★★ <b>Great for antennas</b> This wire is flexible and the silicone insulation makes it slippery. I use it for portable antennas and it doesn't kink or tangle easily. The colors are great for making it visible or stealthy depending on your needs.",
      "B0C84BL61V ★★★★★ <b>Good quality wire</b> Exactly what you would expect from tinned copper wire. The wire is very pliable with thick insulation and well tinned to protect it from corrosion. There are plenty of colors to keep track of where each wire goes. Great option for wiring a small switch panel.",
      "B0CN2RB68V ★★★★★ <b>Handy selection for low voltage repairs</b> This Higoom 16 gauge electrical wire is great quality, well coated in very flexible stretchy silicone, and easy to strip to its core of evenly-tinned copper wires. The Higoom wire is particularly easy to handle, far easier to use in tight spaces than stiffer wires, and the tinned copper core makes it very simple to solder, too. Having six colors to choose from to match the color of a splice or repair in car or trailer wiring, along with the included short lengths of shrink tubing, means that 12-volt system repairs can be nearly invisible. The perforated dispensing box is a nice touch for anyone who does such work at a single work station, though I don't think I'll be using that feature. A really handy set of 16-gauge wire, and one that should last me a long time.",
      "B0BRN8DWTL ★★★★★ <b>Good quality attractive lamp cord.</b> This braided lamp cord is very attractive for hanging fixtures and restoring old table lamps. Several colors are available to choose from. Tape the ends to prevent the braided fiberglass from unraveling.",
      "B09CG2S2P2 ★★★★★ <b>Great assortment to have on hand</b> This is a great assortment of wire to have on hand for all sorts of projects. It'll give you plenty of colors to match what's there already, or to do your own color coding so things are easier to track down in the future,",
      "B088QJKKML ★★★★★ <b>As described</b> Had to rewire my POV for a new blue light. Needed, Red, Black, yellow, white, .green and blue. This bundle was perfect",
      "B01M4HDNLJ ★★★★★ <b>Good quality wire for all your DIY projects.</b> Good quality wire that is available in multiple colors. Makes it easier for wiring up DIY projects.",
      "B09X45RZCQ ★★★★★ <b>Luxurious and Colorful</b> If you've only ever used PVC covered wire, it's hard to understand just how luxurious silicone wire is to work with. Flexible, silky, pliant, satiny, velvety. All those terms apply to this product. The product came in a sturdy box that I'll probably keep the spools in. But the through-hole on the spools would make it easy to set these up on a rod in my shop. The wire was nicely wound, shrink-wrapped, and presented. I used DuPont connectors to make a bunch of jumper wires for breadboarding and they're a joy to work with. I love the color selections in this bundle.",
      "B0B5DTDN64 ★★★★★ <b>Good Value and Handy Set</b> While not as good as solid copper, this is a versatile set of 22 gauge wire spools that will come in handy. At this price point, it is certainly a good value and nice to have on hand. The six different colors are a nice variety and help to keep the project organized. Plus, having 100 feet of each, is a real convenience. I always hate coming up short and having to run out to get more. The vinyl casing strips cleanly even though it is a very small gauge. This helps a lot so that you don't lose any conductors. Overall, I am very happy with this wire set.",
      "B08FMGHSMY ★★★★★ <b>Love this wire!</b> Easiest wire ever to work with. Solders so easy and easy to strip. Like having all the colors available for custom hobbies.",
      "B08TB4BVV9 ★★★★★ <b>Attractive, sturdy, cloth covered lamp cord. Multiple colors available.</b> Disclaimer: I received this product for free through the Vine program. This round, cloth-covered lamp cord is nice and sturdy with a good heft and attractive woven Rayon cover. The wire is stranded copper, and the plug is solidly sealed over the cord with a reassuring UL imprint. I requested the silver-colored cord, which is shiny but has more of a pewter or gunmetal color to it. There are eleven other colors to choose from. I am pleased with this excellent product.",
      "B088QM242B ★★★★★ <b>Great quality wire</b> Used wire to rewire some travel trailer wiring that went bad. This was a great buy to get the colors and the size that we needed.",
      "B01KOEZ498 ★★★★★ <b>Great small gauge wire set!</b> Great small gauge wire set! I like the box setup which has openings for each color wire. It has been a good gauge wire for all applications in electronics for my modding and other soldering work.",
      "B0B5DTDN64 ★★★★★ <b>Great for guitar builders and other projects.</b> Wiring for guitars 🎸, colors are helpful.",
      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★★ <b>Nice wire</b> I can always locally find red and black wires, if I'm lucky, I can also find green. However, vehicle wiring comes in many many more colours. This kit is just what I needed. The box itself acts as a dispenser for the wires so you can keep every colour organised on its spool without it unwinding on you. My only issue with this design is, with the wire inside the box, you can't see how much you have left. With some colours, 16ft goes quickly. I absolutely enjoy the colour matching zip ties and heat shrink. I hate putting black heat shrink on coloured wire. Drives me crazy. When I first opened the box, I laughed at the wire stripper. I was going to bash it, but honestly, it's not bad. Works better and safer than me pushing wire between my thumb and pocket knife blade. The wire I show in the picture was stripped using the wire strippers provided. There are four different sized slots on the strippers for four different sized wires, but they aren't labelled, so be sure to double check before cutting in. The insulation on the wire is thick and flexible. The wire itself is flexible as well. I haven't noticed any issues quality control.",
      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Durable and the flexibility I was hoping for</b> I've got spools of normal hookup wire on my workbench, but I ran out of scrap lengths of silicone insulated wire and needed a useful assortment to keep on hand. This set of five colors on reels was perfect for what I needed. The flexibility is great and the stronger level of insulation against stray voltage is a big plus, as some of my projects involve vacuum tubes with voltages well above normal mains levels. For the total quantity, the price was reasonable... prices on wire have gone up, but this assortment was priced correctly in my opinion for the quality, gauge, and total length. It strips well and feels like it should last. I'm happy with the value, for sure.",
      "B0C6K5T8BW ★★★★★ <b>Good</b> Just right for wiring up a test board, soldering to a circuit board. Not as fancy as silicone insulated, but does the job, very easy to use, plenty of colors. Very happy with this solid (not stranded) wire that stays in place when you bend it, is not too thick or too thin.",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Nice flexible wire with good insulation. Glad to have it in my inventory.</b> This is really nice 20 gauge wire with excellent insulation and flexibility. Each of the 6 spools holds 50' of tinned copper wire for a total of 300'. Each strand of the 20 gauge twisted wire has been tinned before the wire was twisted and insulated in colored silicone but the ends should be tinned again before soldering to a terminal to provide the best solder connection. The insulation is easy to strip with a standard pair of wire strippers and the wire tins and solders well. I'm giving it 5 stars because it is quality wire at a good price and it is a welcome addition to my electronics repair supplies.",
      "B0746HG158 ★★★★★ <b>It's cable</b> The colors of the individual wires aren't nearly as vibrant as they are in the product photo, but I am able to work with them in my wire stripper, so, small victories. Very flexible, too.",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Nice assortment and a quality box. True tinned OFC.</b> Wire measures true to gauge and the coating is nice and flexible. Ohms out and appears to be tinned OFC as advertised. I despise anything CCA and these pass all my tests. Box is also a high enough quality that it will serve it's purpose as a dispenser. That may sound silly, but I;ve bought a couple sets with crummy boxes and it's a pain when they fall apart. I go through a ton of 14/16/18 wire for my projects and will check on this brand's other offerings next time I'm in need.",
      "B0CN2RB68V ★★★★★ <b>Great pack for various projects!</b> Large wire great for higher amp (maybe 10 or so?) projects. Very flexible (though you wont get it to bend to a set shape is the trade ofc). Stranded is excellent! Good colors. Insulation is easy to strip. No issues or rust noted on the metal inside.",
      "B0C6K5T8BW ★★★★★ <b>8 colors! Including Red/Black striped</b> This is exactly what I needed for my color coded wiring. Much easier to troubleshoot & maintain.",
      "B0BWY3JGGV ★★★★★ <b>Good kit for when you need wire for your project</b> I really like the value of this kit. I was not expecting the included colored shrink wrap so that was a nice bonus. The wire stripper works for the most part but you really should have some good wire strippers when doing your projects anyway. The box holds everything nice when you need to store it for later. Good quality wire and insulation.",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>Good selection of wire colors for electronic work</b> Good size and color selection for electric / electronic hobbyist like me. I really like the silicone outer sheath. It's heat resistant and very flexible. Great little kit. I like it.",
      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★★ <b>Handy wire dispenser.</b> This collection may not be the cheapest way to purchase 18 gauge wire but it certainly qualifies as the handiest. The eight spools of wire lay flat in the provided box and rotate as you pull wire through the eight small exit holes cut in the box. Not only is the wire easy to pull and use but the spools are very neat and tidy for quick storage. I build small electric vehicles (e-bike, trikes, scooter, ride on toys ) and the availability of 8 colors makes wiring far easier to track and identify. Nice little kit for the hobby builder/maker.",
      "B088QM242B ★★★★★ <b>great value</b> great amount of wire and colors for the price.",
      "B01M7NWX7A ★★★★★ <b>Great for modding</b> I used these wires to install 4 Raspberry Pi Pico units into 4 separate GameCubes. The wire is nice and strong but can easily fit into tight spaces and withstand being clamped lightly between two screwed in parts. Continuity was never an issue and the amount of colors and cable provided means I get to use these for a while. The casing is also very good against heat (I've had some bundles of wire that burn in the past) and withstood even excessive soldering time per wire Very happy :)",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Good flexible wire</b> These spools of wire are great. They're soft, not stiff, and they do appear to be 22 gauge. There should be 6o feet of wire on each of the 6 spools and as far as I can tell it does seem to be the case. The wire is stranded and takes solder well. Definitely deserves a 5 star rating and I recommend it!",
      "B0CLBHT8YX ★★★★★ <b>Great Value for Basic Wiring Projects</b> This Iron Forge Cable 20 Gauge Wire assortment pack is perfect for having a variety of colors on hand for basic wiring projects. The 50ft rolls provide ample length, and the stranded copper clad aluminum wire is easy to work with.",
      "B0C84BL61V ★★★★★ <b>Cute Little Spools of Wire</b> Six neatly-packed little spools of stranded, copper wire all ready for those special repair projects. For some reason, I thought the spools would be bigger, but 20 ft is 20 ft. As a bonus, each spool is labeled with it's gauge, temperature and voltage rating.",
      "B09CG2S2P2 ★★★★★ <b>great wire set</b> I'm doing a ton of wiring work on a classic car and this set has been a godsend. Love the choices of colors, and the wire is made well and have had no issues. This has allowed me to not only repair the car's wiring, keeping colors as organized as possible but has also allowed me to modify the wiring as I have needed to. This is easy to work with and has worked great for me.",
      "B088QM6SHH ★★★★★ <b>Good color combination</b> There is value for the money. Wire is a good size and flexible without worrying about breaking. Colors are highly visible and I can stay close to my wiring diagram without rechaising wires.",
      "B09CG2S2P2 ★★★★★ <b>Good Collection To Keep Automotive Wires Sorted</b> Don't be that guy (or girl) who wires everything in red and black. Staying organized means color coding cables. These work. It's a good universal gauge. I used them to wire up pod lights on my front bumper. To keep the rolls organized: The opening is big enough to fit over a 3/4 conduit pipe. I pulled a paracord through it and have it hanging from wall above my work bench. So thumbs up for a good product.",
      "B07TFF9FTM ★★★★☆ <b>gauge size seams accurate, insulation a little larger than I expected</b> Schools of wire coming a box that also can be set up to function as a dispenser. The wire gauge size seems accurate and fits snuggly in my breadboards. Only thing I noticed is the insulation coating is a little thicker than I expected. I'm using it to do Arduino prototyping and often or run wires underneath things plugged into the breadboard and the extra thickness of the insulation tends to take up valuable space so I can't get as many wires as I used to. It's a small challenge and I may look around it other brands but overall it's a good value for the variety of colors and the fact that the wire looks like it's tinned copper. I should mention that if you're going to solder this, the insulation does look like PVC and it will melt fairly quickly, so do your soldering quickly and at lower temperatures. I use a 384° solder on a temperature adjustable weller and I haven't had an issue. If you're using a cheaper soldering iron that doesn't have real temperature control you're going to have a harder time keeping the insulation from melting",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Practical kit for small wiring jobs</b> This is a convenient set of wire for small automotive or hobby projects. The wire is tinned copper, and I exposed the copper with a grinder to be sure of the copper. The tinning makes the actual wire appear silver and protects against corrosion. Very flexible and finely stranded, so it is easy to pull and route where needed and various colors for identification according to your needs. 14 gauge is typical for 15 amps or less in relatively short distances like a vehicle, and the silicone insulation is both durable and well suited for applications where moisture, oils or dirt may be encountered. Also comes with an assortment of wire ties. Note that this is not manufactured or or suitable for use in house wiring, nor is it UL Listed. Overall, a nice selection of quality wire at a reasonable price.",
      "B071L37BR2 ★★★★★ <b>Get WIRED!</b> Once I tried this wire I was hooked! I have used this type and brand of wire for making antennas and have been extremely satisfied with the results.

Each strand is pre-tinned so even 12-gauge wire is extremely flexible. I use a lot of crimp lugs in my work and this wire is great for what I do. I really like that I don't have to spend the time tinning now. I create industrial art pieces and often need very flexible wire. I'll include a picture of one of my unfinished pieces. I couldn't be happier with this wire. If any of them ever fail over time, I'll come back and update this post.",
      "B01M7NWX7A ★★★★★ <b>Works great!</b> The fan I was installing came with enough wiring for a semi-flush mount: about 10”. I had a 6’ downrod. Ordered this kit mid-installation and had it the next day and it exceeded expectations. The wire sheathing is good quality and stripped cleanly. It was very easy to connect with butt connectors to the fan wiring. Comes with every color under the sun and then some. I have enough leftover for another fan installation.",
      "B01M7NWX7A ★★★★★ <b>High flexability- just what I needed</b> I bought these to repair our freezer door wiring. There was a stress point at the hinge that fatigued the factory wires and caused the ice maker to stop working intermittently. This was a perfect fit. I spliced in 9 pieces of wire into the wiring harness and removed the fatigued section of original wires. The high count stranding should hold up well to this type of fatigue. Having ten colors was great too. Overall very happy with this purchase, and I have some leftover for other applications. Delivery was timely, about 2 days with Amazon Prime.",
      "B0B3H27JG2 ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Ich finde die Silikonkabel sind zu dick, nicht wirklich geschmeidig und zu teuer!</b> Ich war auf der Suche nach geschmeidigen und angenehmen Silikonkabeln. Verglichen mit anderen feinstdrähtigen (nicht feindrähtigen!) Kabel sind diese Silikonkabel bei gleichem Nennquerschnitt deutlich dicker, da der Mantel dicker ist. Trotz des dicken Mantels finde ich sie allerdings nicht wirklich schlitzfester. Das zu den Kabeln mitgelieferte Zubehör ist für mich nicht zu gebrauchen. Da ich mit diesen Kabel so unzufrieden bin, habe ich mir umgehend Ersatz besorgt und werde nur im Ausnahmefall auf diese Kabel zurückgreifen, wenn meine Markenware aufgebraucht ist.

It's GREAT to have multiple colors for different projects and for keeping your wiring nice and organized. The pricing seems to be in-line with what you can get at local stores and from other sellers, so no issues there. And just in case, I've confirmed this is 22 gauge wire. You're welcome. :) I'm using this wire for a variety of 5v and 12v hobby projects, with both soldering and crimping on different wire terminals. Each has been successful so far and the wire was very nice to work with. I'm happy with this wire and excited to use in many projects to come!",
      "B01JM8J4TI ★★★★★ <b>A rainbow of colors - rewired a 20' boat trailer</b> The wire was perfect for my application (boat trailer). I had not trouble with stripping or hookup. I soldered every connection and applied a double layer of shrink wrap. I had no trouble with soldering even though the wire was stranded copper and not tin coated. Just a matter of using solder with flux core in it. About the only thing I wish was different was that most 4-wire boat harnesses use BROWN as the running light feed color, and this set did not include that color. No big deal, I just switched to BLUE.",
      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★☆ <b>Reasonable price - Works well</b> I do a lot of wiring around my place for various sensors I build to bring data, and control regarding our various animals and greenhouses into our smart home system. So I gave this set a try and it's not disappointing. All the spools have held the right amount of length. The gauge measures accurate against the calipers, it's stranded copper not aluminum which is reassuring. The wire is flexible for position sometimes inside tiny sensor boxes, but still well enough coated that I'm not worried in a few places where the wire is under cover but technically exposed to the elements. It comes in at 0.18$ a foot right now which isn't bad for a good selection of project wire but if you don't need 6 colors then just look at picking up the single color wires which can come in around 0.15$",
      "B06Y58W228 ★★★★★ <b>Great quality all around 20GA wire</b> love that you have different colors in the package, works great and the wires are very flexible and good quality for the price.",
      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Nice design</b> This product has proven to be an excellent choice for my electrical projects, offering several key features that make it stand out from other wires on the market. The use of tinned copper wire is a significant advantage of this silicone wire. The tin layer serves as a protective barrier for the inner oxygen-free copper, preventing it from being oxidized. This feature enhances the wire's longevity and ensures consistent performance over time, even in demanding conditions. The soft silicone insulator on this wire makes it highly flexible, making it easy to handle and maneuver during installations. This flexibility is a real benefit when working in tight spaces or intricate electrical setups, as it allows for smooth routing and minimizes the risk of wire kinking or damage. The availability of six different colors in the spools is a practical and thoughtful feature. It makes it easy to distinguish between wires and simplifies identification in complex wiring configurations. This color-coding system has been invaluable in my projects, enabling me to work more efficiently and avoid any potential wiring errors. With its rating for all under 600V devices and a rated current of 12A, this silicone wire is suitable for a wide range of applications. Whether it's low-voltage electronic projects, DIY circuits, or even some home appliances, this wire can handle the task with ease and reliability.",

This is a good collection of wires for a variety of uses, and I’ve already used a bunch for running lights to the bumper and A pillars. The wires are thick enough to handle heavy loads on good size lights but small enough to tuck behind rubber trim or interior panels. The colors are a good mix to keep wires organized and can somewhat match the factory aux switch lines. I use a torch and heat shrink on all of my wiring, and the insulation on these wires has no problem and doesn’t get scorched at all while I’m working close to it. The insulation is soft and so far hasn’t become brittle at all, even wiring in the engine bay. Overall a good choice for automotive wiring.",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Extra flexible lite gauge wire</b> So this wire is everything it says it is it has a tinned copper core with the newer style high temp silicone jacket if your not familiar with the silicone insulation jacket the biggest difference is it is much more flexible than traditional insulating materials an by more I mean alot more this stuff bends with no bounce back but will easily straighten back out if necessary it also claims to have a higher temperature resistance which was easy to prove using a lighter to strip one end it definitely took alot more time an direct flame before it was hot enough to strip compared to traditional covering it also came with 6 different colors on nice sturdy plastic spools as stated an it also came with small some zip ties to secure wires so overall I think the slightly higher price of this wire is definitely worth it if extra flexibility is nessacary for what you are using it for I also believe the higher temperature resistance is a big plus to protect your expensive electronics an this set has 6 different colors to choose from making it easy to color code multiple curcuits an the tinned copper core is more conductive, holds up longer an makes it easier to solder",

Easy to use for ... well, everything you'd want to use wire this size for. I do lots of electronics tinkering, maker stuff, lighting in my workshop, various Halloween electronics / animatronics, audio applications, appliance repairs. This is useful for me for all of these things, where stranded wire works with the application. You've probably got plenty of other stuff you'll use it for. Strips cleanly.

The insulation is thick and won't easily split. The stranded wire is very flexible and easy to strip off. Comes in 10 colors each on a seperate reel. Once you remove the shrinkwrap, the wire does tend to want to unwind off the spool, but such is the nature of this wire. The only regret I have is that I was not offered a choice of colors. I would have much preferred to have a spool of Gray wire over Pink for example.",

      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★★ <b>Great stuff! 6 coils, more than enough for multiple small projects, nice insulator. Works great!</b> I do a lot of small projects, usually LED and battery stuff, but sometimes repairs and prototyping too. This is GREAT stuff to have laying around for low-voltage work. This should carry anywhere from 14 to 22+ amps of current, depending on the temperature you are comfortable running at. While the silicone insulator may be good up to 200ºC, I'd probably stay below 90ºC (194ºF). At 600 volts, this could deliver 8.4kW up to 13.2kW of power, depending on your sensitivity for temperature! But at 12 volts, more like 168 watts. Or 48 volts, 672 watts. Fun stuff, electricity! This has been great to have around while building out USB-C PD devices to run everything in my house but small appliances off of USB-C PD 3.0 and 3.1. I built my own 4S LiPO battery pack with this stuff too! For the price, and free Prime delivery, this is great stuff.",

I'm used to my other wire kit that really only provided a few options so this was a huge upgrade in terms of my ability to make my projects clearer from a visual perspective. I really like that this came with a bunch of prototyping PCB breadboards and 2 normal solderless breadboards. I have a bunch of the latter already from collecting them over the years but only have a very PCB ones that I've specifically bought and usually end up going through them a lot faster as I solder things to them making removal tedious. I like that not only have they given me some nice wires but they gave me a starting point for my next projects! Would recommend this set -- the wires feel the same (to me) as any other I've purchased previously at this AWG but they give more variety.",

      "B07198ZF3S ★★★★★ <b>For HF antenna wire</b> This wire is very lightweight which is what I wanted. It has almost no memory so it rarely kinks or tangles (if wound neatly). I use it for EFHW and 1/4 wave verticals as well as radials when needed. Handles 100 watts SSB. I like the yellow for high visibility. Comes in many colors. ITS A GOOD VALUE. Recommended.",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Great quality automotive & marine wire</b> This is perfect wire for automotive use, including campers and marine applications. The conductors are fine stranded, tinned copper, which is a thin protective coating on the copper to keep it from corroding in harsh environments such as ocean areas, or auto applications where winter road salting can cause problems. Despite what other reviewers have said, this is indeed copper wire, but the “tinning” process makes the wire appear silver unless you look at the cut end. It is typically used with crimp connectors in most applications. There is no indication that this wire is UL listed, so I would not use it for home-wiring applications or any 120 volt (or higher) AC current. The silicone insulation and fine stranding make this wire very flexible, so perfect for sharp turns and pulling through tight locations like behind the dash. The 14 gauge that I used is good for any circuits of up to 10 amps unless they are longer than 25 feet or so. Remember to calculate for both positive and negative lengths, and whether you can afford any voltage drop in your circuit. Circuits for an automotive refrigerator or fog lamps, which have extended use times for example, are different than a circuit for a horn, which is only used for a couple seconds at a time. This seems to be a very good quality and well manufactured wire, and is available in a wide variety of gauges, both red and black.",
      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Good Quality</b> I got the 12 gauge to have on hand when I need some clean good quality wire for repairs. Nice to get the assortment of colors, the wire gauge is as expected and the silicone wrapping is a bonus. Very happy with this product.",
      "B0B5DTDN64 ★★★★★ <b>Good quality hobby wire</b> What's to be said about wire? The insulation strips off easily, the strands are easy to twist together to ensure you don't get random strands going where you don't want them. The wire takes solder well. It'd be nice if it was pure copper, but for 99% of low voltage wiring, it will work just fine. Nice to have an assortment of colors. Overall its pretty great.",
      "B01M7NWX7A ★★★★★ <b>Awesome flexible wire</b> This wire is great, multiple colors allow me to trace the wiring from start to finish. Each switch gets it's own colors, this makes things easy especially when wiring into a relay panel first. Insulation is soft and flexible and accepts crimped terminals well. I Just wish I would have purchased the lower gauge wire at the same time, I'd be done by now.",
      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★★ <b>Great Hobbyist Kit for Arduino/Control Systems</b> I think this kit is useful for arduino or control system projects, where it may be confusing to only see red/black wires everywhere. It makes it less painful to trace wires to their appropriate I/O (e.g. motors, buttons, etc). The box having holes for each spool is a creative touch that makes it trivial to pull out wire without having to actually open the box. The additional wire stripper was unnecessary to add, but a nice touch for hobbyists who might not have a lot of equipment. It takes a few attempts to figure out the right technique for stripping the wire, but it is definitely usable in place of a dedicated wire stripper. The wire itself was as-advertised and the high voltage and amperage rating makes this suitable for almost all use cases (beyond excessive power delivery).",
      "B01LWI20M0 ★★★★★ <b>Good quality</b> Nice to have so many colors to better distinguish where the wires go. Real copper",
      "B01K4RPB3O ★★★★★ <b>Works Great!</b> Good quality wire. Much better than typical PVC wire. It strips very easily and cleanly and because the insulation is silicone rubber, it doesn’t melt when soldering or deform when using heat-shrink. Very flexible and easy to work with. I use it for wiring the electronics when building or modifying electric guitars and use four different colors – black for ground, white for hot, and gray and red for jumpers. Very happy with this wire. Tiny zip-ties help to keep the wires organized and where you want them.",
      "B07G2BWBX8 ★★★★★ <b>Good Stuff</b> Good solid core copper wire. Not much to say about it. Not cheap junk, comes with plenty of feet and plenty of colors. Be sure to get pvc insulation, the silicone insulation feels a little flimsy to me.",

I am handy myself, but hubby normally gets to have the fun of using these type of gadgets. I was so pleased with them, that I asked if we needed more for the rest of the build, yep already ordered. Let's put it this way, using the old method with wire nuts involved mumbling, grumbling and sailor language (yep we were sailors), and at least 15 min per light... with these level nuts, prep the fixture, less than a minute, not one curse, then up the ladder to the overhead, insert the mounting screws into the box, insert the wiring into the level nut slot, and snap! Verify that the wires are secure, and it's all over except I have to clean the fixture globes! Would I recommend these? Oh yeah! Note: Hubby prefers the gray ones over the clear ones. I have no idea why, but after that super smooth mission, who am I to question a good thing?",

      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>A spendy option for some quality wire</b> I like this wire. Very flexible yet not a problem to run. I used this to rewire an overhead barn light with new wire through the conduit into the light. Easy to handle, great flexibility with decent abrasion resistance too. It's nice to have 5 colors to work with if you're dealing with multiple circuits, and its kept tidy on the small spools. Certainly not the cheapest option at $6/20' roll, but all wire is expensive right now with copper being so high.

I don't know if this is a thousand feet total or a thousand feet per color or 250 meters either way... and I don't care because it's more wire than I'm likely to consume in my lifetime, doing point-to-point wiring on tiny cigarette-pack-sided circuit boards. It may be PCV, but it strips exactly like Tefzel does and as far as I can tell it would be entirely suitable for use wire-wrapping, especially if you solder your wraps like you really should if you're confident in your schematic. This wire is less likely to tarnish than standard silver-plated wire-wrap wire. It's just the right size for data-level or small-signal connections to transistors and ICs, which move very little current and cannot overheat #30 wire. Any smaller and it would be difficult to work with. Plan your project carefully, so that you never need to solder immediately adjacent to the insulation... because this insulation will absolutely not tolerate soldering temperatures like Tefzel will.",

The wire itself is very fine stranded, which makes soldering a joy. The silicone jacket is very easy to strip and the colors are unique enough to be easy to spot in a complex hand wired harness. This wire is rated at 600V, which means it is o.k. for use in most vacuum tube amplifiers (not HAM stuff, but audio stuff, where voltages don't often exceed 600VDC.) I do wish the manufacturer offered a 17 color version, or a striped version, as ten colors rapidly runs out. Other than that, a nice bunch of wire. I'll be using it again. 20 gauge is real nice for point to point vacuum tube amp work. Five stars. wish it had more colors. Also, missing gray...which is a mystery to me...but still five stars.",

The conductors are tinned copper (not copper coated aluminum) as described and there are a large number of individual conductors - helping considerably to make the wire as flexible as it is. The insulation appears and feels to be silicone (also as described). The colors are also vibrant as in the description. One nice feature is that each spool of wire is individually labelled - so once these leave their original box and I pick up a spool in 6 months I won't be wondering whether the wire is 14, 16 or 18 AWG - the spool is clearly labeled 16AWG.

This 6 pack became available on Vine so I decided to get it as it will probably last me a very long time being as each roll is 100'. The wire seems to be pretty decent. It is copper clad aluminum which isn't the best according to some but for automotive applications I've found it to be perfectly acceptable. This shouldn't be used in residential applications and the manufacturer notes it right on its ad, but for other less critical projects will be fine.

I only have two issues with this and would probbaly have dinged a 1/2 star if that was an option: I measured one of the rolls to see if I was getting 20ft, and it came up about 4 inches short. This isn't too bad for 20ft, but I expect to get every inch I paid for. Now maybe some of the other rolls were longer, but I didn't verify. If that is the case then they need to be more consistant. The second issue involves using the box as a \"dispenser\". THere are holes in the back of the box to feed the wire. The problem is if you put all 6 spools in side by side, then there isn't enough room to close the lid or for the spools to spin. They came packed with the spools in a 2x3 configuration instead of the 1x6 configuration you would use for dispensing. This is because they don't fit otherwise. Looks like good wire. So if you dn't mind being shorted a couple of inches, and don't need the dispenser to work well with 6 rolls of wire, and otherwise this is a good value for you, then this is your product. Oh yeah, it comes with some colored zip ties. <shrug> Price as reviewed $32.99 NAOEVO 16 Gauge Wire 120ft, 16 AWG Silicone Wire 20ft Each Spool, 6 Colors Flexible Tinned Copper Wire Electrical Wire 16 Gauge, Hookup Wire Kit for Breadboard/Automotive/DIY/Battery, 200℃ 600V",

      "B01M8F9ZVX ★★★★★ <b>Flexible and great for 3D printer supplies</b> I have purchased this flexible silicone wire many times and it has not ever disappointed me. I enjoy using it each time I start a new 3D printer build and go to wire up DC supply outputs. The flexibility allows me to route the wires wherever I need. Usually this is between the frame rails of the printer, for running power from the supply to either the controller board or MOSFETS that I use to power my heat bed and hot end. I usually crimp and soldier all my connectors. For me, this wire has never had any troubles wicking up the soldier. So, by doing both I get a solid bond that I never have to worry about. The three-foot piece of each color is enough for each of my projects.",

      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Really nice wire</b> As a DIYer and Handyman, I frequently find myself in need of various lengths of wire for projects and repairs. Since it's often useful to color code different connections, this five-color pack of 16 ga wire from Fipnot is good to have on hand. The package includes five spools of very nice quality wire with five different color insulation used. Each spool has 20 feet of wire. I really like the insulation on this wire. It's a soft silicone vs vinyl which I most often used in the past. This gives the wire great flexibility, as well as heat and abrasion resistance. The most commonly used red and black (for positive and negative DC wiring) are represented, as well as white, blue, and yellow. The wire consists of (according to the ad) 252 individual tiny strands of tinned copper wire. I didn't order this pack for any particular purpose in mind, but rather to have on hand when needed. Good to know that when the need comes up I'll have it \"in stock\" rather than having to run to a hardware store of home center!",

The wire is tinned copper and I had no issues with its conductivity. Having a few spools that are color coded helped me wire in some additional lighting and keeping the left, right, front and back color coded. The coating is good and the wire met the expectations that I had for the product. Make sure you are choosing the right gauge for your applications and I think this wire will work great for you. I think the price is fair for the quality and quantity that you get. Overall, I am happy with the wire and would purchase again when I need more.",

      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>Handy wire kit</b> With the many various projects I'm doing for one reason or another, it's nice to have various colors of wire around. The 18 gauge is good for smaller, low current circuits. I really like that the box itself is a dispenser, that way I won't have to worry about keeping track of all the spools and worrying about them unwinding themselves while being moved around in a drawer or something. The wire itself is aluminum, so not the highest quality, but it only needs to carry a little power, I wouldn't use this for signal wire that can't tolerate noise (speakers, sensitive control circuits, etc.). The insulation is rubberized and very flexible. It makes it a little more difficult to strip, but will protect it better from sharp edges so it's worth it. The included color matched shrink tubing and zip ties are a good touch too.",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>Keep it Colorful!</b> I decided to go with these wire becase of the assorted colors. Most often, I only use red/black wires. Usually, that is all I need, but there are times when I would like to match the wiring of whatever circuit I am working on for easy identification. These wires are flexible, which work well in cramped projects. I mainly do LED projects so I went with the 18 AWG kit. It's cool that they have the little stripper and het shrink tubes, but I have tons of tubing and prefer to use my own strippers. However, it is great for someone just getting started or have very little tools etc. All-in-all, I like the wire kit for occasional use and I am very satisfied!",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>A Comprehensive Starter Set for Electronics Enthusiasts</b> The 18 Gauge Wire Kit offers an excellent starting point for anyone delving into the realm of electronics, whether as a hobbyist or a budding professional. This kit is particularly appealing for its thoughtful compilation of essential wiring needs, presented in a user-friendly package. Variety and Quality: One of the standout features of this kit is the variety it offers—eight colors of 18 gauge silicone wire, each extending to 23 feet (7 meters). While the length of each spool might not cater to extensive projects, the assortment allows for ample experimentation and small-scale builds. The choice of silicone for the wire sheathing is a commendable one, providing a durable, heat-resistant covering that forgives the occasional soldering mishap, making it an ideal selection for beginners. Additionally, silicone's chemical resistance and flexibility are qualities that veteran electronics enthusiasts will appreciate. Accessories and Utility: The inclusion of color-coordinated heat shrink tubing and zip ties adds a layer of organization and professionalism to projects, enhancing the overall utility of the kit. While the wire stripper may not impress seasoned users, it's a valuable addition for those just starting, offering an all-in-one solution to basic wiring needs. Packaging and Design: The kit's packaging is notably well-conceived, featuring a box with holes for each wire spool, facilitating easy access and storage. This system helps maintain a clean and organized workspace, a boon for any project. However, the opportunity for improvement lies in the visibility of the remaining wire on each spool; a clear plastic window on the box would have perfectly rounded out the design by allowing users to gauge their wire stock at a glance. Conclusion: In summary, the 18 Gauge Wire Kit earns a solid five-star rating not through groundbreaking innovation but through the thoughtful assembly of high-quality components tailored to meet the needs of both novice and experienced electronics enthusiasts. It stands out as a comprehensive and practical kit, perfect for anyone looking to embark on or expand their electronics projects with a reliable selection of wires and tools at their disposal.",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>Very Nice Assortment</b> Really nice assortment of 18ga wire. Easy to work with and solders great. I do a lot of electronic projects and work on electric guitars. Seems I'm always looking for the right piece of wire. This is great because of the color assortment. The little wire stripper, shrink tubing, and zip ties make for a nice neat project. This set is a pretty good value for what you get. Much less than primary wire at the parts store."

It has a nice easy to feel ridge marking on one conductor for polarity identification but be careful to be consistent about using that tactile key, because the other conductor has white printed data, and it would be easy to confuse the issue. 16 gauge might be a bit small for some uses with landscaping lights, especially if you have lots of halogens, or long runs. My initial use is to run power to a weather station which doesn't draw too much power, but I can also see this being used for speakers."

      "B07TFF9FTM ★★★★★ <b>Ultra flexible wire, 200C, great value!</b> Very happy with this wire set -- great value, and it's what the listing says it is. Be sure you know what you're buying. This is ultra flexible, with many super-fine strands and silicone rubber insulation marked 200C (higher than PVC but lower than PTFE). The fine strands (150 of them, but I didn't count!) can be a bit of a challenge when crimping contacts... make sure no microscopic strands escape the crimp -- then it works great. The insulation is thick but soft: very easy to work with but also easily damaged if used in the wrong application. It's the right cable for routing in tight locations, since it's so willing to bend and lay flat... good for DIY drones (flexing arms or retracting legs) or making wiring harnesses that need to flex but are well protected from abrasion and pinching. For more rugged high-temp insulation, consider PTFE but it is much more difficult to work with and hard to find at a reasonable price. As noted by others, some colors are a bit off. Red is clearly orange, and blue is gray-purple. That's okay for my purposes, but maybe not if you are building to a print for assemblies that will be inspected. The velcro wraps keep each spool neat, and the box is good for organizing these spools when lots of other wire spools are around.",

It is hard to see from the cut end and when I do get a bit of copper color I am not sure if it is a reflection. I scraped the tinning off from the sides and got a little pale pinkish color. Maybe it is just that the strand count is so high (small strands) or that the copper is of a different purity than what I am used to seeing.

There are small holes on both sides where you can feed the wires through to act as dispensers. One side is under the lid, so the wire ends are held under the lid when not in use. The other side is opposite so you can keep the lid closed and be able to pull wire out. It also comes with a small pack of heat shrink tubing in the same colors as the wires.

You see, buried PVC conduit is pretty much guaranteed to fill with water at some point, and I have come back years later to a water-filled conduit with this pull line in it and was able to pull it through without issue. What I do, though, is when I find the conduit filled with water I will actually using the existing pull line to pull through this as new pull line and THEN use the new line to pull the actual conductors, as I'm just not going to risk a break from it soaking for years :) But when I pull out the old line, it certainly LOOKS perfectly fine, so their claim of mildew/rot proof seems to be correct from my experience with this line. Don't be alarmed if the line is black instead of the blue in the product photos... it's the right product. Not sure why the product photos show blue, as even in big box stores it's black not blue. I'll end this with a tip for those who may not know: take a common plastic shopping bag, tie the pull line to the shopping bag, stuff it in the conduit and use a shop vac on the other end to pull it though. Then use the poly pull line to pull your conductors.",

As awful as that can be, having this kit to keep wires separated while also allowing continuous easy access to fresh wire is as good of a helping hand as you are going to get, aside from a good wiring diagram. The wire is of good quality and it stays neatly spooled up on the rolls. Hopefully this roll will last me quite a while but if need be I would buy this item again.",
      "B0B15DXZHJ ★★★★★ <b>Excellent little set for the money.</b> Item arrived on time. Well packaged. Just as specified in description. The box turns into a handy dispenser for the wire so to speak with each hole color coded for the wire coming out. Came with snack cutter and some color coated heat shrink. Perfect to keep on the work bench for general wiring needs. Would buy again.",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>A Good Selection of Hook-Up wire for any DIYer.</b> As a long time electronics hobbyist, I’m always in need of hook-up wire in many colors, so I usually have to resort to pulling apart old multi-conductor cables to find the right wire for my many projects. This kit makes that so much easier! The wire is high quality tinned copper with a thick silicone insulation that can withstand high voltage and temperature. The wire itself takes solder beautifully, the insulation doesn’t melt when soldering, and it is flexible enough to be used in most situations. The kit also includes some color matched heat-shrink tubing, small zip-ties, and a mini wire stripper. You can keep the wire spools in the box and pull out small lengths as needed or add them to your spool holder like I did (see photo). This wire kit is an excellent choice for any DIY hobbyist who appreciates having a selection of high quality wire on hand for their projects. It’s a bit pricy, so the hobbyist themselves may not seek it out, but it certainly would make an excellent gift that they would definitely appreciate receiving.",

The eight little spools of wire Come in A box with eight holes around the edges that theoretically would allow you to dispense the wire without opening the box. The box is designed so that the spools lay on their sides. Four wires come out of each side. This means you can't leave the box on the shelf and just pull out the wire you want. I would have preferred to see these spools organized on edge where all eight spools could be accessed from just one side of the box. Aside from the box, the wire itself is very good.",

Giant bright blue and red wire nuts really stand out in an undesirable way in a landscape bed. Secondly, it is hard to shop for these, colors seems to correspond to size but what size do I need? The information presented is minimal, just a comma delimited list of wire size+count options.

This wire (#22) has insulation that is slightly thicker than some PVC insulations but not a lot thicker. Its easy to strip the insulation but its not so soft that it tears or can be crushed off the wire easily - I've had silicone insulation that was just to fragile and this is perfect - The slightly tougher insulation is slightly stiffer but its a much better compromise for applications where the wiring won't be completely protected in a sleeve - even inside an enclosure, some of them are too easily damaged and this holds up well. Colors are very solid/bright - no issues there The conductor is very finely stranded and individually tinned strands - very nice construction and easy to work with.

      "B09CG2S2P2 ★★★★☆ <b>Great Lightweight Wire</b> This Cablectric 4 Roll 12 Gauge Copper Clad Aluminum Primary Wire came in four bright colors. It is lightweight and doesn't qualify for use as the wiring in a house and isn't rated to be used outdoors. I wonder why they say it is good for marine usage if it can't be used outdoors. All I can figure is it may be used if concealed from the weather, such as under the sides of a boat or inside a houseboat. It wouldn't be acceptable for a boat trailer, however, as the wires are exposed to the elements there. We chose to use the wire for the new speaker system for our television. My adult son and I live together and he wired the speakers. He said it was very easy with this wire as it stripped easily and didn't break any when he wrapped the ends around the terminals. I have to take his word for this as I certainly don't know anything about it!! Next, he plans to rewire the LED lights under our countertops. They don't carry enough current to count as house wiring. All in all, this is great wire for general use. It is nice to have available for things that may pop up. Who knows, I may have a need for some brightly colored wire for a craft project, too!! At this writing, it is only about $30 for 100 feet of wire, so it is very reasonable. I do recommend it!!",

The insulation appears and feels to be silicone (also as described). The colors are also vibrant as in the description. One nice feature is that each spool of wire is individually labelled - so once these leave their original box and I pick up a spool in 6 months I won't be wondering whether the wire is 14, 16 or 18 AWG - the spool is clearly labeled 16AWG.

The installation took place while the ambient temperature was in the mid-40s, so I thought I'd have an issue with stiff insulation curl; that was happily not the case. I also used a clip style couplers with small blades that needed to pierce the insulation to make contact with the wire's copper. That also was not an issue and every connection worked perfectly the first time out. The wire has a smooth side and a ridged side, for proper identification. It's easy to see the difference visually, but maybe not by touch. The price was right when compared with the home improvement store (orange is their color). Besides, I'd rather have home delivery during this pandemic than have to go into a store where a lot of sub-contractors aren't wearing masks. You make that decision for yourself.",

I spent yesterday removing the old wiring and installing this YOTIGER wiring... that was a job. This is nice wire... pure copper, not cheap copper clad aluminum. It is UL listed and is rated for underground burial. It is very flexible, but the sheathing seems fairly durable. This wire could also be used for other applications like speaker wiring.

I have bought other vendor's cable that could be separated with my bare hands. This shortcoming from this wire added several minutes to each light. While not important for outdoor lighting, it does have identifying ribs on one wire strand to help you keep your polarity straight (if actually needed).",

The outer insulating jacket is thick PVC (I used the 12awg notch of my stripper to strip it). Perfect for landscape lights or general DIY project wire. It bonded wire but easy to seperate the conductors. One is stamped with the wire specs, the other is ridged for easy polarity identification. Accepts crimps and soldering well. I'm currently working on wiring 4 20-watt solar panels together in parallel with this wire. Should be good to make low current draw expension cords, too.

I installed both the plug and socket slide on connectors without any difficulty. I did use a large pair of pliers to fully seat the cover of each connector. Tip: One side of the wire has a raised ridge. I aligned this side with the wider polarized plug/socket on the slide on connectors to ensure polarity was maintained at each connector. This is an important electrical safety feature that should be followed. Recently an ice storm interrupted power at my house for two days. My portable generator was able to provide electricity for only some parts of the house. The Wi-Fi router what is across the house and the outlets serving it did not have power. I used this extension cord at it’s full 50 foot length to run electricity from an energized outlet to my Wi-Fi router. The router worked fine and my children were happier with their devices even though it was during a power outage.

It has a nice easy to feel ridge marking on one conductor for polarity identification but be careful to be consistent about using that tactile key, because the other conductor has white printed data, and it would be easy to confuse the issue. 16 gauge might be a bit small for some uses with landscaping lights, especially if you have lots of halogens, or long runs.

The polarity marking ridges are also more prominent than other brands (if polarity is important for your installation). It is not on a reel which could make installation a little frustrating (a loose coil of wire can be a pain to unroll and roll back up without a reel). If you need wire for your landscape lighting project, and 100 feet is sufficient, give this consideration.",

      "B0CSD3GJ53 ★★★★☆ <b>ETL listed, just like regular zip wire but 12 gauge</b> With spring headed our way, we're beginning to plan for some landscaping improvements in our yard, and low-voltage lighting is one of the things I'd like to add, so I picked up this wire. This wire looks like your typical lamp cord/zip wire, but at 12 gauge, this is pretty stout wire. Like zip wire, the two conductors are insulated in black flexible rubber insulation and joined by a thin section of rubber in the middle, so you can easily split the two conductors apart for making any necessary connections. And like typical zip wire, one of the conductors is identified by ribbing on the exterior of the insulation; this conductor is used, by convention, as the neutral wire. I've learned the hard way that before you put any wire into service, check it for breaks. Both conductors in this 100 foot spool passed the continuity test. What else is there to like? They include a chart (see photo) that shows the maximum wattage for any given length and gauge of wire, so it's nice to have that as a handy reference. It's also ETL listed (sort of like UL listed). For low voltage applications like landscape lighting, you could argue that being ETL listed is overkill, but it's a nice thing to have regardless since it is rated for up to 300 volts. One minor nit--I wish that they had length markings on the wire like some wires do--once you start using this, it's nice to be able to know how much length is remaining without having to unspool it and find it's not enough. Again, maybe overkill for a 100' spool but that would have been a really nice touch."

      "B07GH7JHG9 ★☆☆☆☆ <b>This cable is comprised of copper clad aluminum wire</b> First the pros: The cable comes in a nice box and the cable feeds out of this box without tangles. The outer black sheath is smooth and feeds well through conduit without lubrication. The product is priced very well if you think you are buying top quality copper conductor cable. The cons: This is really lousy cable. The conductors are supposed to be 23 AWG but the box I received measured below 24 AWG. The individual wires are brittle and break easily. So easily in fact that it was almost impossible to terminate in an RJ-45 plug. After spending hours placing this cable through walls and attic space, testing revealed there was a break somewhere along the cable. Makes perfect sense. Just manipulating the twisted pair to straighten for termination would cause at least one of the eight conductors to snap off. I have terminated lots of twisted pair cable and this was by far the most difficult to work with. Also, the product title does not indicate this is copper coated aluminum (CCA) cable wire."

      "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ <b>Appears to be true 16ga wire (unlike some others)</b> I've bought other similar spools of multi-conductor cable, and I've learned that you have to be careful about what you're getting. In one case, I ordered a 50' spool of 18 gauge wire that turned out to be a good 20% smaller, giving 20% higher resistance. So -- the first thing I wanted to check on this wire was the resistance of a single conductor through the length of the whole spool. Granted, I haven't unwound it to measure its length, so I'm taking that part at face value. The principle here is that any copper wire of a certain cross-sectional area (i.e. gauge) will have a given resistance per foot. There are many free online wire resistance calculators that will tell you just what the total resistance should be, when you provide it with the length and wire gauge. In this case, 50' of 16ga wire should be 0.201 ohms. As you can see in the photo, that's exactly what I have, within the precision of the meter I was using. It was actually flipping occasionally between 0.19 - 0.21 but typically sat on 0.20 ohms, which is pretty firm confirmation that this is, in fact, 16ga wire. Having confirmed that fact, I'm happy to recommend this cable for all intended purposes. The individual wires are easy to strip, have thick insulation, and the black outer sheath is sturdy and slick. Within each 16ga wire, the individual strands are pre-tinned, which gives much better corrosion resistance for when you're working in a wet, or otherwise corrosive, environment (like on a boat's wiring or other marine environment). Nice product, exactly as claimed."

      "B09V56LTY5 ★★★★★ <b>Holds up well in the sheathing</b> This wire has been sitting outside all summer for me to run from a solar charged pump controller to the sensors for water tank levels. It hasn't had any issue even when the deer seem to be doing their best to trample and knock over all the other parts of my system. Inside the black sheath even the comparatively small 16 gauge wire holds up very well. It was all easy to strip and get connected. Beyond that it's just wire; it holds together and delivers the signal. 10M is also a nice feature where you can get a decent length without having to buy in bulk.",
      "B07MCF1BMP ★★★★★ <b>Good copper wire.</b> Good wire for the money and have some left over for next install. Leds (WS2811) said I need power injection so last led on run will be similar brightness.... This wire works great. Black sheath is solid we will see how it holds up under RV exposed to elements. Gage is a little larger than factory leds so mentally I think that is a good thing. Bright leds here we go!"

      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★☆ <b>Very flexible, horrible smell</b> The cable is extremely flexible, it looks like aluminum though which is ok, since it's a lot of smaller strands, it should be big enough for 500w at 24v for me. It is 12awg which is nice since I'm running about 15 feet of wire. This only had 10ft for the review but you could always add more. Now when I opened the package, the silicone stench was horrible. Like made me pull my face away. But I realize it has to vacate it's VoCs and it's been sitting in a bag probably since it left the factory in China. Hopefully it will go away after a bit. Overall I'm impressed with it's flexibility. And it carries electricity like I need it to. One star off for the smell, and the stated 20ft, which is actually 10ft of each color wire, which you can only make a 10ft circuit with.",

Actually a terrible chemical odor, same odor on both sellers wires that I don't want to touch or be using around my hobby room- the only reason to 1star it. Other RC wires I recently purchased from other vendors had no strong odor, and work fine. They do look nice though, and are very flexible and well packaged- for wires.",
      "B06Y58W228 ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Putrid</b> Received earlier today and unwrapped a couple of the rolls to see how pliable they are. Seemed more than sufficient and proceeded outside to get a few things done. When I returned indoors, the most noxious smell had filled two rooms already. It was like some vile combination of Simple Green, baby vomit and cat spray. Absolutely atrocious smelling and took the rolls outside in hopes they rid me of the skunk family living nearby. Holy crap but the smell of this is truly something unexpected and will slap you square in the face if unprepared for it. Wow…just wow!!!",
      "B09DB9FD5M ★★★★☆ <b>Good for vehicle use, speaker or sensor runs.</b> As others stated it has a distinct odor that reminds you of walking into a Harbor Freight store. And for that reason using it under carpet, in engine compartments, etc, in a vehicle is a perfect use for such a wire. I plan on using it in my truck to wire up some speakers to an aftermarket head unit with built in amp. Hard to judge costs when everything is more expensive at the moment, but it is more than I would wish to pay. Do not see any approval markings on sheathing so not a wire I would use in my house for any dedicated circuit. Speaker wire on the floor there is a possibility, but not in any wall, or under any carpet, without certifications to avoid any insurance concerns.",

      "B0CG1GSW3P ★★★★★ <b>Very flexible for its ratings</b> This wire is very flexible for 10 AWG at 1000V rating. Comes in a plastic zipper bag, and it smelled very strongly of PVC after opening. I let it air out for a few days and the smell is mostly gone now, but if you are getting this to wire something internal to a vehicle or enclosed space, I would strongly recommend letting it air out for a few days before installation. Overall, nice high quality wire.",
      "B0BXT6SBZ4 ★★★★☆ <b>Nice wires</b> These silicone wires are exactly what they should be: flexible and durable with excellent heat resistance enabling soldering or applying heat shrink tubing without worrying about destroying the insulation. I do have 1 gripe about these cables though. They stink bad. I have never noticed my wires smelling strongly of chemical before and not sure if its normal or not. Regardless, I'd much rather do without the stench.",
      "B0BXT6SBZ4 ★★★★★ <b>Super soft and flexible.</b> This is some of the most flexible wire I have seen, and the silicone insulation is immune to soldering heat with no creeping or pull-back from the solder joint. The copper wire is pre-tinned and very easy to solder. I'll have to save this wire for the special high-flex applications and use the cheaper PVC elsewhere. The box serves as a dispenser that actually works because the wire is too soft to try to withdraw back into the exit holes as is often the case with PVC-insulated wire. There is some chemical odor coming from the insulation, or at least coming out of the box. I find it odd that silicone insulation would have an odor, so maybe it is coming from the spools or the cardboard. It's not a problem for me. I recommend keeping some of this wire on hand for some or all of your project needs.",
      "B07MZCXH5K ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Horrible toxic smell!</b> As soon as I pulled this wire bundle out of the box, I was overwhelmed by the toxic smell coming from this wire! I immediately took it outside and just put it in the back of my truck to get it out of the house. Problem is, this will be used inside as replacement wire for dry rotted wire in customer applications. I’m likely going to have to toss this mess due to the smell.",
      "B0CG1GSW3P ★★★★☆ <b>Decent hook-up wire, just let it air out</b> This is handy wire to have on-hand for projects around your car or boat. The cable is very flexible making it easy to route as desired. The wire strands are very fine (hair-like) which will require care when striping off the insulation and and making connections. When first opening the package I was overpowered by the strong plastic-y odor, so it spent several days airing out in the garage.",

Not sure why, but it worked great to add a 30A generator receptacle to my house. It's flat (vs round) but does come with somewhat of a chemical smell. It was easy to run and does the job.",

      "B09DB9FD5M ★★☆☆☆ <b>The insulation stinks a lot.</b> I did not understand the markings and took this wire because the description says suitable for LED strips. Perhaps it will do, but no one will connect LED strips with such a thick wire. Perhaps it is suitable for more powerful LED lamps for high voltage, but not for LED strips. But this is half the trouble. I would use this wire for other needs. But it is impossible to work with him. The wire stinks a lot. The insulation emits such a chemical and poisonous smell that I literally immediately began to have a headache. In my opinion, the use of this wire is possible only where you can hide it in special boxes, otherwise the stench will haunt you. The wire is moderately rigid / flexible, the insulation can be removed without problems.",

Recommended for anyone that DIY items around their house and/or projects that involve electrical.",
      "B09DB9FD5M ★☆☆☆☆ <b>It's 18 gauge electrical cable, but it's unmarked and smells very bad.</b> There is no spec markings on the casing so it can't be used in any application where a home inspection would require it. Mine came as a twisted mess that looks unprofessional and not really useable for anything more than auto speaker wire. Looks like just a haphazard cut from a much larger spool. Biggest complaint is it stinks up whatever room it is in. It is potent and I think the manufacturer knew this because it came double bagged. I thought the busted sauce that was in the Amazon box this came together in was what smelled up the box but several days later it's definitely the wire as I can smell it from 8 feet away. The price isn't bad and the copper wire itself seems ok. But the jacket used isn't useable for any code regulated work and it's only marking is the meter length interval. The jacket is also pretty thin and the inside wiring easy twists and came twisted. I wouldn't recommend it for anything beyond audio or LED work where the load is rather light.",
      "B0CN2RB68V ★★★★★ <b>very soft, flexible wire</b> The strands are so fine it bends very easily and has no memory. The individual strands feel almost like hair, they're very soft. It does have a strong chemical plastic smell, but I assume that will dissipate over time.",
      "B09DB9FD5M ★★★★☆ <b>Unmarked, not great quality, but gets the job done</b> This is just some basic cheap 18 gauge 2 wire cable. It does smell like it needs to out gas for a while. Other than that, it works. It is a little disturbing that the cable isn't marked, especially because the cable in the product photo is marked. Those markings on cables become pretty important when your trying to figure out what you dealing with a few years after installation or storage.",

      "B00EUGEZKQ ★★★★★ <b>As flexible as the charging cable on my EVSE</b> I was happy to see this cable was very flexible and easy to move around. The insulation is excellent throughout - heavy outside insulation, and thick pliable insulation on each conductor. Copper was clean and shiny - approximately 60 strands (I didn't count them all). That said, it does have a distinct petroleum odor - so best to keep it somewhere other than you bedroom.",
      "B09CCK5BD7 ★★★★☆ <b>Good quality wire.</b> I needed this wire to create my backup power and charge project with a solar panel. I am absolutely satisfied with the quality.

Hopefully this will not affect the quality of the insulation.",

Insulation is really soft, and doesn't easily kink and hold memory like cheaper wire. Additional premium touches - you would think how many \"features\" could a cable have, yet here we are: 1. Rubber cable end caps, which I assume are meant to protect the cut copper ends from oxidizing over long periods of storage. 2. A velcro tie. 3. Low odor. At least compared to some cheaper wire, which can instantly stink up my entire room. Last but not least, this cable is made in Korea by a company that is itself compliant to very strict standards. So personally I automatically expect higher quality compared to a certain other country where most cables are made, and by every indication this meets those expectations. Highly recommended if you can afford the premium, and/or need it for critical applications that need to be standard compliant.",

My methodology for Vine Program products is to give a more thorough -- often product-destructive -- review. If I like the product, I buy my own version of it, otherwise, it gets donated post-testing. I also may include my opinion on the product's value proposition to the market. REVIEW: -------------------------------- If I was to give a description that people might be able to reference, I'd say this feels like the power cord you'd find on a high-end power tool. It's thick, and doesn't have a strong odor (common in cheaper products). Each comes with some zipties and a few pieces of heat-shrink if you need it. Inspection of the individual wires does seem to indicate tinned copper (instead of tinned aluminum), but I'd need a better device to really tell. At slightly over ~$1/ft, it's not a bad deal if you just need it in a pinch for a project.

But also because most people opt for 1/0 gauge instead of 1 AWG so there are far more 1/0 stuff out there than regular 1AWG. My only reason for getting the 50 pack for 1AWG was because I got about 30ft of it for free (leftovers from another guy's project), and because the 50 pack meets the better value for amount of $/terminal without paying the price of the 100 pack. Could have went with a 10 or 25 pack, but those have far worse $/terminal. If I mess up some, I still will have about 30+ left, but it's unlikely. There are no other companies that make this specific size with this amount of quality and at an optimal $/terminal, even the chinese made ones. In fact, the worse quality chinese ones are more expensive than these that are made in the US, and I haven't seen any in 1AWG that are under $0.70/terminal and with no complaints of \"copper is too thin, so breaks easily.\" You can easily spend over 2 hours looking for some decent quality, cheap lug terminals, but this company is the only one that does it (assuming that you buy in 50/100 pack). Sometimes you come across funny reviews that buy 4/0 lugs for 4AWG cables. Heck even if you don't buy a 50/100 pack the quality of these dominate the majority of lug terminals out there. Didn't know you could just order directly from their site, but there's a small discount if you do cause of the amazon seller fee.",

I usually buy my lugs directly from sky high car audio, but I was in a bit of a money pinch so $10 for a pack of 10 didn’t seem that worth it at the time. I ended up coming across these bad boys, which happened to be the best deal around. 50 lugs for less than $40. Honestly I was pretty hyped. I ended up remember that car audio 1/0 is not standard 1/0 welding wire. It’s actually oversized 1/0…so right in between 1/0-2/0. I decided to go for the 2/0 lugs and purchased 50 of them. I tested it out on 1/0 sky high wire and it fit like a GLOVE. The 2/0 lug itself is smaller than sky high 1/0 lug, which was kinda nice because I am working on tight space. I did try the 2/0 lug on some sky high 2/0 and there’s no chance it would go in. Maybe if you force a ton, but even then it won’t work. I couldn’t even get the head of the wire in and these lugs are flared outwards too. I haven’t crimped them yet but I will soon, I’ll update the review when I get to crimping stage. But as of now, they get a 5/5 for fitting oversized 1/0 car audio wire. Update 3/6/22: crimping is absolutely awesome. I have two types of crimpers, hydraulics and handheld $30 crimpers from amazon. I decided to use the handheld crimper, even though it doesn't go up to 2/0 size. Stuck it on the 1/0 setting and did 2 crimps at the bottom and top of the lug. Had my dad pull one end of the wire while I held the lug end of the wire. We both pulled as hard as we could and it didn't even move. I'd say they work as intended."

There's a lot of extra stuff I could probably have just done without in favor of more wire, but oh well. The main concern was if this was really copper vs CCA or some other gimmick.

The wire strips nicely and is super flexible because it has many very small strands of tinned copper with a soft silicone jacket. This will be great to use in confined spaces where there are lots of bends. I plan to use this mainly for various circuits in my van, especially where having different colored wires is helpful.",
      "B07CHSG169 ★★★★★ <b>This is standard wire, just what I wanted</b> The spool seems like the amount is accurate, no off flavors, heats as it should. This is a safe call, compared to fancy dual staples or something where it is just different gauges of Kanthal, which is a registered trademark, fun fact. If you've been using drippers for years like me, this is a very safe bet, especially for Amazon. It is bog standard, just how I wanted it.",
      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★★ <b>Great stuff! 6 coils, more than enough for multiple small projects, nice insulator. Works great!</b> I do a lot of small projects, usually LED and battery stuff, but sometimes repairs and prototyping too. This is GREAT stuff to have laying around for low-voltage work. This should carry anywhere from 14 to 22+ amps of current, depending on the temperature you are comfortable running at. While the silicone insulator may be good up to 200ºC, I'd probably stay below 90ºC (194ºF). At 600 volts, this could deliver 8.4kW up to 13.2kW of power, depending on your sensitivity for temperature! But at 12 volts, more like 168 watts. Or 48 volts, 672 watts. Fun stuff, electricity! This has been great to have around while building out USB-C PD devices to run everything in my house but small appliances off of USB-C PD 3.0 and 3.1.

The package includes five spools of very nice quality wire with five different color insulation used. Each spool has 20 feet of wire. I really like the insulation on this wire. It's a soft silicone vs vinyl which I most often used in the past. This gives the wire great flexibility, as well as heat and abrasion resistance. The most commonly used red and black (for positive and negative DC wiring) are represented, as well as white, blue, and yellow. The wire consists of (according to the ad) 252 individual tiny strands of tinned copper wire. I didn't order this pack for any particular purpose in mind, but rather to have on hand when needed.

What showed up was six spools of 10' each 12ga silicone insulated wire in varying colors. Nothing to be mad at there... During my work I used a couple different wire strippers to remove insulation and had no issues, telling me the wire is truly 12ga. The individual strands are quite fine, which can make crimping a minor pain but it does make for super flexible wire, which is what I needed. The silicone insulation is probably not suitable for use in, say, an engine bay, but is very convenient for applications in a more protected environment. Got what I needed to done with no hassles, and I'm left wondering what's not to like?",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Nice flexible wire with good insulation. Glad to have it in my inventory.</b> This is really nice 20 gauge wire with excellent insulation and flexibility. Each of the 6 spools holds 50' of tinned copper wire for a total of 300'. Each strand of the 20 gauge twisted wire has been tinned before the wire was twisted and insulated in colored silicone but the ends should be tinned again before soldering to a terminal to provide the best solder connection. The insulation is easy to strip with a standard pair of wire strippers and the wire tins and solders well. I'm giving it 5 stars because it is quality wire at a good price and it is a welcome addition to my electronics repair supplies.",
      "B0B8C5XZMN ★★★★★ <b>Great coils for the buck</b> By far best coils on Amazon only down fall is the 2 weeks it takes to get them but well worth the wait knowing some company’s are charging 10-20 dollars for just 2 coils and you get 100 in this pack"

      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>A Comprehensive Starter Set for Electronics Enthusiasts</b> The 18 Gauge Wire Kit offers an excellent starting point for anyone delving into the realm of electronics, whether as a hobbyist or a budding professional. This kit is particularly appealing for its thoughtful compilation of essential wiring needs, presented in a user-friendly package. Variety and Quality: One of the standout features of this kit is the variety it offers—eight colors of 18 gauge silicone wire, each extending to 23 feet (7 meters). While the length of each spool might not cater to extensive projects, the assortment allows for ample experimentation and small-scale builds. The choice of silicone for the wire sheathing is a commendable one, providing a durable, heat-resistant covering that forgives the occasional soldering mishap, making it an ideal selection for beginners. Additionally, silicone's chemical resistance and flexibility are qualities that veteran electronics enthusiasts will appreciate. Accessories and Utility: The inclusion of color-coordinated heat shrink tubing and zip ties adds a layer of organization and professionalism to projects, enhancing the overall utility of the kit. While the wire stripper may not impress seasoned users, it's a valuable addition for those just starting, offering an all-in-one solution to basic wiring needs. Packaging and Design: The kit's packaging is notably well-conceived, featuring a box with holes for each wire spool, facilitating easy access and storage. This system helps maintain a clean and organized workspace, a boon for any project. However, the opportunity for improvement lies in the visibility of the remaining wire on each spool; a clear plastic window on the box would have perfectly rounded out the design by allowing users to gauge their wire stock at a glance. Conclusion: In summary, the 18 Gauge Wire Kit earns a solid five-star rating not through groundbreaking innovation but through the thoughtful assembly of high-quality components tailored to meet the needs of both novice and experienced electronics enthusiasts. It stands out as a comprehensive and practical kit, perfect for anyone looking to embark on or expand their electronics projects with a reliable selection of wires and tools at their disposal.",

This kit comes with 8 rolls of wire (brown, white, black, red, orange, blue, yellow, and green), a bag of zip ties, a bag of heat-shrink tubing, and a wire stripper. The bags of zip ties and heat-shrink tubing include zip ties and heat-shrink tubing that match the colors of the wires with the exception of black zip ties. The kit I received did not include any black zip ties but those are easy to find elsewhere. The wire features silicone insulation and is very flexible. The insulation is soft enough that it can be easily stripped by simply pinching and pulling on the insulation. This makes the wire easy to work with but causes some concern for how easy the wire could be damaged. The box features holes that make it easy to pull the wires out of the box while keeping the spools contained in the box. The included wire stripper is very simple but a good addition to the kit. Most hobbyists will prefer to use their own wire strippers, but some beginners may find the included wire stripper useful. Overall, this wire kit seems like a great kit for hobbyists who prefer a clean and organized project and workspace.",

      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Assortment of colors makes it easy to keep circuits identifiable</b> This is a set of 6 different colors of tinned copper wire that came on individual spools. This is a great set to have on hand for use with projects that I will need to wire in the future. The colors of the silicone covering is easily visible and identify. I'm have not used wire with thus type of shielding before so I was skeptical. I opened one spool and put it to the test. I knew that tinned wire was easier to solder and offered less resistance and works great for wiring projects. What I didn't know was the silicone covering. After opening the spool I found the covering to be very flexible. It was more maneuverable the other wire I had worked with. It kind of felt like plastic and rubber blended together. It claimed it would withstand high heat and extreme cold. I used my lighter and it took a long time to melt the silicone. I then put the wire in the freezer and after freezing it was still very pliable. This set also came with different colored zip ties so if you need to keep different wires together in a group going to one place these come in handy. This is a great set to keep on hand and I'm sure you will be happy with every project you use them on. They offer so much more then other wire's I've used in the past",
      "B0B15DXZHJ ★★★★★ <b>Die Ware ist wie beschrieben</b> in einer praktischen Kartonage-Spenderbox. Die farbigen Kabelbinder und Schrumpfschlauchstücke recht nett, auf das Werkzeugchen kann man verzichten.",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>18 Gauge Is A Useful Size; Color-Coded Helps Too</b> I do a lot of electrical projects. I always use the appropriate gauge and type of wire and 18 gauge is a frequent pick. It is useful for medium-draw circuits like LV power supplies and LED lighting. The color-coding is particularly useful for the same reasons. I like my Red Green Blue & White wires to my LEDs to actually be RGBW in color. This kit has enough wire for several small projects and also comes with colored shrink tubing and colored wire ties. I have professional wire strippers but the one in the kit will go in one of my field bags just in case.",
      "B0CN2RB68V ★★★★★ <b>NICE SELECTION OF WIRE</b> 6 colors of 16 gauge wire along with matching color tie straps and shrink tubing for splices, this is a very useful set of wire for the homeowner as well as the professional. 25 feet is not much, but for small jobs this wire is a good selection. It is very pliable and can be used in almost any situation from mechanical connections to solder connections. The variety of colors lens itself to use for HVAC, electronics and other more complicated electronic devices. This is high quality wire and I would recommend it highly.",
      "B0BWY3JGGV ★★★★★ <b>This wire assortment is ideal for both electronic hobbyists and technicians.</b> Each wire contains 40 copper strands, surrounded by silicone insulation rated at 600 Volts. The 40 individual strands make the wire very flexible, which makes routing them through tight spaces easy. The conductors come pre-tinned, making soldering quick and reducing the chance of having cold solder joints. The six spools of wire come in a compact cardboard box that doubles as a dispenser, preventing the wire from un-spooling in your toolbox or bag. There is also space inside the box to store a small number of colored wire ties and the wire stripper that comes with the wire. This wire is a quality wire at a very affordable price.",
      "B0BWY3JGGV ★★★★★ <b>Good Wire With Extra Stuff Included</b> Here’s a case where I apparently did not read the product description thoroughly. The wire comes with small zip ties, a “toy” wire stripper, and heat shrink. I didn’t need any of those items. However, the wire itself is of good quality. The insulation is, shall we say, sturdy. A good, professional wire stripper is needed to bare the wires. The conductors are all individually tinned, and the wire is fairly flexible. The six different colors will help me to keep things straight when wiring between the six circuit boards on my project. Very happy with the wire. The wire stripper might work well as a letter opener.",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★☆ <b>individually tinned strands !</b> It appears that each and every strand of this wire is actually tinned, not just simply ran through a tinning process as a bundle of wire. What I mean to say is these strands look to have been tinned before they were twisted together at the factory. Much better process than what the description portrays. Each wire comes on it's own individual plastic reel, but they are not labeled. The actual wire sheathing IS labeled with the wires size and capacity. Speaking of the wire sheathing, it is very SOFT, leading to a wire that's very flexible but at the cost of abrasion resistance. You can easily strip the sheathing from the wire with your finger nails. The box of 6 colors I ordered came with a small number of small colored zip ties that correspond to each color of wire in the box, a very nice touch.",
      "B0B3H27JG2 ★★★★★ <b>Convenient dispenser</b> I got this (along with a box of the 22 awg) to wire a custom-built Delta printer. The box is nicely designed, so you can feed the end of each colour through a hole in the box and pull out the length you need, without having to open the box. It comes with a collection of coloured cable-ties and heat shrink, plus a rather feeble wire stripper, which I thought was a nice touch. The wire is a good quality, crimps and solders easily and is easy to work with. This box was primarily for wiring the mains, power supply to the main board and power the mosfets, hot end and print bed.",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Good wire for your projects.</b> I found the wire to be comparable to other high quality silicone wire I have used in the past. The wire is very flexible, and the silicone insulation is consistent and without blemishes. The included, colored nylon wire ties come in handy and may allow for color coding bundles, or securing wires. I'm trying to think of a negative thing about this wire, but I can not. When I need more wire, I'd be happy to purchase this in the future.",
      "B0B3H27JG2 ★★★★★ <b>Good Wire Kit</b> I own a few of these wire kits now i have 18awg silicone 7 spools and the same kit with 22 awg silicone and a 6 spool 22 awg stranses pvc and i just needed a thinner set for making usb cables and for a whole host of other projects so i got this 26awg stranded.The kit has a neat box with outlets for the different spools which are clearly marked and as a bonus it came with 60 cable ties that are colour matched to the wire spools so 10 of each colour and the same with heat shrink with 10 of each colour and a small wire stripper which i now have 2 of and they do work well once you get the hang of it.So to sum up a good wire set for my needs.",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★☆ <b>Very fine stranded conductors, does seem to be tinned copper, 600V?</b> Nice assortment of wire and colors, and comes in a nice dispenser box and comes with zip ties. The wire conductors seem very fine and seemed to be tinned copper as claimed. I tested this up to near 10 amps DC 12V and had no sign of heating up. This says rated up to 600V but I don't see any UL or other mark or anything on the product claiming this hence one star off. I think would be ok for like 120, 240 but not really seeing stamp marking rating for this. I got as sometimes need larger cored stranded wires for projects.",
      "B0CN2RB68V ★★★★★ <b>Great for small wiring stations</b> Everything is organized very well in this set. Each color wired spool is individually wrapped and the box has a dispenser hole for each spool to feed each wire for easy length dispensing. The set also includes some zipties to help with any wire management needs and some heatshrink tubing for after your strip the wire jackets or solder. The core is tinned copper which looks to be good quality so conduction and signal stability shouldn't be a problem. I'd like to see more size options, but this set is a really good deal for what you get."

      "B0CGQ29J9Q ★★★★★ <b>Wow</b> This is really good premium wire. UL rating gives a peace of mind especially for critical applications. Insulation is really soft, and doesn't easily kink and hold memory like cheaper wire. Additional premium touches - you would think how many \"features\" could a cable have, yet here we are: 1. Rubber cable end caps, which I assume are meant to protect the cut copper ends from oxidizing over long periods of storage. 2. A velcro tie. 3. Low odor. At least compared to some cheaper wire, which can instantly stink up my entire room. Last but not least, this cable is made in Korea by a company that is itself compliant to very strict standards. So personally I automatically expect higher quality compared to a certain other country where most cables are made, and by every indication this meets those expectations. Highly recommended if you can afford the premium, and/or need it for critical applications that need to be standard compliant.",
      "B07TFF9FTM ★★★★★ <b>Surprisingly good</b> Packaging is excellent, each spool comes with its own reusable open-use-close Velcro cover, wire gauge measures as-advertised, and the insulation is perfect for tricky soldering projects like multi-pin connectors where the soldering iron would normally melt the insulation of a standard wire. Saving to my reorder list. Would recommend.",
      "B0829NPHF3 ★★★★★ <b>It is what it is - wire - 20AWG - and nicely bundled</b> I was looking for 20AWG 3-conductor for some CW/WWLED strips I am installing. I didn't want to use 24AWG since I needed to run some lengths a good distance - and 18AWG seemed overkill. This roll was one of the few I found - and is doing the trick! Plus it is nicely bundled with Velcro to make management of the exist roll easier.",
      "B07FMWNF3J ★★★★★ <b>It's all in the details</b> This is a really great assortment of wiring. Each roll evan has a little velcro strap that goes around the roll to keep unused wire from unwinding. A great detail. The insulation is easy to strip, and when using shrink tubing, the insulation doesn't burn easily. I recommend it!",
      "B0CGQ29J9Q ★★★★★ <b>Good Quality</b> Nicely covered with end caps to protect from the elements until ready to use. Has an included Velcro strap to neatly hold wire not used. I find little touches like that to be a good sign of just how much effort and care is taken by companies about their product while simple many don't go that extra mile or make the effort. So, wire is 18AWG as expected and conducts current exactly the same on both wires and ends. Nicely wrapped in a black jacket and is flexible enough to be ran through needed twists and turns. Good cable",
      "B0829NPHF3 ★★★★★ <b>As described, but double check your needs!</b> This is exactly the product that is described. It comes neatly spooled and held in place with three velcro wire wraps (a nice bonus, since I use those with all sorts of stuff). The wires can be pulled apart very easily, without any fear of exposing copper, for applications where you don’t need three or where the wires terminate in different places. My only caution is to double check the gauge requirement for your application. These are very thin wires. They’re supposed to be that thin, but if you’re not well acquainted with electrical hardware, you might accidentally order these for the wrong application. Know up front how much current you’ll be running (and how far) so that you don’t burn something down. In my application, I was mostly wiring LEDs, which draw a tiny current.",
      "B07FMWNF3J ★★★★☆ <b>VERY FLEXIBLE, like a wet noodle. Thin, does not inspire confidence but we'll see.</b> the box is different. Not as pictured but I did not buy it for the box. They did come with handy velcro cable wraps to keep them from unspooling.",
      "B07FMWNF3J ★★★★★ <b>Quality packaging and wire.</b> I like that the wire sheathing is of good quality and that the rolls come with a loop to keep the wire from unrolling.",
      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★☆ <b>Nice looking cable</b> Right out of the box/bag I was impressed with this wire. They certainly paid attention to the presentation. It has a shiny outer jacket, it comes with two velcro straps to keep it neatly coiled, it also has a baggie full of heat-shrink tubing and tie wraps. They even took the time to strip off about 2 inches of the outer jacket on either end of the cable and then stripped the ends of each individual wire. So good job to them for recognizing that presentation matters. The outer jacket is just a sleeve, it's not bonded to the wire like many others. I doubt that this is burial grade and the listing doesn't say that it is. The listing shows 12 volts, but if you strip back enough of the outer jacket, you can see that the wire itself has 600V and 105 degrees Celsius printed on it. For me, this wire is going to work great and I'm happy with it.",
      "B0CGQ29J9Q ★★★★★ <b>Decent price for very nice quality 4 conductor</b> It's not cheap, but if you only need a small length of wiring, this is about what you'll find, pricewise. Copper is expensive, but it is what it is. As for quality, it seems great. I only needed around 20' of 18AWG for a project with LED strips I needed to make independently dimmable. I ended up receiving almost 23', so I'm a very happy camper! The insulator is great. It's flexible and the cable is over 6mm. I appreciate the end caps and the velcro strap, nice touch.",
      "B0CGQ29J9Q ★★★★★ <b>Top notch wire</b> This is some pretty impressive stuff. I've seen a lot of nice wire that uses PVC jacketing but this seems to be more of a rubber coating than a plasticky PVC, which is nicer and more flexible. The wires within the jacket seem good quality, right down to the tinning and the fineness of the individual strands. Its pretty fancy that they include a hook-and-loop band to keep it organized and put caps on the ends.",
      "B0CGQ29J9Q ★★★★★ <b>Very high quality cable</b> This cable is really high quality and very flexible. They even put on cable ends to insulate it from the air to keep the cable ends as clean as possible during transportation and storage. Once you remove the outer insulation, there is a paper lining and then three color coded wires that is easy to to strip so you can attach it to your device or project. It also comes with a reusable cable strap incase you need to store the left over cable for another use. Overall this really is a very high quality cable and is sure to last a long time in service.",
      "B07TFF9FTM ★★★★★ <b>Great product</b> Prompt shipping, very nice, plyable, sheathing and each spool has a velcro-like strap to wrap arround the wire so it does not become unwound and make a mess. A very clever idea since the product is very flexable unlike solid wire. Recommended!",
      "B08R35TKZ1 ★★★★★ <b>Seems larger diameter compared to all my other 10 guage</b> Looks great. Heavier and larger diameter to other similar guage wire I have. I like the Velcro loop that it comes with and good price.",
      "B0793MRX91 ★★★★★ <b>Works for me</b> I liked this wire because it strips nicely for attaching ferrules etc. Handy box to store the various colors where you see the color you need at a glance. Also VERY NICE velcro stay strips on each roll to keep wire from unspooling... Very flexible - strands don't seem to break like some wire....",
      "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ <b>Durable, very nice wiring harness.</b> I am updating an emergency vehicle and am using this to run the equipment. It’s easy to work with and good thick wire. Came with nice little Velcro straps for keeping the roll together. The finish is nice on the outer casing. Nice gloss black. Excellent product. In fact I bought another 50 foot roll. And the prices for this is extremely good. Glad I found this wiring.",
      "B07TFF9FTM ★★★★★ <b>Surprisingly great</b> I am astounded at the high quality of the wire that I have in my hand given the low price that I paid for it. The gauge appears accurate; the insulation seems to be high quality and is not overly stiff; the wire is easy to strip. Other little things I like: The wire spools have holes on the sides, rather than through the spindle, making it much easier to use them to prevent a full-ish spool from unraveling. The spools arrived wrapped in reusable hook-and-loop cable ties rather than the more typical, annoying to open plastic shrink wrap. The cardboard dispenser box is actually sturdy, and the holes are well-placed and the right size for the wire. It will absolutely be a good long-term storage solution for the wire. It would be hard to be less than impressed with this product. When it comes to basic breadboard-compatible hookup wire, this one appears to be the one to buy."

      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ <b>Nice Long Roll...</b> I picked this up for the 1001 projects I'm working on, what was a benefit for my project but might be a drawback for others is that the outer insulator is not bonded to the inner wires... I like this because when needed I can easily remove the outer sleeve and get 4 individual wires without much work, and it also seems to allow the cable more flex... The presentation when opening the package was really nice, with two velcro straps holding it in a nice coil, the outer sleeve cut back a few inches and the wires stripped on both ends... The bag with several small pieces of heat shrink and some nylon zip ties was a nice addition...",

      "B089D8813Z ★★★★★ <b>used in engine bay</b> Used as part of an aftermarket gauge cluster install and needed durable wire to use in the engine bay where the cluster splices into the electrical system. I like the box with the holes to feed wiring through, it kept my worksite organized. The bonus zip ties and heat shrink are good, too. I don't feel ripped off! Would buy again.",
      "B0CN2RB68V ★★★★★ <b>Very flexible wire, dispenser not as pictured</b> I use a lot of wire for various DIY projects and electronic repair. I really liked the dispenser shown in the product photos and video and, to be completely honest, I ordered this wire at least considering it supposedly came with the nifty dispenser box. The \"dispenser\" box has 3 holes on each side, ostensibly to allow you to pull the wire from the box. However, the box is so tight, you can barely get it to close, so, when closed, it does not allow the individual spools to move freely at all. At best, when you pull one strand, the spool next to it also moves to some extent. The wire itself appears to be fantastic - very supple and super flexible. The silicone insulation is on the thick side, so any sharp bends or small nicks probably won't have a big impact on the stranded wire within. The also include some matching zip-ties and (what I am assuming is) heat-shrink tubing. Since the review is for the wire itself, I won't take any stars for the disappointing \"dispenser\" box because the wire is actually really nice.",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Excellent stranded, tinned copper wire with silicone jacket.</b> Not much to say about this product other than it is exactly what is promised in the listing. I sanded down the tinned stranded wires and verified copper wire underneath. I also heated the silicone insulation to above 600°F and there was no scorching, distortion, or melting. The pack also comes with some bonus zip ties. This is a fine product.",
      "B0BWY3JGGV ★★★★☆ <b>About as expected</b> The wire and the box are fine. The sleeving and the zip ties are as cheap as expected, but you aren't buying the wire for the sleeving, right?",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Flexible silcone sheath!</b> I ordered these because I needed more flexibility than the standard plastic sheets offered. The silicone sheaths on these are great. Nicely flexible and easy to strip. The zip ties were a nice little bonus. The cardboard box they come in also serves as a dispenser. The issue I had though was that when you lined up the spools with the dispensing holes, they are a little wider than the inside of the box so the box does not close flush (i.e., bulging at the sides) and the spools won't spin freely. So, using the box as a dispenser was a no-go. Other than that, the wiring itself is nice quality, nice vibrant colors and again - nicely flexible.",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>Good variety kit, high quality wire</b> I ordered this wire to use with DIY electronics projects as well as wiring accessory devices in my electric bike. The main reason why I chose this wire over cheaper wire variety packs is because this wire has silicone insulation which is more durable, flexible, and heat resistant than conventional wire insulation. The silicone insulation did not disappoint. You can see in the video I attached that the insulation is quite resistant to heat and does not melt as easily. Notice the reaction of the bare wire to heat in the video as well. The wire is indeed tinned and when you heat it, the tinning material evaporates and the bare copper wire is left underneath. This is something you should take into consideration when connecting these wires to a terminal since the tinning should be removed in order to get a solid connection. Probably a regular lighter is more suited to this task than a blow torch. Overall I am very satisfied with this wire kit. The wire is all very high quality and perfect for automotive applications due to the heat and wear resistance of the silicone insulation. This kit also comes with a wire stripper, some zip ties, and heat shrink. I could care less about these extras but it might be a nice perk if you don't have these items already. I would highly recommend this kit if you need a variety of different colored wires for an automotive project. The silicone insulation is the best you can get.",
      "B0CN768S54 ★★★★★ <b>Good Molded Wire</b> 5 color coded wires in a nice thick cable. Neat that it comes with a few heat shrink sleeves and zip ties. I don't think there's any shielding, so probably great for most things but perhaps not ground burial. Exactly what I needed for some automotive (low voltage) signal/sensor wiring.",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Very small reels.</b> 10 feet of 12 ga wire does not take up a lot of space, so the reels they are on are very small. a small section of conduit works to make a great reel for taking wire off. Color is good and they include color coded tie wraps that match the color of the cable. Very flexible. Wire strippers are easy to use. Good for small wiring projects.",

The wire stripper might work well as a letter opener.",
      "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ <b>looks like high quality wire</b> This looks like some of the better wire that I have gotten recently. Most of the wire you get these days looks like it is a gauge or two smaller than what is claimed. This 16 ga wire looks like 16 ga wire! Many other companies would have called this 14 ga. I am very happy with it so far. The wire is tinned copper, with a nice thick jacket. They also include a few zip ties and pieces of heat shrink tubing. That is nice, but the cable is what you are purchasing, and seems to be every bit of what it is advertised to be. I like and recommend this cable.",
      "B0CV7XSN9H ★★★★★ <b>Decent quality!</b> I didn't realize it came with some cable ties, so that's a nice plus, as is the fact that it is UL listed.",
      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ <b>Proven to be great for vehicle applications. Very nice quality wire.</b> This is very nice wire. It is made of durable PVC, yet still quite flexible thanks to the fine-strand tinned wire. I've used it for running a new auxiliary fuse/relay box for a few additions on my truck. I wanted a shielded and grouped wire and this is the perfect solution. Seems very heat-resistant for soldered parts too. Comes with a generous amount of zip-ties and shrink tubing that is already cut to length. This company cares about producing a quality product and meeting the needs of customers. Highly recommend.",
      "B0CN2RB68V ★★★★★ <b>Very flexible high temperature wire</b> After being in the electronics industry since I was in high school decades ago, I’ve accumulated a vast quantity of wire. Most is either heavy gauge or 18 gauge and smaller. I ordered this 16AWG assortment to fill the gap in the 5 to 10 amp capacity range. I was impressed by how flexible this wire is and its resistance to high temperatures. With a 200C and 600V rating, it can be used in just about any application. Unlike most stranded wire, there are way too many strands to count, which is the reason why it is so flexible. Unless using a crimp connector, the large number of very flexible strands almost dictates the end should be tinned before making a connection. The insulation was unfazed by direct application of a soldering iron when checking its tinning ability. The individual spools came in a box with 6 holes along one side to make it easy to pull out the length needed. Included with the wire were shrink sleeving and small wire ties in assorted colors like the wire.",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Practical kit for small wiring jobs</b> This is a convenient set of wire for small automotive or hobby projects. The wire is tinned copper, and I exposed the copper with a grinder to be sure of the copper. The tinning makes the actual wire appear silver and protects against corrosion. Very flexible and finely stranded, so it is easy to pull and route where needed and various colors for identification according to your needs. 14 gauge is typical for 15 amps or less in relatively short distances like a vehicle, and the silicone insulation is both durable and well suited for applications where moisture, oils or dirt may be encountered. Also comes with an assortment of wire ties. Note that this is not manufactured or or suitable for use in house wiring, nor is it UL Listed. Overall, a nice selection of quality wire at a reasonable price.",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>Wire set for DIY, STEM projects, education</b> Eight colours of 18 guage wire with ties and shrink tubes to match, plus a basic mini wire stripper - this makes a good introduction kit for the kids STEM projects, and for me to have some spare for lighting architectural models. The storage box is useful for keeping wire clean and organised, while having holes to pull through lengths neatly. That's a bonus to me as I like an organised workspace and to teach that to the kids. The wires are easy to work with, flexible and clean. The two colours we've used have no defects. Will make a good gift too.",
      "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ <b>Quality wire in a durable jacket</b> I acquired this cable to wire some repair some existing lights and add supplemental warning lights on my tractor. Wire for rear tractor lighting needs to be run along the underside where brush, sticks, briars claw away at it constantly. More than once, I have had wiring damaged or destroyed. I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications. I really like this wire, and I look forward to using it to upgrade my tractor warning lights in preparation for spring. It would be equally suitable for use on a mowers or trailers as well. I think this product will provide adequate protection for wiring in a tough environment for a long time. In fact, with good end connections, I am hopeful that it will last as long as the equipment.",
      "B0CN768S54 ★★★★★ <b>Perfectly suited my needs!</b> I only needed to use the inner colored wires for a model car I'm working on, so I had to cut into the outer protective jacket to remove them. The jacket is very tough and thick, so it protects the 5 inner wires well. The individual wires were also very easy to solder. As a nice bonus, they include a few large zip ties as well as several pieces of heat shrink tube, which I will definitely use as well!",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Nice multipack of wire</b> I ordered this 12 gauge wire for use on some projects. The wire is thick and sturdy and easy to work with. I like the silicone on the outside. It also came with a bunch of little zipties.",
      "B0BGS5GRSK ★★★★★ <b>Really conducts</b> Arrived fast as described. Wire is good quality and length is good for car. Wire ties and shrink tubes were a pleasant surprise.",
      "B0CN2RB68V ★★★★☆ <b>For fixing up my old golf cart</b> We have an older cart that has some assorted wiring jobs. I was looking for some heavier wire in several different colors to make some improvements. I thought this kit fit the bill. I got my different colors and the shrink tube and wire ties are a nice addition. Works great!",
      "B0B15DXZHJ ★★★★★ <b>Fili resistenti e flessibili</b> Prodotto che include diversi accessori tra cui la scatola/dispenser, tagliacavi, guaine termorestringenti e fasce di plastica per cavi.

      "B0CN2RB68V ★★★★★ <b>Very flexible, resists abrasion and heat</b> You can't get good high current test leads so I make my own. This wire box contains six colors of 14-gauge silicone coated wire. These are made up of multiple strands of fine copper wire for the highest flexibility. The silicone covering resists abrasion and heat. I have a habit of leaving my soldering iron on the table and it will burn thru other wires it might hit. A hot iron has no effect on this wire. That makes it great for automotive applications too where abrasion and heat can damage other wire. This is just a great wire to work with because once bent, it will stay in place. Kit comes with some small ty wraps in the same matching colors along with heat shrink for added strain relief if needed. The box has pre punched holes for dispensing the wire and keep it from unraveling.",
      "B0CLBHT8YX ★★★★☆ <b>Good for small projects</b> It seems I'm always scrounging for sections of wire on different RV projects and usually find something leftover from an older finished project that works but maybe is not the best (such as by adding pigtails). This has 5 fifty foot rolls of 5 colors that should end the scrounging. This is a copper clad aluminum core (CCA) wire. The copper reduces corrosion caused by moisture and oxidation and adds surface conductivity. I got it to use for some small 12V wiring projects in the RV (additional 12 volt computer fan for gas refrigerator cooling) and to have on hand when I just need some short lengths of wire. For reference, Cu Clad Al (CCA) wire can be used for main wire projects but at a much larger gauge as aluminum has a higher resistance than copper. 12 AWG is recommended for a 15 Amp 110V circuit and 10 AWG for a 20 Amp. This is a 36 strand 16 AWG braided wire so it's not made for heavy loads or 110 volt wiring. Specs are for up to 80 volts. The wire is flexible and there's enough copper coating for it to solder easily to itself. If there's trouble having the wire stick, a copper infused solder works. I used some lead free Rosin Core 2.0 Sn99 Ag0.3 Cu0.7 electronics solder and everything was sucked into the wire and stuck together. I couldn't find the percent by weight of copper anywhere on the rolls, package, or website. The range for CCA is anywhere from 10% to 24% by weight, with the more the better (but also more expensive). 15 small zip ties and 10 heat shrink tubes are included in the box. I'm never going to use this on a main AC wiring project but for small electrical projects, it's a good economical choice and should last a long time. If you don't want 5 colors and a dispenser box, 4-color roll packages of 100'/roll 16AWG of this brand are the same price if you shop around. 4 stars - copper specs not given.",

      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>A Good Selection of Hook-Up wire for any DIYer.</b> As a long time electronics hobbyist, I’m always in need of hook-up wire in many colors, so I usually have to resort to pulling apart old multi-conductor cables to find the right wire for my many projects. This kit makes that so much easier! The wire is high quality tinned copper with a thick silicone insulation that can withstand high voltage and temperature. The wire itself takes solder beautifully, the insulation doesn’t melt when soldering, and it is flexible enough to be used in most situations. The kit also includes some color matched heat-shrink tubing, small zip-ties, and a mini wire stripper. You can keep the wire spools in the box and pull out small lengths as needed or add them to your spool holder like I did (see photo). This wire kit is an excellent choice for any DIY hobbyist who appreciates having a selection of high quality wire on hand for their projects. It’s a bit pricy, so the hobbyist themselves may not seek it out, but it certainly would make an excellent gift that they would definitely appreciate receiving.",

      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★☆☆☆ <b>Low Voltage Only</b> The good: Tinned copper is excellent. Arrives in a nice large zip lock bag. Shrink tubes and tiewraps are cool. The bad: I was wondering how the supplier coiled the cable so nicely with both ends next to each other! What Is received was just a plain coil with the other end in the center. That's a bit deceiving huh. The outer cable shield is a thin wall, not a full cover and fill. -1 ⭐ The ugly: There are no markings on this cable at all. No size, no certifications, no material identification, no vendor, no voltage rating, no temperature rating. None. That really makes that cable only usable for applications below 50V and where you are ok with taking a risk. -2 ⭐⭐ Bummer.",

      "B0BGS5GRSK ★★★★★ <b>Good product.</b> Decent wire for the money. It came with a bunch a zip ties and pieces of shrink wrap which was a nice bonus. The sheathing is a bit of a mixed bag for me. It's fairly thick and tough which is good, but the thickness does make it a bit less flexible than other wire of it's type I've used. It's also more rectangular than round so the flexibility suffers somewhat when trying to route it in tight spaces and makes it more difficult to use with a standard sheath cutter for round cable. The wire itself is good, the coating should help keep it from degrading over time. I would also prefer it came on a reel instead of wrapped and held with Velcro straps, but it's not a big deal. I have a bunch of reels from 3D printing filament and wound it up on one and it worked out well. So overall it's a good product for the dough.",

Does it work to conduct electricity? Yes. So I guess that's what you want from wire. According to the box, this wire is made of tinned copper, as opposed to bare copper. My understanding is that \"tinned copper\" (with a thin coating of tin around a copper wire) helps with resistance to oxidation, and is especially beneficial in high-moisture environments. This kit comes with a bag of small zip ties and a bag of heat-shrink tubing (looks like about 25 of each), as well as a small wire stripper, which is appreciated. So far, this wire is working well, and I am happy with this item.",

      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★☆ <b>Nice assortment of wire for electronics bench work; don't go by current rating provided, though</b> I'm a hobbyist maker who creates and repairs electronics, including microcontroller and IoT projects. Having an assortment of wire on hand helps ensure I'm using the right wire for the job both in function and appearance (color coding). This assortment includes 8 spools of silicone insulated 18AWG wire in different colors, along with heatshrink tubing and wire ties in matching colors which is a nice touch for neater, more professional looking wiring jobs. The spools are included in a box with holes to allow for dispensing, but the spools lay flat in the box -- not on edge like other boxes of dispensable wire I have. This isn't really an issue, just an odd choice and it makes the box a bit wider and flatter compared to a vertical orientation. Also included is a very basic wire stripper, though I don't use it as I have more capable wire strippers at hand. I would tend to challenge the specs/rating sheet included. Generally I wouldn't suggest anywhere near 22A be run through 18AWG wire. More like half that, tops. While the silicone insultation will help reduce the chance of fire from an over current situation compared to PVC or other materials, it will still get very hot and is a grossly inefficient application of power, with so much energy being lost as heat due to the resistance of the wire. Further, seeing the recommendation here could lead the inexperienced to conclude that's a safe current for any similarly sized wire. Otherwise, I'm quite satisfied with this product.",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★☆ <b>Mostly meets expectations, a few inches short, and dispensing box fail</b> This appears to be good tinned coppy wire, with silicone insultion as described. I only have two issues with this and would probbaly have dinged a 1/2 star if that was an option: I measured one of the rolls to see if I was getting 20ft, and it came up about 4 inches short. This isn't too bad for 20ft, but I expect to get every inch I paid for. Now maybe some of the other rolls were longer, but I didn't verify. If that is the case then they need to be more consistant. The second issue involves using the box as a \"dispenser\". THere are holes in the back of the box to feed the wire. The problem is if you put all 6 spools in side by side, then there isn't enough room to close the lid or for the spools to spin. They came packed with the spools in a 2x3 configuration instead of the 1x6 configuration you would use for dispensing. This is because they don't fit otherwise. Looks like good wire. So if you dn't mind being shorted a couple of inches, and don't need the dispenser to work well with 6 rolls of wire, and otherwise this is a good value for you, then this is your product. Oh yeah, it comes with some colored zip ties. <shrug> Price as reviewed $32.99 NAOEVO 16 Gauge Wire 120ft, 16 AWG Silicone Wire 20ft Each Spool, 6 Colors Flexible Tinned Copper Wire Electrical Wire 16 Gauge, Hookup Wire Kit for Breadboard/Automotive/DIY/Battery, 200℃ 600V",

Great for vehicle wiring or anything really. Even came in a reusable anti stat bag, has some zip ties and shrink tubing.",
      "B0B15DXZHJ ★★★★★ <b>Excellant Product</b> Wire itself is nice enough. The dispenser box is GREAT. Additional items (heat-shrink tubing and cable ties) are very useful.",
      "B0CV7XP7JN ★★★★★ <b>16 Gauge 3 Conductor Electrical Wire</b> This electrical wire has many applications. Electrical wire is rated by gauges and the larger the number the smaller the wire. For example, a 16 gauge wire is larger than an 18 gauge wire and will carry more amperage. The three stranded conductors are enclosed in a black PVC jacket. It was used to conduct electricity from a solar panel to charge the batteries on a light located some distance apart. This low voltage application worked and the batteries on the light charged. Enclosed with the wire are cable ties and heat shrinkable tubes to facilitate further applications.",
      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★☆ <b>Nice looking cable</b> Right out of the box/bag I was impressed with this wire. They certainly paid attention to the presentation. It has a shiny outer jacket, it comes with two velcro straps to keep it neatly coiled, it also has a baggie full of heat-shrink tubing and tie wraps. They even took the time to strip off about 2 inches of the outer jacket on either end of the cable and then stripped the ends of each individual wire. So good job to them for recognizing that presentation matters. The outer jacket is just a sleeve, it's not bonded to the wire like many others. I doubt that this is burial grade and the listing doesn't say that it is. The listing shows 12 volts, but if you strip back enough of the outer jacket, you can see that the wire itself has 600V and 105 degrees Celsius printed on it. For me, this wire is going to work great and I'm happy with it."

The home inspector we used seemed new to the business, at least that is what I'm chalking his performance up to. I am an electrician, so I know when electrical wiring is up to code and when it isn't. Unfortunately, my house is full of poor wiring, so I have been working on getting everything up to par before I need to use my generator for an emergency. The wire comes in a plastic-wrapped roll with a couple bands around it. I'm used to Romex coming in the plastic roll that you can pull out of the middle, but this wasn't as easy as that. The wire is pliable, as I would expect 14 gauge wire to be, and it stripped well. I had to pull a number of lengths through flexible conduit and it was just stiff enough to push through without a fish tape if the conduit was straight. Overall, I give this wire high marks. I did not encounter any of it that had poor craftmanship, it works great for 15A circuits, and I haven't had an issue after using about 150 feet of it. I will order more and keep it on hand."

I tend to order BNTechGo as I tried them once and was plenty happy with it. This stuff seems just as good as far as I can tell. My main concern was if it was real tinned copper or not so I stripped a section and scraped it with a sharp knife until I could clearly see the copper start showing through the tin. So yes, this is definitely real copper. The strands are extremely fine, which is great for flexibility but can make it tough to strip without cutting some. But that's the case with all flexible silicone wire, so no real issue there compared to other brands. These 10' sections came in just loose coils in a resealable pouch, which I guess is fine given how short they are; normally I prefer spools.

The wires inside the outer jacket are not bonded to the outer jacket, instead, they float inside the outer jacket. This allows the user to easily pull the wires out of the jacket as needed. This wire would make an excellent automotive or marine wire harness for multiple lights that require separate control. Overall, this 16/6 wire seems to be great wire with a durable outer protective jacket that makes it ideal for automotive and marine wire harnesses or for other low-voltage applications.",
      "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ <b>Works as described</b> Great amount of wire bundle with shrink tubing and zip ties. Works as described, many uses for low voltage projects. Recommended.",
      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★★ <b>Nice wire kit, great for hobbyists or experimenters, or even professionals.</b> This is a nice set of silicone insulated wire, which has a nice feel. This is the type of insulation which is soft, and can handle high voltages, and is the same type that is commonly used on probe leads for your multimeter. This wire is tinned, which makes it easier to solder to. Each roll is \"only\" 5 meters long. For some people, this will last forever. For others, this will go quickly. I opted for 22 gauge wire, because that's what I'd consider to be medium sized wire, for electronics work. The non-wire accessories are a nice addition, and I especially like that the heat shrink and wire ties are color coded.",
      "B0CN768S54 ★★★★★ <b>Great 5-stranded tinned copper wire, really high quality</b> I really like this wire. The packaging comes with several black zip ties and 6 pieces of heat shrink. The wire is tinned copper, so it is a little stiffer than finer stranded-wire. But it is going in an automotive application, and more durable wire is a necessity. The outer sheath is nice and thick and protects each individual wire very nicely. Overall, I am very pleased with it!"

The only thing is it doesn't come on a reel, it's just coiled up and wrapped in shrink wrap so you have to do some detangling to use it. So for the money it's a good deal and decent wire, just a little time consuming to get into a usable state.",
      "B0CNXJ9H6Q ★★★☆☆ <b>Bad manufacturing- buyer beware</b> The spool I received was in horrible shape. See pic. I can't provide a good review when I'm shipped defective product. The spool must have passed some inspector along the way. However, I can't imagine why they would pass such a bad spool of wire, especially when it is considered to be high quality OFC. Not recommending this manufacturer as there is no way of telling what a buyer will receive.",
      "B07T3B7C28 ★★★★☆ <b>Lack of spool matter more than I expected</b> I bought a 100-foot package of this in November 2021 (that length is no longer available). Sold by mfg, ship by Amazon. Seems like good wire for what it is. I was using it for doorbells and thermostats. It's solid core, very stiff, which suited my purposes. Stripped easily. The only reason I don't give it five stars is, it came in bag, as just a coil of wire, without any spool or anything. Originally, I didn't think that would matter. But when running the wire, the unmanaged coil kept getting tangled. I eventually restored to unwinding it all by hand, laying it out flat, up a staircase and down a hall. If I knew what a pain it was going to be, I would have bought a more expensive product on a spool. Live and learn. Too bad, seems like a decent product.",

      "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ <b>Quality wire in a durable jacket</b> I acquired this cable to wire some repair some existing lights and add supplemental warning lights on my tractor. Wire for rear tractor lighting needs to be run along the underside where brush, sticks, briars claw away at it constantly. More than once, I have had wiring damaged or destroyed. I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications. I really like this wire, and I look forward to using it to upgrade my tractor warning lights in preparation for spring. It would be equally suitable for use on a mowers or trailers as well. I think this product will provide adequate protection for wiring in a tough environment for a long time. In fact, with good end connections, I am hopeful that it will last as long as the equipment.",
      "B01MEDAG4L ★★★★★ <b>Excellent wire but READ the description</b> First off, this is excellent wire. The insulation is thick and supple and the wire takes solder very well. I neglected to read the description closely though - I though this was a spool of two wires attached. It's actually two LOOSE wires wrapped around the same spool. Not the fault of the product in any way, though I have to wonder why they would package it this way. Just a heads up for anyone who's looking for two connected wires side by side - this isn't it.",

This was good enough for my both thermostat.",
      "B0CKTBGCXV ★★★★☆ <b>12 gauge speaker wire does the trick</b> We've used this 50 foot roll of HiFind double 12 gauge electrical wire on several projects, include a short run for high powered speakers and to repair a 12 volt lamp. It's aluminum with copper clad construction ( a thin copper coating), so less expensive than pure copper and nearly as good for our purposes, for less than 50 cents per foot. As seen in the photos, this 50 foot coil of wire did not come on a spool. Not a bad product, would purchase again.",

      "B0C5BLQ327 ★★★★☆ <b>Good wire, tightly spooled package</b> The quality of the wire is good and it is just what you would expect. I was a little disappointed at how tightly wrapped the wire was because it will make it harder to straighten out and pull nicely through holes in the framing. I got this small size to pack away in my vehicle for unexpected use, but I would probably just cut of a piece from a larger roll in the future to make installs go a little smoother.",

The wire that you get is not what is shown in the photo - I got a broken plastic, tightly wound spool of wire, that I'm sure is off-brand. The jacket is low-quality and easily damaged. When you strip the wire ends, you'll break off the conductor more often than not. Save your money and do the job once.",
      "B0C5BLQ327 ★★★★☆ <b>Seems Standard</b> Just needed a short length of 12/2 to extend some outlets in a garage. This seems indistinguishable from the Romex I’d buy at the local home center. Maybe a bit more tightly wound for packaging purposes.",
      "B0CSD3GJ53 ★★★★★ <b>Very flexible and good polarity marking - ETL rated and marked</b> This cable is very flexible at 70 degrees F - more so than other brands I have used. The polarity marking ridges are also more prominent than other brands (if polarity is important for your installation). It is not on a reel which could make installation a little frustrating (a loose coil of wire can be a pain to unroll and roll back up without a reel). If you need wire for your landscape lighting project, and 100 feet is sufficient, give this consideration.",
      "B0CLBHT8YX ★★★★☆ <b>Quality wires. Wrapping is a little sloppy.</b> The wire itself is good quality. Consistent color and thickness of insulation across each roll. Insulation cuts cleanly and easily. Wire solders securely and has low resistance in use. My only complaint is that the small spools are wound a little sloppily. It wouldn't matter that much except that increases the possibility of tangles. The box makes dispensing small amounts easy.",
      "B0BPQDDNBV ★★★★☆ <b>50' of 16/3 copper conductor wire.</b> I ordered this for creating wiring harnesses in different automotive applications. Would have been nice if this wire came on a spool. Instead it arrived neatly looped in a coil, wrapped in shrink wrap to protect the jacket. Seems to be of decent quality.",
      "B0CKTBGCXV ★★★★☆ <b>Doesn't come on a spool</b> I feel like the ad is a little deceitful considering they show the wire on a spool, which is a lot easier to manage when dealing with a lot of wire, but when it arrived it was just a bunch of wire rolled up and held with twist ties. I got the 50ft roll so I don't know if its different for the larger sizes or not. The wire itself though is flexible and easy to separate by hand. I am using this to run new lines for my speakers in my f150 as they are notorious for not leaving any slack in their wiring harnesses and causing issues with wires rubbing at the door and breaking."

      "B0793MRX91 ★★★★★ <b>Extremely pleased</b> I recently purchased a spool of hookup wire and I am extremely pleased with its quality and performance. The wire is very flexible and easy to work with, making it perfect for a variety of electrical projects. The insulation on the wire is also very durable and has held up well under various conditions. One of the things I appreciate most about this hookup wire is its versatility. It can be used in a variety of applications including wiring for electronics, audio and video equipment, and even automotive projects. The wire is also very well-shielded, which helps to reduce interference and signal loss. The wire came nicely packaged in a spool and it was easy to unravel and use without getting tangled or knotted. The wire was consistent in gauge and color throughout the entire spool. Overall, I would highly recommend this hookup wire to anyone in need of a high-quality, versatile, and reliable electrical wire. It is a great value for the price and I will definitely be purchasing more in the future.",
      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★★ <b>Handy wire dispenser.</b> This collection may not be the cheapest way to purchase 18 gauge wire but it certainly qualifies as the handiest. The eight spools of wire lay flat in the provided box and rotate as you pull wire through the eight small exit holes cut in the box. Not only is the wire easy to pull and use but the spools are very neat and tidy for quick storage. I build small electric vehicles (e-bike, trikes, scooter, ride on toys ) and the availability of 8 colors makes wiring far easier to track and identify. Nice little kit for the hobby builder/maker.",

It comes neatly spooled and held in place with three velcro wire wraps (a nice bonus, since I use those with all sorts of stuff). The wires can be pulled apart very easily, without any fear of exposing copper, for applications where you don’t need three or where the wires terminate in different places. My only caution is to double check the gauge requirement for your application. These are very thin wires. They’re supposed to be that thin, but if you’re not well acquainted with electrical hardware, you might accidentally order these for the wrong application. Know up front how much current you’ll be running (and how far) so that you don’t burn something down. In my application, I was mostly wiring LEDs, which draw a tiny current.",
      "B0CKTBGCXV ★★★★★ <b>Great wire with great insulation</b> I got this wire to use on my pontoon boat and it will definitely do the job. 75ft of 14/2 AWG positive and negative wire will do a lot of LED lighting jobs on my boat. This is offered at a very reasonable price considering how much wire costs these days. I was really surprised at how thick the insulation is on this wire when I received it. It will hold up to all the abuse I'll be putting it through using my boat at least once a week year round. The spool the wire comes on is actually pretty nice too. It's not as thin and easy to break as some of the spools you get at the big home improvement stores. I wish it had a way to keep the wire from unspooling but that's easily remedied by tucking the wire in to itself. Overall great wire at a good price!",

      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★☆ <b>Its Wire.</b> Even though my brain could read 14 awg, my brain also thought this was a larger gauge based on the photos...LOL First why 15'? Even if thats all you need, what a waste of shipping 100' / 200' / 300' would be way more acceptable. The wire coating is nice, a bit soft for most of my applications, I generally prefer a stiffer more abrasion resistant wire, but the temp rating makes up for that. The included spools are nice, but opening is too small to fit my wire spool rack. Overall this size and length would be great for use in wiring aux lights, or running from a fuse panel to an accessory within the inside of a vehicle.",

      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Quality 12 gauge wire</b> The Fipnot spools of five assorted colors of wire is a nice kit of electronics projects. Each spool is 10 feet of wire and is individually wrapped. The wire is very flexible, and the silicone jacket is smooth which which makes it easy for passing this wire through tight spaces. This is stranded and tinned copper wire which has some benefits over stranded copper alone, such as better corrosion resistance and better soldering.",
      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★★ <b>Great Hobbyist Kit for Arduino/Control Systems</b> I think this kit is useful for arduino or control system projects, where it may be confusing to only see red/black wires everywhere. It makes it less painful to trace wires to their appropriate I/O (e.g. motors, buttons, etc). The box having holes for each spool is a creative touch that makes it trivial to pull out wire without having to actually open the box. The additional wire stripper was unnecessary to add, but a nice touch for hobbyists who might not have a lot of equipment. It takes a few attempts to figure out the right technique for stripping the wire, but it is definitely usable in place of a dedicated wire stripper. The wire itself was as-advertised and the high voltage and amperage rating makes this suitable for almost all use cases (beyond excessive power delivery).",

Thx to Sebastien from Canada for that hot tip All in all, a great product.

The outer PVC insulation is thick but flexible and has very little coil memory once straightened. The 22 AWG stranded copper conductors are nicely tinned, and flows solder nicely. Both the outer jacket and wire insulation are easily stripped with a quality tool and I did not experience any issues with broken conductors. The black/red/yellow conductors are convenient for many applications that have power/ground/control requirements within the 300V 2.2A rating. The -40℃ to + 80℃ temperature range also make it suitable for most DIY projects. The 22 AWG conductors are perfect for DuPont connectors, which are convenient for jumper wires, electronic projects, and testing.",

Im currently using it to connect a bunch of ground rods together , and so far I've been happy with it and the shielding is decent it is thick enough to do the job. I would also like to mention that the wire was wound neatly onto the spool and that spool itself is pretty nice and is reusable .",

      "B0CWNBZ164 ★★★★★ <b>Low voltage applications</b> It is suitable for my low voltage robotic applications, 24vdc or less. So far I have been able use about a foot or two to finish my current project. Comes on a handy reel that makes it easy to deploy for long runs. They packaged it in an anti-static, resealable bag.",
      "B0CN316VHN ★★★★☆ <b>Good for a wide variety of low voltage applications</b> First of all, note that this wire is intended for low voltage applications, including outdoors. The insulation is rugged PVC so it can be buried or exposed to wet conditions. It should not be used for 120v AC wiring. I confess that I intend to use this indoors for LED strip lighting, so the 16 gauge is overkill for me. I have complete confidence that my uses will be handled with no problem by this wire. The wire is sent on a convenient spool. One strand has smooth insulation and the other is ribbed for easily keeping the polarity right. The smooth strand has the labelling in white. The spool and the wire are both labelled as UL listed. I give it five stars because it is built for wet and outdoors conditions, and thus is more versatile.",
      "B0C65LQYPP ★★★☆☆ <b>Possibly decent wire, but unclear on ratings.</b> So IF the wire is as listed, this is a pretty nice value for what you get. Let me break it down with Good and Bad. Good: - Comes on a spool and is tidy for easy removal and use. - Has length markings every foot, counting down from 100' so you know how much you have left. Nice! - Sheath material easy to work with and strip, as are the wires themselves. Bad: - The listing shows \"CL2/CL3 rated\". Well which is it? Neither the spool or the wire say anything about the rating, except for the spool which mentions 12 and 24 volts DC. No amperage given, which is possibly to be expected for speaker wire. - Additionally the listing mentions Direct Bury, which again, is not listed on the wire or spool. It has no filling in the sheath, and looks like no direct bury wire I have ever used. I am skeptical. - Frankly the overall lack of assurance that the wire is rated as it says it is in the listing is a problem for me. NOW IF it is indeed as the listing claims, then this is pretty nice two conductor wire and a good deal. Know what you are getting, and if it matches your need. The wires ARE aluminum, but clad with copper. If you want straight copper, look elsewhere. I would be careful in recommending this to a friend.",
      "B0C84BL61V ★★★★★ <b>Nice assortment of flexible wire</b> I ordered the 16AWG wire and overall I'm very pleased with it. The wire is very flexible and appears to be sized correctly. The conductors are tinned copper (not copper coated aluminum) as described and there are a large number of individual conductors - helping considerably to make the wire as flexible as it is. The insulation appears and feels to be silicone (also as described). The colors are also vibrant as in the description. One nice feature is that each spool of wire is individually labelled - so once these leave their original box and I pick up a spool in 6 months I won't be wondering whether the wire is 14, 16 or 18 AWG - the spool is clearly labeled 16AWG. Overall I don't see anything at all wrong with this wire and give it five stars.",
      "B073RDG2J6 ★★★☆☆ <b>Not quite as described. Hoping for best.</b> Update: I do now see some info on the insulation. The AWG and 200 deg C. But no voltage rating is marked. I'm worried that the wire doesn't have any specifications printed on the insulation. I would have thought that was a requirement. Nothing on the carton, nothing on the spools. The carton has check boxes for what gauge wire is inside. None was checked so I guess I'll have to trust I got 18AWG. Additionally the carton says silicone on one end and PVC on the other. It's described in this listing as silicon rubber. So I did I get what I bought? I needed to replace some wiring in a 1981 amplifier I'm upgrading. The loom I'm rebuilding is getting very thick now due to insulation diameter. Time will tell if it was good a choice.",
      "B079NXCN6B ★★★★★ <b>Choose Your Location Well</b> Choosing a strategic location for the Ghost Wire can affect its visibility. I tried to butt it against corners, door frames, and base board to minimize its visibility. Likes: It gets the job done without needing to drill through walls, floors, or ceilings and then \"fish\" for speaker wire behind the wall or between joists; After working out the first connection to a terminal, the rest of them were easy to do; When I connected my speakers, it worked the first time and I have had no problems with the sound; Without doing any feathering or texturing, It took a coat of paint and matched the existing wall color perfectly (I have to point out the tape to people in order to get them to notice that it's there.) Dislikes: Although we had freshly painted walls (professionally done), the adhesive likes to come loose in a few places even though it was thoroughly pressed against the wall upon installation (It's not the worst thing in the world but I don't like to see any gap between the tape and the wall); I needed a little more Ghost Wire than was on the 100' reel so I ordered another 25' which is not on a reel and had a lot more bubbling (didn't easily lay flat on the wall); At over a buck per linear foot, it is a bit too pricey to use in every room; the folded corners do have a tendency to stand out, literally. NOTE: You still need speaker wire to run from the terminals to the speakers (I have wall mounted speakers and use about 1 foot of regular wire per speaker) and from the terminals on the other end to the amplifier or other source. If you order banana plugs (either solid or braided wire) with the terminals, the plugs do not fit into the holes in the terminals and you have to use bare wire. If they would manufacture the terminals with slightly larger holes, it would be excellent. Maybe someday they will.",
      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Silicone Copper Wire</b> Measured one roll using floor tiles. Came out about 2 inches short of the 50ft, but I can probably chalk that up to my own error, or too small to care about. Both rolls were same size/weight. Silicone insulation is soft. Can be stripped with just fingernails. The wire is very fine, tinned, and copper. Photo shows after fire test. Wire bundle matches my 20 AWG stripper, so that seems accurate too. Reels are nicely wound, and marked clearly with color/gauge.",
      "B0CN2RB68V ★★★★★ <b>Great for small wiring stations</b> Everything is organized very well in this set. Each color wired spool is individually wrapped and the box has a dispenser hole for each spool to feed each wire for easy length dispensing. The set also includes some zipties to help with any wire management needs and some heatshrink tubing for after your strip the wire jackets or solder. The core is tinned copper which looks to be good quality so conduction and signal stability shouldn't be a problem. I'd like to see more size options, but this set is a really good deal for what you get.",
      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★☆ <b>Great wire. I wish they were packaged in a different shape box dispenser.</b> I like silicone insulated copper wire from my projects. Is very flexible and can handle heat if necessary. Eight different colors is great for identifying circuitry. The eight little spools of wire Come in A box with eight holes around the edges that theoretically would allow you to dispense the wire without opening the box. The box is designed so that the spools lay on their sides. Four wires come out of each side. This means you can't leave the box on the shelf and just pull out the wire you want. I would have preferred to see these spools organized on edge where all eight spools could be accessed from just one side of the box. Aside from the box, the wire itself is very good.",
      "B0069F4HHC ★★★★★ <b>Works great!</b> What can I say? It's thermostat wire and it works great! I have no complaints, I was able to run it fine, hook it up to my furnace and thermostat and everything is working great. The wire does arrive on a spool, not in a rolled up loop as shown in the picture.",
      "B0C84BL61V ★★★★★ <b>Very flexible, thick insulation.</b> This is good wiring for adding accessories to a vehicle, running to speakers, etc. The wire is on very compact spools so it does not need a lot of storage. The wire is also very flexible so it will be easy to run through tight spaces or around tight corners. The outer insulation is nice and thick, and the conductors themselves seem to be of high quality. With a very low price at the time I ordered, these are also an excellent value.",
      "B07G2BWBX8 ★★★★★ <b>Super flexible wire! Worked great!</b> The project I was working on had very little room in the enclosure and I needed to wire up 15 different components. This wire blew me away with how flexible it is! I was able to effortlessly solder and pack all of my components together, the other wire I was using wouldn't have stood a chance in the enclosure. I love the packaging for this wire too, the box functions as a spool holder and the wire stays secure inside of it, just pull on the strands that you poke out of the box when it's time to use them!",
      "B09X45RZCQ ★★★★★ <b>Very Flexible Wire</b> I have purchased 3 sized of this wire for various electronics projects: 26, 28 and 30 AWG. Overall, I have been very satisfied with this wire. The insulation is thick and won't easily split. The stranded wire is very flexible and easy to strip off. Comes in 10 colors each on a seperate reel. Once you remove the shrinkwrap, the wire does tend to want to unwind off the spool, but such is the nature of this wire. The only regret I have is that I was not offered a choice of colors. I would have much preferred to have a spool of Gray wire over Pink for example.",
      "B0D1H6K1X1 ★★★★★ <b>Well packaged and unwound with no issues.</b> Came spooled and taped in a box. De-spooled with no snarls.",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Super flexible</b> This collection of 16 ga. wire (6 spools-20ft. per spool) is great to have on hand for any automotive or RV repair. The wire is super flexible due to the silicone insulation and the multi-strand wire. The wire solders easily though the twisted strands should be tinned before soldering. I twisted the strands and crimped 16 ga. connectors. The twisted wires fit the connectors and crimped properly. I could not pull the connection apart. It would have been nice to have had a hole in the spool to keep the wire from de-reeling, but an 11/64 drill bit took care of that. The seller specs the current rating at 20 amps-600 volts AC. 16 ga. wire in 12VDC applications ranges from 8 to 10 amps depending on length, and 13 amps in AC applications.",
      "B07T5JWRB6 ★★★★★ <b>As Described</b> Came bundled and in a package, not on a spool. Works great and as described. Seemed cheaper than I could find elsewhere.",
      "B085SV67Y2 ★★★★★ <b>Good price compared to eBay</b> It is what it says it is. One complaint I have is the wire constantly comes uncoiled. Putting a slight notch in the lip of the plastic spool helps to lock the wire in place when storing so it doesn't \"spring out\" from the spool. Easy to cut, solder, bend.",
      "B0C65LQYPP ★★★★★ <b>Excellent speaker wire</b> Received the wire in a spool today. 14-2. Insulated in white ourter viny. Good quality copper wire. I'll be using for my speakers, but this will work on any small projects, such as 5V solar panel. Feels solid.",
      "B0C4XDJDN4 ★★★★★ <b>Good Quality, Works Well</b> This spool of wire was wound neatly and free from any tangles. The quality of this is just as good as the name brand from your local hardware supply store and works just as well. I haven't had any issues since using it and so far am happy with the results.",
      "B0CK4WHWBY ★★★★★ <b>Good 3-conductor wire for LED strips</b> This is great 3-conductor wire for LED strips, like WS2811 LEDs. The three conductors all share a common outer jacket that is rated for outdoor use (waterproof, burial). The colors are red/black/yellow, so it doesn’t use the common WS2811 color schemes, but that doesn’t matter. Each strand is 18 AWG, and should be able to safely carry up to about 12 amps. It’s just the wire cut straight off the spool, so you will need to be ready to strip and prep the ends yourself, but that’s exactly what’s expected for this. Very satisfied, 5 stars.",
      "B088QJKKML ★★★★★ <b>Good wire</b> I need this wire for various small wiring repairs or short lengths of wire in various colors. The wire jacket seems study and it has enough flex to it but can hold a shape if needed. I like that each color of wire comes on a spool so I can put the dowel rode in them on this wire spool rack I made.",
      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★★ <b>Nice selection of wire for small projects.</b> This is a very nice selection of wire for small low current projects like hooking up switches to power control relays or indicator light wiring. The wire comes wound on individual reels and they can be threaded through holes in the box for easy dispensing. The kit also included a basic wire stripper and an assortment of shrink tubing in different colors. The wire and insulation coating look like good quality. Recommended.",
      "B01KCPKRHS ★★★★★ <b>Good spool</b> wires were separate from each other. I liked that",
      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★★ <b>Nice wire</b> I can always locally find red and black wires, if I'm lucky, I can also find green. However, vehicle wiring comes in many many more colours. This kit is just what I needed. The box itself acts as a dispenser for the wires so you can keep every colour organised on its spool without it unwinding on you. My only issue with this design is, with the wire inside the box, you can't see how much you have left. With some colours, 16ft goes quickly. I absolutely enjoy the colour matching zip ties and heat shrink. I hate putting black heat shrink on coloured wire. Drives me crazy. When I first opened the box, I laughed at the wire stripper. I was going to bash it, but honestly, it's not bad. Works better and safer than me pushing wire between my thumb and pocket knife blade. The wire I show in the picture was stripped using the wire strippers provided. There are four different sized slots on the strippers for four different sized wires, but they aren't labelled, so be sure to double check before cutting in. The insulation on the wire is thick and flexible. The wire itself is flexible as well. I haven't noticed any issues quality control.",

      "B000VHDRDO ★★★☆☆ <b>Hard to strip</b> The coating is basically welded to the wires. So much extra work and time to strip the wires. If you are doing a small project then whatever, but I would never wire a whole house with this stuff. It would be so frustrating.",
      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★☆ <b>Nice looking cable</b> Right out of the box/bag I was impressed with this wire. They certainly paid attention to the presentation. It has a shiny outer jacket, it comes with two velcro straps to keep it neatly coiled, it also has a baggie full of heat-shrink tubing and tie wraps. They even took the time to strip off about 2 inches of the outer jacket on either end of the cable and then stripped the ends of each individual wire. So good job to them for recognizing that presentation matters. The outer jacket is just a sleeve, it's not bonded to the wire like many others. I doubt that this is burial grade and the listing doesn't say that it is. The listing shows 12 volts, but if you strip back enough of the outer jacket, you can see that the wire itself has 600V and 105 degrees Celsius printed on it. For me, this wire is going to work great and I'm happy with it."

They closely replicate the original cloth-covered power cords of the 1920s and '30s. The Rayon cover of this cord will fray when cut so you may want to do the following for best results when cutting and terminating the wire. before cutting the wire use a match or small heat gun to \"cook\" the rayon about 1.25 inches long. Cut the cord in the center of the melted area then use a good wite stripper to remove the insulation. Be sure to leave some of the melted rayon behind or the rayon will fray and make a mess. If the outer rayon does fray don't touch it, just hit it with a match or lighter flame and it will self seal as it melts. The rayon is thin so don't overdo it with the heat or it will melt holes in it. If you are replacing an old power cord add a fuse holder with a properly sized fuse to the device you are repairing to make it safer. Overall this cord looks and works great!",
      "B0BRN8DWTL ★★★★★ <b>Beautiful appearance and high quality vintage style appliance wire</b> I was immediately struck that the cloth covering on this wire is so aesthetically pleasing. It looks and feels great to the touch; much better than the cloth covered wire from back in the day. I suspect the reason is that the modern 'cloth' contains some synthetics that weren't available 75 years ago. But this wire fits in fine with genuine vintage items, and this cloth is much more durable than the old stuff. I will be using it to rewire an old vintage lamp to get rid of the vinyl/plastic modern wire. I think it is a good choice to re-wire a valuable antique item as well. This wire is flexible but not as limp as most appliance wire. At first I thought the reason must be solid copper instead of stranded copper inside, which would be very strange. It's stranded not solid, however, and the lack of limpness is because the black-coated and white-coated copper stranded wires inside are embedded in a PVC 'cord' that is completely solid. In other words, there isn't a PVC tubing containing the 2 inner wires but rather a solid mass of PVC. Thus the whole thing is sturdier and heftier than it would be if it were a cloth covering over a PVC tubing containing 2 wires. Well done, as the resulting heft makes this wire seem substantial which adds a beautiful aesthetic to any vintage item. Once my re-wiring job is done if I learn any more I'll come back and edit this review."

      "B0CH861BMS ★★★★★ <b>Looks like great, durable wire</b> The outer coating on this stuff is super thick. The diameter is right at about 6mm. It looks like it will be extremely durable. It does make the wire bigger overall, though, if that matters for the particular use case. For me it doesn't, so I'm happy with it. I must admit I had quite a lot of trouble stripping this wire at first. Traditional strippers that have a sharpened hole certainly wouldn't work due to the two conductors inside occupying more space in one direction than another. I tried cutting them carefully with a sharp knife and ended up cutting into the inner conductors despite my care. I think the trick is to either have some nice wire strippers that have the two heads that pull apart, which mostly work, or using a sharp knife in concert with bending the wire away from the cut so it pulls itself apart when split. A dismantling tool also works fairly well, though is harder to keep as pretty. The self-adjusting stripper is the easiest way and makes a decently clean separation, but is a bit fickle at the size and stretchiness of the outer layer. I was slightly confused that the wire fit inside an 18awg ferrule, thinking they may have undersized the wire, but I tried another 16 gauge wire I had in hand and it did too. So no worries, I think. Anyway, this is nice stuff that I'd have no problem recommending.",
      "B0CH861BMS ★★★★☆ <b>UL Listed 16 Gauge.</b> Traditional lamp cord is made of 2, 18 gauge wires that are split down the middle. Also called SP-1 wire. SP-1 and SP-2 wire has a thick sheath around each conductor that allows it to be used for high voltage, low amperage appliances. This wire is 16 gauge but it's sheathing is thin so it is limited to low voltage applications. The wires are copper and that's a good thing but this is not rated for burial so it cannot be outdoors. Here are, however, a few things you can do with this wire.

      "B0C9D4VCK7 ★★★★★ <b>Nice wire, flexible.</b> Flexible, decent, 18/2 wire. Strips fairly easy, takes solder well. Excellent addition to the hobby bench.",
      "B0BGS5GRSK ★★★★★ <b>Reliable and Versatile</b> I recently purchased the 18 Gauge Wire 2 Conductor Electrical Wire for my automotive and lighting projects, and I am extremely satisfied with its performance. This wire is perfect for low voltage applications, such as automotive wiring, LED strips, lamp lighting, and marine projects. Therefore, I am giving it a five-star rating. The wire is made of high-quality 18 AWG stranded PVC cord, which provides excellent flexibility and durability. I have found that this flexibility makes it easy to route the wire in tight spaces and around corners without any issues. Additionally, the stranded construction ensures that the wire is resistant to breakage and can withstand the rigors of demanding applications. The tinned copper conductors are another great feature of this wire. The tinning process adds a layer of protection to the copper, making it more resistant to corrosion and extending the lifespan of the wire. This is particularly important for marine applications, where exposure to moisture and saltwater can be a concern. The 18/2 wire configuration, with two conductors, is suitable for a wide range of electrical projects. It allows for easy connection of various components, such as LED strips, lamps, switches, and more. The wire is color-coded, with one conductor in red and the other in black, making it simple to identify and connect the positive and negative terminals correctly. The length of the wire, 100ft (30.48m), provides ample supply for most projects, allowing for flexibility in routing and installation. The wire is neatly packaged and easy to handle, without any tangles or kinks. I have used this wire extensively in my automotive projects, and it has performed flawlessly. The low voltage rating of 12V ensures safe and reliable operation without any risk of electrical hazards. The wire's insulation is of high quality and provides excellent protection against short circuits and electrical interference. Overall, the 18 Gauge Wire 2 Conductor Electrical Wire is a reliable and versatile option for various electrical applications. Its flexibility, tinned copper conductors, and durable construction make it ideal for automotive, lighting, marine, and other low voltage projects. I would rate this wire five out of five stars for its quality, performance, and versatility. It has met and exceeded my expectations, and I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable and durable electrical wire for their projects.",
      "B0CH861BMS ★★★★★ <b>Great 2-conductor wire!</b> I love this kind of wire! It's two wires, essentially, with a protective PVC sheathe. I love this stuff because it removes the need for corrugated PVC split-loom. The sheathe acts to protect the wires against abrasion, and if you're running wire in vehicles, with all of their tight turns and sharp edges, you need abrasion protection. I got this to run accessory LED lighting for my Jeep. I will likely use this to replace some regular 2-conductor wire that doesn't have the sheathe which is currently run to my LED pods, and I plan to install an LED light bar as well. There's some additional wiring for various accessories that I'd like to replace with this: I'm basically redoing all of my fun project wiring with this stuff. The individual wires are 16 gauge, which should be plenty to handle the power draw of LED lighting. Overall, this is good wire. For the price you get a decent length, and if it behaves like others of its kind, should last a long, long time.",

      "B0CSD3GJ53 ★★★★☆ <b>ETL listed, just like regular zip wire but 12 gauge</b> With spring headed our way, we're beginning to plan for some landscaping improvements in our yard, and low-voltage lighting is one of the things I'd like to add, so I picked up this wire. This wire looks like your typical lamp cord/zip wire, but at 12 gauge, this is pretty stout wire. Like zip wire, the two conductors are insulated in black flexible rubber insulation and joined by a thin section of rubber in the middle, so you can easily split the two conductors apart for making any necessary connections. And like typical zip wire, one of the conductors is identified by ribbing on the exterior of the insulation; this conductor is used, by convention, as the neutral wire. I've learned the hard way that before you put any wire into service, check it for breaks. Both conductors in this 100 foot spool passed the continuity test. What else is there to like? They include a chart (see photo) that shows the maximum wattage for any given length and gauge of wire, so it's nice to have that as a handy reference. It's also ETL listed (sort of like UL listed). For low voltage applications like landscape lighting, you could argue that being ETL listed is overkill, but it's a nice thing to have regardless since it is rated for up to 300 volts. One minor nit--I wish that they had length markings on the wire like some wires do--once you start using this, it's nice to be able to know how much length is remaining without having to unspool it and find it's not enough. Again, maybe overkill for a 100' spool but that would have been a really nice touch.",

One conductor is all red and the other has a black stripe on it. I am rewiring the compressor side of one of my Heat Pumps which requires 10 gauge wire as it draws 30 amps @ 120v. It's only a 7' run from the disconnect box so I can cut the wire in half and use one of the conductors from the second half as a ground. It's going in conduit so weather, elements and critters are of no consequence. Still, it's good to know I'm using very good wire.

I dont agree with the few negative reviews. It is not hard to strip and is not any stiffer than any other wire of this type. I like the rugged outer insulation that will protect the wires and make a neat install.",
      "B0CPPWBGT8 ★★★★★ <b>'Bout 60 Cent a Foot</b> This is nice 12 gauge tinned copper wire. The exterior insulation is the loose type - you could cut a piece and pull out a red or black to use as a single conductor. Last I saw 25 feet of Romex was selling for about 50 bucks at the big ugly orange store, at the time of this writing this is selling (with coupon and promotion code) for about 30 dollars. That's about 60 cents a foot for 2 conductor 12 gauge tinned copper wire. It doesn't have a ground wire, but I would be comfortable using it anywhere a ground was available nearby, and certainly if I didn't need the ground. This wire is rated for 300 volts. Don't know how it would fair for inspections, but I never cared for inspections - so, i just don't order any of those. 5 Stars for The Oududianzi 12 Gauge, 2 Conductor Tinned Copper Wire",

      "B0C2HS6QG5 ★★★★★ <b>True 10awg wire</b> This wire is true multi-strand, 10awg copper wire, not cheap aluminum and comes as duplex with both red and black cables. The outer shell isn’t silicone but isn’t overly rigid. It doesn’t appear that it is actual marine grade and the outer jacket doesn’t make that specification either. The jacket doesn’t conform perfectly to the copper wire and subsequently oxygen and moisture could get inside and cause corrosion if it’s not sealed properly. I’d feel comfortable using this cable anywhere that standard duty wiring was needed but I wouldn’t recommend using this in place of marine grade material that would be subjected to fuel or moisture. I don’t believe it would stand up to that kind of environment.",

      "B01MR7EKGO ★★★★★ <b>PERFECT in all ways.</b> I installed low voltage lighting (LVL) a couple of years ago, using wire bought at the local big box store. We decided recently to add to it, so I needed more wire. I was hesitant based on the price (almost half what it would cost locally). I was pleasantly surprised when we went to use it. Quality seems very good and two wires separated and stripped easily. Very much a pleasure to work with. We've had it in place a few months now and have experience extreme temps and rain. The wire has held up well. Will definitely buy again should I need more.",
      "B0CPPWBGT8 ★★★★★ <b>High Quality Roll of Copper Wire</b> We got the 50 ft length, 12 gauge roll of two conductor electrical wire. It's flexible and thin, and the PVC covering is waterproof. When cut, you will notice that each wire is tinned copper for excellent conductivity; one wire is red and one is black, and the PVC insulation is made to last. The set includes shrinkable tubes and cable ties. We are using this for low-voltage outdoor lighting, and it works great because it can be buried underground without fear of any damage.",
      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★★★ <b>Very flexible, resists abrasion and heat</b> This is the wire you want to use for charging lithium batteries. At 10 gauge there will be very little voltage drop between the power supply and the battery and digital voltage on the power supply will reflect the voltage on the battery. Amazon delivered this wire last night and I didn't find it till morning. The package was covered in snow and it was 20F. I opened the package, and this wire was as flexible as it could be. I started to make a cable with it and noticed the two wires split very easily, too easily. With only moderate use this wire will keep separating. The ends should always have a piece of heat shrink tubing at the ends to prevent it from becoming two wires, even when storing. That is partially an effect of the insulation being so flexible. From the picture you can see how many small flexible strands there are. I measured one with my caliper and the reading was 0.002 inches. This is really nice wire to work with because of the extreme flexibility. I took a piece of insulation and hit it with my soldering iron set to 593F. The insulation didn't burn, smoke or even make a dent. This is just super wire to use for higher current applications.",
      "B0B28M2C5K ★★★★★ <b>Best value 18 gauge 2 Stranded wire!</b> Nicely insulated 18 gauge 2 Stranded wire! At 0.45 cents per foot this is the best deal I know of.

It was harder than I expected (which is to say harder than other brands) to separate the two wires. I tried to pull it apart with my fingers but finally resorted to snipping the end with wire cutters to get the split started. Even after that, it was difficult to pull them apart enough to strip the ends. The wire is easy to strip. The wire is stranded copper and is very flexible. One of the strands has ridges down the side so it is easy to tell them apart when you get to the other end of the run. This is good wire and it will work perfectly for my application.",

      "B0CBMZGNFL ★★★★★ <b>Makes great speaker and undercar lighting wiring</b> Adding speakers to older cars and boats or installing undercarriage lights on atvs and pickups means running quite a bit of wire in places it was not originally placed. This pre-stranded paired wire gets you setup with speaker connections and good power and ground connections for multiple LED light pods and strips. The coating looks like it will hold up well in harsh climates and the cable flexes well for routing and door jamb operations. The small gauge makes it unsuited to higher current loads like pumps, compressors or high intensity lamps.",
      "B0C65LQYPP ★★★★★ <b>Nice sturdy wire.</b> I recently purchased the Askcable 16/2 AWG 100FT Electrical Wire for a speaker project I was working on, and it turned out to be just what I needed. This 16 gauge, 100 feet long, 2 conductor speaker wire with a CL2 rating was perfect for my outdoor setup. The white jacket gives it a clean look, and the fact that it's designed for direct burial in the ground made it easy for me to run the wire without having to worry about any additional protection. The wire itself felt solid and well-made, with red and black conductors clearly marked for easy installation. I used it as an extension cord cable to connect my speakers to my amplifier, and it worked flawlessly. The sound quality was great, and I didn't experience any distortion or signal loss at all.",
      "B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ <b>Excellent hook-up wire for outdoor and automotive projects.</b> This is good wire for low voltage projects around your house, barn, and garage. The outer sheath is very rugged and abrasion resistant and yet it strips easily so that you're not fighting with it, as you'll do with other types of two-conductor and sheathed wires. The two inner conductors will handle a modest amount of amperage such as for wiring up lights and similar electrical devices. Further, the inner conductors take solder well, but I'd advise that you use some flux to ensure that the solder adequately infiltrates between the wire strands.",
      "B0CPPWBGT8 ★★★★★ <b>Heavy duty 2-conductor wire!</b> I love this kind of wire! It's two wires, essentially, with a protective PVC sheathe. I love this stuff because it removes the need for corrugated PVC split-loom. The sheathe acts to protect the wires against abrasion, and if you're running wire in vehicles, with all of their tight turns and sharp edges, you need abrasion protection. I got this to run accessory LED lighting for my Jeep, but I'm considering it for running speakers as well. The individual wires are 14 gauge, which is more than enough for my craziest lighting project. 14 gauge can handle a lot of juice. Overall, this is good wire. For the price you get a decent length, and if it behaves like others of its kind, should last a long, long time.",
      "B0CRYX1P5T ★★★★★ <b>High quality zip type dual wire</b> This silicone wire in a dual wire setup colored red and black to designate the positive and negative side of the wire is a zip type where you can separate the two wires easily. The copper core wire with a tinned outer coating of each of the strands makes it very easy to solider onto connectors for a solid connection. The silicone outer coating doesn’t shrink when soldering onto a terminal making it much easier to work with especially in speaker connections or for DIY power projects like LED strip light installations. It does come wound on a spool to keep the wire organized and compact in a tool bag or on a spool holder for long wire runs and able to unwind easily. This is how high quality wire should be and would be the ideal wire to use in your next project.",
      "B0CKQ2172Z ★★★★★ <b>Great Price and Usage!</b> Fast next day delivery! I was able to install it with my new bookshelf speakers and pair it with my other old system speakers that used old wires (22 AWG). In total, I had two old speakers at the front next to my TV and two new speakers at the back all connected to one amplifier. Great price for the 100FT 2 Conductor Red Black Hookup Wire!",

Trust the 18 Gauge 2 Conductor Electrical Wire to deliver the power and reliability you need for your next wiring project!",
      "B09V56LTY5 ★★★★★ <b>Good copper electrical wire in 16AWG</b> The wire is as described and perform well. Two (red and black) wires with its own PVC insulation and there is a PVC outer jacket covering both. Wires are copper (NOT lower conductivity grade Copper Clad Aluminium). I made an actual count and there are exactly 27 strands. The outer jacket can be stripped off with wire stripper at 14AWG, which really indicate the wire is even slightly bigger than 16AWG. Nice wire, with good conductivity and well made. Excellent for extension or versatile use.",
      "B07Y7S1BRN ★★★★★ <b>Illuminate Your Landscape: Quality Wire for a Brilliant Outdoor Experience.</b> In the realm of outdoor landscaping projects, the quality of materials is paramount. And in our recent endeavor, the direct burial landscape light wire we procured became a star player. Boasting robust construction, it met our criteria both in terms of price and performance. The industrial-grade PVC insulation is a testament to its durability, ensuring longevity even in demanding outdoor conditions. As a 2-wire product, it further simplifies installations. A thoughtful touch is the distinctive design of each wire: one side is smoothly finished, while the other bears grooves, making identification a breeze during setup. However, there's one aspect where the product could be enhanced — its packaging. The wire is sheathed entirely in plastic, and accessing it requires completely removing this protective cover. This might sound like a minor quibble, but when you're deep into the intricacies of landscaping, unwrapping the wire can become a tangled chore, leading to unintended project delays. In conclusion, the landscape light wire has much going for it, and I'd consider repurchasing it for future projects. But a packaging redesign is to facilitate easier unspooling and more convenient storage.",
      "B0BYKB2PWS ★★★★★ <b>Just What I needed</b> I recently used UBOORY 16/2 Low Voltage Landscape Wire to install outdoor lighting around my water feature, and I must say I am impressed with its performance. This wire is made of high-quality materials, and the insulation is thick enough to protect it from the elements. The 16-gauge wire is perfect for low voltage landscape lighting, and the 2-conductor design is ideal for connecting multiple lights. I had no issues with the wire, and it was easy to cut and strip for connections. The installation was a breeze, and the lights look amazing. I am confident that this wire will last a long time and provide reliable power to my outdoor lighting. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase of UBOORY 16/2 Low Voltage Landscape Wire and would recommend it to anyone looking for high-quality landscape wire.",
      "B0CG9DWDK1 ★★★★★ <b>Well made and easy to see positive from negative on the entire length</b> I got this to do some rewiring of the 12v system in my camper. I am upgrading from 14 gauge to 12 gauge on a few circuits and this wire will work perfect for that. It is well made and the white lettering on one conductor is easy to see the entire length of the wire. Overall very happy with the run of cable!",
      "B0CH861BMS ★★★★★ <b>Good for specific uses</b> I am using this 2 conductor wire for low voltage outdoor wiring that is above ground. Unlike some low voltage landscape lighting cables, this does not look appropriate for direct burial. There are however, 2 layers of insulation to the cable: color coded (red and black) insulators on each conductor and a thicker protective insulator on the exterior. The wire gauge is quite light at #18, so it is especially good for LED lights which don't draw much current. I would also feel comfortable using it on a single halogen fixture at 20 watts or less. Overall the thin profile of the cable lends itself to being able to tuck it away easily and out of sight. I will likely be using it under a deck to power LV light fixtures.",
      "B0C4XDJDN4 ★★★★★ <b>Solid indoor power wire</b> This roll of cable comes in 100ft, in yellow jacket, which adheres to the standard of max 20A wire using yellow jacket. There are 2 conductors(black and white), plus a ground. They are all in solid copper wires. Good quality and good use indoor for pulling extra max 20A circuit to an outlet. Last but not least, it is UL listed, extra safety in mind. Basically, it meets my expectations as well as what it describes in the product description.",

The wiring itself is copper, so of course you know it's good for any type of material. The only issue with this is I didn't get it longer, but that's my own fault. Thanks.",
      "B0C9D4VCK7 ★★★★★ <b>Nice wire, quality outer sheathing</b> This bundle of wiring is dual-wire 18 AWG stranded tinned-copper wiring. The outer sheathing is really durable and flexible (as you can see in the picture). The inner sheathing around each individual wire strand is on the thinner side I thought. If you strip away the outer sheathing, I would definitely recommend using heat shrink or electrical tape to add a layer of protection to the inner sheathing. I wanted to see how this wire would do when it is cold, so I put the bundle in the freezer for an hour. It was obviously much stiffer when it was frozen, and it tended to hold its shape when bent; however even when it was frozen, the outer sheathing still allowed it to bend just as tightly as I showed in the one picture. The sheathing did not crack or discolor when it was frozen and bent this tightly. So I think that this wire will work well, even in cold-environment applications. Overall great bundle of wire, I plan to use it in an automotive application.",

I bought this product as I only needed about 15' to finish a project - the length was right and was far cheaper then anything else I found online or in store (HD, CTC, HH - Canada). UL rating should be fine in Canada. 1st - this wire is a much lighter wire and insulation then what should be the equivalent 12/2 NMWU. 2nd - the ground wire is molded into the sheathing making it difficult to separate and strip your hot and neutral wires (black, white). 3rd - this wire feels more rigid then 12/2 NMWU, making me wonder about copper content. And finally, this wire is rated for 600 V where 12/2 NMWU is rated for 300 V (as is 14/2 NMD90) - this does NOT change the Amperage rating. - so not sure why. Above is 14/2 NMD90 (top), UF-B 12/2 (middle) and 12/2 NMDU (bottom). I don't know if this is standard in the US, but as noted in previous review, the 25' seems inadequate.",

      "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>Works great for farm use</b> The RiteFENCE Electric Fence Double Insulated Underground Hard Cable is working perfectly for use 'underneath' my 12' and 16' foot double gates that lead to my pasture. For years I have used a system where I disconnect my electric fence by hand to open my gates without getting shocked. I dug a small trench about 6\" deep under a couple of my gates and buried the RiteFENCE, and left each end protrude out of the ground about two feet to connect to one of the lower existing fence wires so as not to disconnect the continuous circuit at any time when opening gates now. I chose the 6\" depth to bury the heavily insulated RiteFENCE since in addition to moving livestock through the gates, I also drive vehicles and farm implements through the gates as well. The RiteFENCE is very sturdy and rigid, and the 12-½ gauge took some time to straighten out to fit flat and neatly into the trenches I dug and placed the wire into, but this is a definite plus for electric fence wire to be used on a farm or ranch. The RiteFENCE doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and has a thick outer coating with the inner wire apparently coated as well for the 'double insulation' aspect. When installing, I also cut back a couple of inches of the RiteFENCE on each end and used a heavy duty crimp connection to the barb wire fencing I use. Once crimped, I neatly wrapped the connections with quality electrical tape to seal from the elements. The RiteFENCE is going to be ideal for many other underground connection needs I have around the farm. I would highly recommend any farmers and ranchers who run electric fence to give the RiteFENCE a try if you want to eliminate the risk of a nasty shock, especially with the higher powered fence chargers. The price point seems very fair and in fact is actually a little cheaper than what I saw at my local farm supply store. Highly recommend!",
      "B0C5BLQ327 ★★★★★ <b>Nice length for small project.</b> 25ft is not much, so if you are doing a small job it is great. 12guage is perfect as well for 20 amp breakers, and more than needed for 15 amps. This is a standard Romex style wire with vinyl outer sleeve and insulated individual wires, (white, black, and uninsulated ground.) I do wonder why we do not insulate our ground wires, but that is the standard here and I haven't seen any issues to date with that. Honestly, ground and neutral seem to be ok on the same ground blocks unless you feed into a sub panel where neutral and ground have to be on separate bus bars. Moving on from the lesson, I can say this is a good 12/2 romex that I can recommend that is also decently priced. Locally 15ft of 12/2 romex costs 28 dollars and 40 dollars for 25ft just to give some context on how good this is as a deal."

      "B0B9ZJ2LPR ★★★☆☆ <b>Great Idea, Poor Execution…</b> These do not fit in a 1-1/8” hole without hammering them in, which broke one of the green pieces initially. So what I ended up having to do is pop out each green piece and hammer in the metal ring before reinserting the green piece. I wish they were easier to install and the plastic insert had more of a rounded edge. They are still pretty sharp when pulling the wires through. Overall I’m still committed to using them, but there’s definitely opportunities for improvement.",
      "B0B24PNTRR ★★★★☆ <b>Can Be tight with 20 AWG Wire</b> Works good. However, with 20 gauge wire it can be difficult to insert the wire through the circular loops. If you push too hard it can deformed the plastic loops. Also, if you need to pull the wires back out for whatever reason after clamping down on the connectors, the plastic loop will actually pull the insulator off the wire. Not a big deal but it was a little annoying. I used this to connect LED strip lights to wires and it wasn't ideal and causes more problem than it should. My fault though... i should've used the right tool for the right job. For connecting wires, this is fine and works rather well. I imagine 22 AWG wire would be perfect."

This is a little on the stiff side but that is because it is quality wire and safe in all regards. It consists of two stranded copper wires, each housed in their own plastic casing and then both wires housed inside of another plastic casing, with the cloth on the outside. I have an old fan and some electric clocks that need new wires, so this is ideal to use. Very happy with this.",

The exterior coating is thick and it has an additional plastic layer + a plastic separator. It’s “exterior” for about 3” of wire on this run but I’m also going to run it direct-burial to my generator and I have confidence it will hold up. It fit standard Cat6 ends (barely). Standard tension guards also fit on the wire but once again, barely. My gripe is that there are defects on the individual wire sheathing (mostly green stripe). It’s bubbled and extra thick in places so if you accidentally find a piece like that, you lose 1 inch to 1 foot recutting the wire until you find an inch or two that will push into the connector. I can’t find this wire in black locally so I’m not complaining too much but be aware it’s frustrating and probably not what you want for your 10Gbps network. I’m using it to power/connect an exterior POE Wi-Fi AP and connect a generac generator and I’m confident that it will provide solid stable low-bandwidth connections.",
      "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>12 1/2 gauge class 3 galvanized steel cable, polyethylene coated.

I didn't end up going all the way around as I would normally do to strip a wire but was only able to take off a corner and that's all I wanted to try to do. It seemed more like one very thick layer, at least double normal wire insulation thickness, and much tougher. Polyethylene is not a cheap material. I expect to use a cutting wheel even to strip the ends. Inside is a single conductor which they say is galvanized steel, not the usual conductor materials of aluminum or copper. Copper would be way too expensive in this application. I suppose aluminum could crack. This is so thick it's hard for me to bend the cable with my hands.

      "B0CF55452S ★★★★☆ <b>Low voltage landscape copper wire</b> 16/2, 165ft - This is a competent product: labeling on the jacket says direct burial underground, and the insulation is relatively flexible at room temperature for stripping and bending. Stiffer in a colder outdoor environment. I did not measure the length to confirm advertised 165 ft though. Conductor appears to be pure copper strands, which is as claimed, not copper coated aluminum. The individual strands are quite fine. I counted 64 strands after stripping. Makes it very flexible and not likely to break after many and extreme bends. See photo. - Was easy to strip. - Actually the product seems fairly generic: there is no branding printed on the jacket nor any identification label on the roll. But you weren't expecting a mainstream brand anyhow, and it's just outdoor low voltage wire. It's fine. Looks like it will hold up in the garden. - One thing to keep in mind is that because it's bare copper wire (not tined, like marine wire) the connections are subject to corrosion from moisture and humidity. Make sure to use a connector method that either bonds the ends (solder) or creates a waterproof barrier to prevent this. - At the time I ordered the 16/2 165ft roll was $41, making it an okay deal, considering it's generic wire. - Hope this helps"

The copper stains are too thin to work-with, they are brittle to bend around a connection screw. Soldering is required to support the stains.

      "B0CPPWBGT8 ★★★★★ <b>Tinned copper 14 AWG conductors. Sheathing smooth and easy to pull.</b> This seems like good wire for outdoor and automotive applications. The stranded copper conductors are tinned, and the ends already have a dab of solder. I'll be using heat shrink crimp connectors, so trimmed off the soldered tips. The PVC sheathing on this wire is smooth and I was able to easily pull it through a conduit to replace an old wire with just some electrical tape joining the ends. Tested with a light drawing 2 amps, and only detected a .3V voltage drop across the entire 50 foot coil. Sold as 12V low voltage wire, but rated for 300V. I like that this wire is rated for direct burial and waterproof, so long as it remains undamaged. It's easy enough to slide this through some conduit or at least sections of old garden hose or something to make it more durable and resist chafing. The PVC sleeve is somewhat loose and the individual wires can be removed from short sections fairly easily. Not very flexible, but easy enough to bend. The price point is typical for similar products, but I see a 20% discount is currently offered, making it a good bargain for a good product.",
      "B0CH861BMS ★★★★★ <b>Looks like great, durable wire</b> The outer coating on this stuff is super thick. The diameter is right at about 6mm. It looks like it will be extremely durable. It does make the wire bigger overall, though, if that matters for the particular use case. For me it doesn't, so I'm happy with it. I must admit I had quite a lot of trouble stripping this wire at first. Traditional strippers that have a sharpened hole certainly wouldn't work due to the two conductors inside occupying more space in one direction than another. I tried cutting them carefully with a sharp knife and ended up cutting into the inner conductors despite my care. I think the trick is to either have some nice wire strippers that have the two heads that pull apart, which mostly work, or using a sharp knife in concert with bending the wire away from the cut so it pulls itself apart when split. A dismantling tool also works fairly well, though is harder to keep as pretty. The self-adjusting stripper is the easiest way and makes a decently clean separation, but is a bit fickle at the size and stretchiness of the outer layer. I was slightly confused that the wire fit inside an 18awg ferrule, thinking they may have undersized the wire, but I tried another 16 gauge wire I had in hand and it did too. So no worries, I think. Anyway, this is nice stuff that I'd have no problem recommending.",
      "B0CK4WHWBY ★★★★★ <b>Quality 18-2 wire that's water, oil, UV resistant</b> Slightly more expensive than simple 18-2 outdoor lamp wire but well worth it = 5 stars. I am using this 18-2 wire as speaker cable in a jeep where the wire travels outside the car. Because it is water and oil resistant, the jacket should last a very long time against whatever gets flung onto it. Because it essentially has two jackets, it is more resistant to abuse, the extra padding slightly helps prevent radio interference in and out as well. What I like ~ • Feels like quality wire ~ the jacket feels like higher end microphone cabling. It's also fairly flexible and easy to shape. • Looks like quality wire ~ as advertised, UL is clearly marked and the jacketing appears to be uniform in thickness around the inner insulators. Copper is tinned and spun neatly. What I do not like ~ nothing to note here.",
      "B0CK4WHWBY ★★★★★ <b>Quality 3-Conductor Wire For DC Current Projects!</b> If you are a builder of DC current projects this 3-conductor pvc jacketed wire will come in handy! The wire specs are 18 Gauge tinned copper stranded conductors for superior resistance to corrosion x 30’ Long, and it’s safe for underground use, nice!

      "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>Double-Insulated Underground Wire</b> I got the 164-feet of 12.5 gauge wire. I have a large fenced veggie garden and orchard, with wire fencing and electrified wire strands. I’m in a wilderness area, with a lot of large and small animals that would like to breach that fence, so the electrical system is super important. I’m setting up another wired enclosure around the separate garage, and I need to run a live wire underground to it. This flexible, reasonably heavy-duty double-insulated wire is ideal. It’s made for “direct burial.” It has to be quality, because if there’s a breach, the current will short out and be lost. It comes on a decent spool that makes paying it out relatively easy.",
      "B09V56LTY5 ★★★★☆ <b>Good for repairing outdoor marker light cables, robust insulation, pure copper wire - not tinned</b> We have an extensive series of outdoor stairs and boardwalks that are lighted by LED marker lights every ten feet. The lights are powered by a low voltage cable under the walkways. Last Winter a mother fox made a temporary den for her cubs under one of the boardwalks. In the Spring we discovered that several of the marker lights wouldn't light up due to power cables that were chewed through by sharp little teeth. The foxes have moved on but we were faced with repairing the broken cable. That's why I got this cable. It's perfect for low voltage outdoor use. The outside jacket is thick and robust. It took a bit of careful cutting to strip it off without damaging the inside conductor wires. Once off, I noticed this isn't just a standard single channel insulator jacket. It actually has two channels -- one for each of the conductors. (See photo.) That's makes for very tightly insulated conductors that should provide enhanced protection in underground or very wet environments. When I stripped the two conductors, I noticed they are not tinned as stated in the product description. This may or may not be an issue for you. Tinned copper cable is easier to solder and also minimizes corrosion for non-soldered joints. I removed a star from an otherwise five star review due to this. Summary Comments If you don't need tinned copper cable for low voltage outdoor applications, this is a good choice. The insulation is robust and should hold up well in underground or wet environments. You get pure copper conductors that provide efficient electrical conductivity.",
      "B09V56LTY5 ★★★★★ <b>Good copper electrical wire in 16AWG</b> The wire is as described and perform well. Two (red and black) wires with its own PVC insulation and there is a PVC outer jacket covering both. Wires are copper (NOT lower conductivity grade Copper Clad Aluminium). I made an actual count and there are exactly 27 strands. The outer jacket can be stripped off with wire stripper at 14AWG, which really indicate the wire is even slightly bigger than 16AWG. Nice wire, with good conductivity and well made. Excellent for extension or versatile use.",

I do lots of wiring projects here in the countryside, and it’s great to have a coil like this at hand. Most recently, I used this to wire electronics on my front power gate, and will use it to rewire my boat as well. There’s a tough PVC sleeve, and then the wires themselves are color coded, which is essential. Great.",
      "B0CH861BMS ★★★★★ <b>Good for cars and boats!</b> Wow! Great looking wire! Tinned copper wire is the way to go! It has the preferred characteristics of copper (low resistance and flexibility) with the corrosion resistance of tin. I have had to throw away pure copper wire from the 70s since it develops green oxidation and is a pain to clean but have yet to have to clean tinned copper before crimping or soldering. This wire has fewer strands that are larger and a heavy PVC outer coating, compared to the small strand silicon coated wire I use for RC helicopters. This makes it stiffer, easier to route, and tougher. I wouldn't hesitate to walk on this wire or pull it across metal edges that would cut silicon insulation. The larger strands are also better for crimping since smaller strands are more likely to break at the crimp. The only negative is the large outer diameter will limit the number of runs you can have in small spaces. Excellent wire! Recommended!",
      "B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ <b>Great for the primary run from low voltage LED power supplies</b> This is a quality cable, UL rated, with a heavy protective outer layer of insulation. I used it to run my low voltage LED power supply to junction boxes that then go to the individual lights or light strings. Due to the heavy insulation jacket it is ideal for the primary run, and not for a string of connections, since the jacket not only protects the wires, but also makes it more difficult to connect than standard parallel low voltage wiring with a single layer of insulation over each wire. This wire is good for durability and where it will not be changed often, while the less expensive and less protected wiring is good where you use pierce type connections or grease filled twist connectors and run it around your yard.",
      "B0CQP4KJM4 ★★★★★ <b>Good project wire.</b> This 16 gauge four conductor wire is 16 feet long wrapped in white PVC. The inner four wires are tinned cooper stranded.

The transparent inner insulator was not measured as it is well bonded to the outer black insulation. The transparent layer is much thinner than is shown in the listing pictures. Still, this is about the most robust direct burial high voltage fencing wire I've used. I'd have no concern burying this in rocky soil. The reel comes with clear plastic wrap to hold the wire snug. However, they didn't use enough of it so the outer two layers of wire unwound like a clock spring. Recommendation overall - excellent deal!",
      "B0CK4WHWBY ★★★★★ <b>Easy to Work With. Quality Meets Expectations.</b> I've used a lot of wire and this one feels good quality. I found it easy to work with as well (but I also have excellent tools in my kit to work with.) The quality definitely meets my standards. Since I just started using this wire, I should say that I'm not sure how it'll hold up over the long-term. But upon just getting started with it, so far so good. Here are the factors about this wire that were most important to me. The wire is UL2464 compliant, meaning it meets strict quality standards. 9 strands of 0.254mm tinned copper wire, so it's got great conductivity. PVC Jacket seems thick and sturdy - making it durable. It also claims to be flame resistant, though I haven't personally checked that claim. All in all, I'm happy with the wire and feel it was a good choice. I would consider getting it again.",
      "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>Works great for farm use</b> The RiteFENCE Electric Fence Double Insulated Underground Hard Cable is working perfectly for use 'underneath' my 12' and 16' foot double gates that lead to my pasture. For years I have used a system where I disconnect my electric fence by hand to open my gates without getting shocked. I dug a small trench about 6\" deep under a couple of my gates and buried the RiteFENCE, and left each end protrude out of the ground about two feet to connect to one of the lower existing fence wires so as not to disconnect the continuous circuit at any time when opening gates now. I chose the 6\" depth to bury the heavily insulated RiteFENCE since in addition to moving livestock through the gates, I also drive vehicles and farm implements through the gates as well. The RiteFENCE is very sturdy and rigid, and the 12-½ gauge took some time to straighten out to fit flat and neatly into the trenches I dug and placed the wire into, but this is a definite plus for electric fence wire to be used on a farm or ranch. The RiteFENCE doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and has a thick outer coating with the inner wire apparently coated as well for the 'double insulation' aspect. When installing, I also cut back a couple of inches of the RiteFENCE on each end and used a heavy duty crimp connection to the barb wire fencing I use. Once crimped, I neatly wrapped the connections with quality electrical tape to seal from the elements. The RiteFENCE is going to be ideal for many other underground connection needs I have around the farm. I would highly recommend any farmers and ranchers who run electric fence to give the RiteFENCE a try if you want to eliminate the risk of a nasty shock, especially with the higher powered fence chargers. The price point seems very fair and in fact is actually a little cheaper than what I saw at my local farm supply store. Highly recommend!",

I required a fully insulated wire package that didn't need to be placed in a conduit. This wire is perfect for the application. The core wire is copper and each is insulated in 1mm of sheeting and both strands are further covered in another 1mm+ thick outer layer. This creates a robust self-contained unit, that is not easily pinched ,buckled or abraded.",

The two layers of insulation strip cleanly and easily, making connections to the galvanized steel inner conductor simple. With this larger roll (100m/328 feet) I can extend the garden fence to include some nearby fruit trees as well. I also plan to use it to add to the grounding system for better shock effectiveness. One thing that should be noted is that the listing describes this product as: “16 Gauge Class 3 Galvanized Steel wire, Insulation Rated Up to15,000 Volts. Resistance 56 ohms/mile”. This 16-gauge product is actually 161 Ohms/mile; it is the larger 12-1/2-gauge conductor that is only 56 Ohms/mile. Other than that, this seems like a good product and a good value for the money.",

The roll of wire comes with plenty of short heat shrink tubing pieces, several wire ties, and two reusable hook-and-loop wire wraps. The insulation on each wire is thick and durable PVC and the outer jacket is flexible, yet durable PVC material. The wires inside the outer jacket are not bonded to the outer jacket, instead, they float inside the outer jacket. This allows the user to easily pull the wires out of the jacket as needed. This wire would make an excellent automotive or marine wire harness for multiple lights that require separate control. Overall, this 16/6 wire seems to be great wire with a durable outer protective jacket that makes it ideal for automotive and marine wire harnesses or for other low-voltage applications.",

So, it is basically as advertised ... but still, not exactly what I wanted. For bodging and wrapping electronic projects, it is better to have thinner insulation ... the jacket on this wire is exceptionally thick for the gauge. It is impossible to fish this through PCB journals without drilling them out. Still, it will be useful, as wraps nicely around posts, and seems a good value.

The wire gauge size seems accurate and fits snuggly in my breadboards. Only thing I noticed is the insulation coating is a little thicker than I expected. I'm using it to do Arduino prototyping and often or run wires underneath things plugged into the breadboard and the extra thickness of the insulation tends to take up valuable space so I can't get as many wires as I used to. It's a small challenge and I may look around it other brands but overall it's a good value for the variety of colors and the fact that the wire looks like it's tinned copper. I should mention that if you're going to solder this, the insulation does look like PVC and it will melt fairly quickly, so do your soldering quickly and at lower temperatures. I use a 384° solder on a temperature adjustable weller and I haven't had an issue.

The overall cable is nice and flexible, and the individual wires are also flexible, so there are no issues with working with the wires and getting them where you want them to go. I ordered this cable to finish up an LED lighting project and it worked exactly as I needed it to. I wish I could write more about this cable, but it is just good cable. I am very happy with this cable.",

Upon receipt, I did a continuity test on each colored strand and they passed. The PVC jacket insulation material is quite thick and it cuts cleanly using a sharp blade or a snipping tool. The supplier claims it is resistant to sunlight and chemicals. PVC is normally fairly UV-resistant but it will become damaged with continued direct sun exposure. This wire is suitable for many uses and is labeled for use in LED lighting. It would be useful for many other purposes such as speaker wire. I will use for general electronics as well as an HF-receive antenna (shortwave). It should be good for periods of outdoor use and the stranded copper wire should not break as solid wire does if repeatedly coiled, etc Bottom Line: Good stranded copper wire for many uses..",
      "B0CG1GSW3P ★★★★★ <b>Within Spec and Suitable for Many Applications</b> Measures to 6 gauge, but the spec for stranded 10 is going to be a little bit fatter anyway. The insulation seems to be adequate. This wire has numerous strands that are not 100% copper. In looking at the ends there seems to be some copper in the strands, but a VERY small amount. The red and black conductors are not fused as is often common for this type of wire. If you are looking to connect a two-way radio or some other high-draw device, then routing the wire could be challenging since both black and red are completely separate. Given its diameter and insulation, I suspect that this wire is within spec and suitable for many applications.",
      "B0CG1GSW3P ★★★★★ <b>Quality wire that’s actually copper not just thick insulation</b> Got this wire to do a mod on my fuel pump on my Foxbody mustang. Anytime I see some good wire for a good price I get it. It’s hard to beat 30ft of Red/black 10 gauge wire for this price. This is a good quality wire. A lot of wiring companies will make the insulation really thick and skip out on the copper wire. This wire isn’t that way the insulation is thick enough without it taking the place of the copper wire. This wire is flexible which is what you look for when buying a good quality wire because the cheaper stuff is stiff and hard to bend. So far I’ve used this for my 340 fuel pump on my turbo Foxbody and I’m going to be using it for my electric fan on the foxbody. You need a good quality wire that can hold the load without getting hot or melting. If you do a lot of automotive wiring like me this stuff is a life saver.",

A great feature is that the wires are copper tinned providing the option of sodering connections. Having 8 conductors affords a nice variety of plausible applications. The item appears as described by the seller, although the wire may be a bit shy of a true 18 guage. Accordingly, it would be best to exercise caution as to the amount of current in which you plan to use with this wire. I am pleased with this item and believe you will be as well. Therefore, Dr. T. recommends this product with the caveat that it may not have a true 18 guage capacity.",

This is a good multipurpose wire for many projects like solar power hook ups or other higher current loads that 10 Gauge wire is rated for.",
      "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>Good, Cost-Effective Choice</b> This is a well-constructed cable which I'll be using from my barn to my fence and under my driveway and gates between fences. In addition, I'm going to try electric fencing around some fruit trees and around my garden to try to discourage deer (wish me luck on that one). I will run this cable underground between trees and garden. Before I do all this, i intend to try to push this somewhat-rigid cable temporarily down my septic main and use a cable locater to stake the location. Being an electrician with some high-voltage experience, I think the 15KV insulation claim is realistic, Also, I think the 2 thick layers of PE insulation will be quite tough in standing up to abrasion and the elements. My opinion is that the pricing for this 328' roll can't be beat and I recommend the product.",
      "B0BTDSKT51 ★★★★☆ <b>Works well outer covering is thin</b> This product works well and does the job for installing my landscape lights that we have.

As well the 4 wires in a single run is perfect for wiring up a pair of speakers on a bus with its cable routing panels. Thick insulation and wiring is easy to strip and cut, length of cable included is great, really heavy weight versus traditional wire for speakers. For my special use I like these cable spool best.",

It is 50 feet of 12/2 (12 Gauge Wire/2 Conductor) low voltage landscape wire. It has a thick PVC insulation cover over copper wire. The insulation is sunlight resistant and works for direct burial. It is exactly what I need for my landscape lighting. I am adding lights to my existing professional installed low voltage landscape lights. 12/2 wire was originally installed, so I am using matching wire. I ran an outdoor pendant light up a tree using this wire. It was easy to work with. Some of the wire got buried and the rest will get plenty of sun exposure. The light works great. Great low voltage wire for landscape lighting.",
      "B0CWNBZ164 ★★★★★ <b>Just the thing for so many differnent projects</b> My wire came rolled on a 6\" or so diameter plastic spool, in a resealable bag (appears to be a static bag). What a deal... just perfect to both use and store, sits flat and doesn't take up much room and stacks well. Great start... The outside insulation jacket is a very thick PVC material, it wasn't real easy to cut so it shouldn't nick easily (think of a errant nick from using a wire staple). Even though it's a thick jacket, it's super pliable. The inside wire insulation both cuts and strips more easily than the outside and is easy to work with. I only hesitate saying a joy, because it sounds to corny... There's about a million different uses and projects that this wire would be perfect for, you'll certainly run out of wire before you run out of projects. It is NOT house wiring or electrical supply to anything... it's very small, 22 gauge is tiny.. In a house, it would be doorbell or maybe 'ring' style wiring (or alarm sensors), garage door buttons & sensors, not for lights or outlets, extension cords, etc.. Most people probably realize that - but I'm saying it here, just in case... Save yourself a trip to the local hardware and just keep a roll of this on hand. You'll be so happy to have it at the ready when needed.",

The conductor insulation is sufficiently thick to provide decent protection, without being difficult to bend. The PVC jacket containing the bundle is also decently thick, while being nice and flexible. It has a glossy finish which looks nice, but does attract dirt/contaminates. All this combined makes this six-core bundle rather easy to run for the overall size. My kit did not include the heat shrink or zip ties as advertised, but I'm not bothered by this since I have my own high quality supplies to use in place of these items.",

Fine gauge strands</b> I measured the wire length and indeed it measured 10 feet each for the black and red wire. Wire is marked \"14 AWG 300 C\", and I noticed the silicone insulation is a little tougher than other silicone wire I've bought, which is a good thing. Silicone insulation is not very abrasion resistant, so help in that area is appreciated. As you can see, the strands used are very fine. Nice wire - recommended!",
      "B0CNXJ9H6Q ★★★★★ <b>Great for small projects</b> I ordered this wire for one of my daughter's science experiments. The ten foot roll is the perfect size for small projects. This wire comes neatly wound on a plastic spool and shrink wrapped to avoid oxidation. It has a high quality PVC shield, which isn't very easy to strip. It provides plenty of insulation. The thick shielding causes this wire to spring off the spool, so as soon as I opened it, I had to rewind it and secure it with a rubber band. The wire is properly marked and is UL listed. This seems to be high quality wire, but I have limited experience with electric wiring. Fortunately, this is the perfect size for testing, and it is available in other length options, so it's worth experimenting before committing to a larger project.",
      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★★★ <b>Actually heat resistant, at least short-term, and insulation is good thickness and softness</b> With this being sold as silicone insulation, I tested it for heat resistance by holding the end directly in a gas stove flame for one minute. After a minute of flame contact, the insulation was chalky and white over about 1/2 inch, and the 1/4 inch that was directly in the flame was significantly weakened. The bottom part that got the most heat was easily peeled off with a fingernail. The top part lost about half its thickness, becoming the white chalky powder that didn’t stay attached, but the lower layers were still functional insulation. The insulation that was right next to the flame lost its gloss but stayed flexible and fairly tough. The portion of insulation just 1/2 inch away from the flame was completely unaffected despite probably reaching a few hundred degrees F in temperature. Seriously impressive results for generic wire, and this appears to be actual silicone insulation. The usual concern I have with off-brand wire like this is that the insulation will have one of a few common problems: the most common is being excessively thick to give the impression that the wire is lower-gauge than it actually is, and then it’s made very soft to keep it flexible so it ends up weak and vulnerable to damage. The other common problem I’ve found is thin, hard insulation and coarse wire stranding so the wire has too much “memory,” making it a pain to work with while still not offering much toughness. This wiring is in the middle, with a good moderate insulation thickness, fine strands, and what seems to be a good balance of flexibility and protection from the insulation. It’s still on the soft side, but feels like it will be fairly tough. It still definitely feels like cheap wire to me, but it’s a good price and it should get the job done.",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Quality wire</b> Love the box with prepunched holes that makes it easy to dispense the wire without pulling the spools out. The included zipties are also a nice touch.

I needed about 40 foot of 8 conductor wire for my thermostat and originally looked at my local building supply center. The Store only sold 250 foot. I found this a little closer to my needs and budget. The PVC insulation was a little thicker but it works for my needs just as well. Overall decent value for the money.",
      "B0CG1GSW3P ★★★★★ <b>10/10 Wire</b> Great wire. The protective coating is very thick and should be 100% waterproof and UV proof for the lifetime of the wire.

      "B0CLBHT8YX ★★★★☆ <b>Quality wires. Wrapping is a little sloppy.</b> The wire itself is good quality. Consistent color and thickness of insulation across each roll. Insulation cuts cleanly and easily. Wire solders securely and has low resistance in use. My only complaint is that the small spools are wound a little sloppily. It wouldn't matter that much except that increases the possibility of tangles. The box makes dispensing small amounts easy.",
      "B07TMDW6X5 ★★★★☆ <b>It's cable, it's thick, it's rather expensive</b> Nothing much to say, it's stranded cable, reasonably flexible. Solders well, insulation is on the thicker side (4.5 mm dia), a bit overpriced.",
      "B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ <b>Good Wire for Higher Current Applications</b> I will start off by saying that the outer black insulation is very thick and solidly encapsulated around the two inner wires, as shown in the photos. Wire is definitely copper, the real deal. It took to solder nicely. I LOVE that the insulation for both white and black wires is VERY heat resistant. You can tell from the closeup that the insulation on either wire didn't melt at all after tinning the wires. This is a good choice for 14AWG pure copper wire for powering lights or DC equipment, maybe radio equipment with some Anderson power connectors crimped on the ends. Gets my nod for quality."

      "B0793MRX91 ★☆☆☆☆ <b>The insulation is a danger, wire is unknown</b> The insulation on this wire expands and moves- has no markings of any kind. This is not acceptable or safe, electrical fires can result!!! Not sure about the conductor wire; it’s not copper and seems to be coated aluminum. Doesn’t accept solder, either. This product is crap. I’ll take that back; crap can decompose into something useful. This wire is useful maybe for an art project but has no place in the application of transporting electrons!",
      "B000BPC14C ★★★★☆ <b>Electro-galvanized</b> I did a review on the 20 gauge wire from this company and what I wrote applies here as well. \"The wire is good and the container/dispenser is a good way to stay organized. The amount of galvanizing on this wire is not that much and I am curious to see how long before it begins to rust. It would have been nice if it had been drawn and then hot-dipped galvanized but I guess stuff like that is in the past. I will update in about 6 months to let you know if there is any rusting.\"",

      "B0CV7XSN9H ★★★★★ <b>Far superior to what I found in the walls...</b> I've bought and used a lot of wire over the years-- enough to have found the experience peculiarly reminiscent of my old online dating days. What I see and read online isn't always what I get. (In this case, however, things are even better in person than in the pics.) ; ) PROS: - Thicker-than-usual copper strands - Tinned (coated with an oxidation-resistant metal to protect the copper) - Banana plugs grip tight on the copper strands - not going to rip out - Stiff-yet-flexible (unlike solid core) CONS: - Does not include B&W speakers. But to be fair, that would be a really bad business decision. * NOTE: - This is unshielded speaker wire.

I like this wire, I know it will be useful in the future. I plan to use it to wire some outdoor lights in the sun room at my park model when it opens up again for the season. Upon inspection of the wire it appears brand new and there are no signs of damage anywhere on the wire. I’m not sure why this wire is tinned because generally you would utilize screw on caps in order to secure the junction between two wires in a home rough in environment.

      "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ <b>Quality wire in a durable jacket</b> I acquired this cable to wire some repair some existing lights and add supplemental warning lights on my tractor. Wire for rear tractor lighting needs to be run along the underside where brush, sticks, briars claw away at it constantly. More than once, I have had wiring damaged or destroyed. I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications. I really like this wire, and I look forward to using it to upgrade my tractor warning lights in preparation for spring. It would be equally suitable for use on a mowers or trailers as well. I think this product will provide adequate protection for wiring in a tough environment for a long time. In fact, with good end connections, I am hopeful that it will last as long as the equipment."

The outer casing is more or less a sleeve and not form fit tight. Kind of like indoor romax house wiring only a little thicker. Getting a clean straight installation will be difficult without using multipal hangers. Probably a good thing to do would be wait for a hot sunny day to stretch it out and let lay in the sun for a while. I will be using this in a marine environment so, it coming pre-tinned is good, as I will be soldering all my lugs on. My wire gauge shows that it is actual 16 gauge wire. It will do the job I want it to. I will just have to work with it a little more to get a nice, clean looking install.",
      "B079NXCN6B ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Started peeling off in less than a day</b> It doesn't stay stuck to my wall. I followed the instructions and watched the video beforehand. I wiped the wall with a damp microfiber to remove any dust and let it dry. I then applied the Ghost Wire starting at one end, peeling about a foot of the backing off at a time, smoothing it and rubbing it to the wall. Working the wrinkles out as I went along. Within one day, both ends of the run had about 6 inches peeling off the wall. Three days later, and both ends are now peeled off about 2 feet. Every morning I've tried to rub it back to the wall. My walls do have a very slight orange peel texture. Perhaps on a smooth finish the Ghost Wire would adhere better. I have not attempted to paint over it yet (and likely won't since it doesn't stay on). The total length of my application was 11.5 feet. Beyond the issue of it not remaining adhered, there were a couple other issues as well. First, there's about 1/8 of clear adhesive which is not covered by the white surface material running down the entire length of the roll. This is very visible (and sticky feeling). I was hoping that I could spray some wall texture over it since paint will likely not cover it correctly. I also snapped off my exposed ends when attaching the end connectors. Since the copper is very thin, any etching done with a razor blade to cleanly expose the copper strips weakens it to the point that any flex will shear it off. I had to peel back and use scissors, leaving a small flap rather than a nice clean transition. My Ghost Wire also was quite wrinkled from being rolled up. The manufacturer states that it's a known issue and recommends a heatgun/hairdryer to remedy so I expected that going in I liked the idea of this product. If it would have stayed on the wall, it would have been great. Even with the problems I had, I could see this working well if run under a carpet. I'm contemplating using a router to notch a shallow channel in the drywall and then just mud over the inserted wire. [update] A week later, and it's completely peeled off. Not an inch is left stuck to the wall. It's just hanging between the two connector blocks that are screwed in.",

It wasn’t planned initially so I had to find something that would run under a rug pad and rug. I searched and found Ghost Wire! Is it a bit pricey? Yes. Is it freaking worth it? Hell yeah! It’s super flat, the copper is a nice thickness and it’s STICKY! If your surface is not clean, it won’t stick well. Have a clean surface? It’s not coming off without some damage - KEEP THIS IN MIND!! Used this along a painted concrete floor. Worked exceptionally. Easy to install and put in place. I now have surround sound and you can’t even tell it’s there! You must use the connecting block! It’s designed to connect the flat wire to your speaker wire. Don’t cheap out. Highly recommend this if you need super flat, hidden wire.",

This 5-wire is cased in a black sleeve casing that is durable and fits perfectly into a 1/2\" seal tight fitting. I would have given it a 5 star if the wires casing was molded around the inner wires but it is just a casing that is slid over the wires. With that said, I still think that this will be a robust solution and will last many years. The kit also comes with shrink tubes for the wire connections. I did not use these for terminating the wires though.",

      "B079NXCN6B ★★☆☆☆ <b>imperfect solution</b> Seemed like a good fit for my situation. I really didn't want to run wire through so many walls. After cleaning the walls, installing and painting it looked reasonably good. Sure there was a visible bump, but with pictures and knick-knacks breaking up the visual space it wasn't noticeable unless you were looking for it. Over time (several months to a few years), however, the wire just started peeling off. It took a lot of time to be sure, but especially on exterior walls (which get colder than the ambient temperature of the room) they came completely detached in sections. Still using them while I look for a better solution, but it looks ridiculous on the exterior wall where it's almost completely fallen off.",
      "B079NXCN6B ★★★★☆ <b>Almost invisible</b> We ran this wire on the ceiling for 2 runs of less than 5' and also for a run from a LED wall sconce to the wall switch. It worked out great.

We live in Mexico and it is not against code, but if you are concerned I would check with your local code. In addition this is an adult houshold (no kids), so we are aware of what his hooked up, and treat it accordingly. I know Sewell says not for 120v, but I am sure that is a safety statement so they do not get sued if something ever was to go wrong or was not installed properly. If I was to do it again I would sand the wall and ceiling where the wire will lay down to give a completely flat finish. By doing this I believe it would be completely invisible after painting as the thickness of the wire would not ahow up !nd allow a perfectly transparent finish. My experience is if you lay it on top of the texture it will be visible from some angles, but mostly it is almost invisible.",

Has 4 color-coded wires which makes it so easy to figure out which one, especially when wiring behind walls or panels. Very conductive wires, and does its job for it's purpose! Long enough for any projects too! It came in a well-packaged protective, sealed bag. Very easy to use, assemble, flexible enough but doesn't break easily!

      "B079NXCN6B ★★★★★ <b>Choose Your Location Well</b> Choosing a strategic location for the Ghost Wire can affect its visibility. I tried to butt it against corners, door frames, and base board to minimize its visibility. Likes: It gets the job done without needing to drill through walls, floors, or ceilings and then \"fish\" for speaker wire behind the wall or between joists; After working out the first connection to a terminal, the rest of them were easy to do; When I connected my speakers, it worked the first time and I have had no problems with the sound; Without doing any feathering or texturing, It took a coat of paint and matched the existing wall color perfectly (I have to point out the tape to people in order to get them to notice that it's there.) Dislikes: Although we had freshly painted walls (professionally done), the adhesive likes to come loose in a few places even though it was thoroughly pressed against the wall upon installation (It's not the worst thing in the world but I don't like to see any gap between the tape and the wall); I needed a little more Ghost Wire than was on the 100' reel so I ordered another 25' which is not on a reel and had a lot more bubbling (didn't easily lay flat on the wall); At over a buck per linear foot, it is a bit too pricey to use in every room; the folded corners do have a tendency to stand out, literally. NOTE: You still need speaker wire to run from the terminals to the speakers (I have wall mounted speakers and use about 1 foot of regular wire per speaker) and from the terminals on the other end to the amplifier or other source. If you order banana plugs (either solid or braided wire) with the terminals, the plugs do not fit into the holes in the terminals and you have to use bare wire. If they would manufacture the terminals with slightly larger holes, it would be excellent. Maybe someday they will."

While the printed information on the wire is the same other than date and time I would not expect different lots to be so drastically different for \"direct burial\" rated wire.

      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Great quality automotive & marine wire</b> This is perfect wire for automotive use, including campers and marine applications. The conductors are fine stranded, tinned copper, which is a thin protective coating on the copper to keep it from corroding in harsh environments such as ocean areas, or auto applications where winter road salting can cause problems. Despite what other reviewers have said, this is indeed copper wire, but the “tinning” process makes the wire appear silver unless you look at the cut end. It is typically used with crimp connectors in most applications. There is no indication that this wire is UL listed, so I would not use it for home-wiring applications or any 120 volt (or higher) AC current. The silicone insulation and fine stranding make this wire very flexible, so perfect for sharp turns and pulling through tight locations like behind the dash. The 14 gauge that I used is good for any circuits of up to 10 amps unless they are longer than 25 feet or so. Remember to calculate for both positive and negative lengths, and whether you can afford any voltage drop in your circuit. Circuits for an automotive refrigerator or fog lamps, which have extended use times for example, are different than a circuit for a horn, which is only used for a couple seconds at a time. This seems to be a very good quality and well manufactured wire, and is available in a wide variety of gauges, both red and black.",

Very flexible and finely stranded, so it is easy to pull and route where needed and various colors for identification according to your needs. 14 gauge is typical for 15 amps or less in relatively short distances like a vehicle, and the silicone insulation is both durable and well suited for applications where moisture, oils or dirt may be encountered. Also comes with an assortment of wire ties. Note that this is not manufactured or or suitable for use in house wiring, nor is it UL Listed. Overall, a nice selection of quality wire at a reasonable price.",

The exterior coating is thick and it has an additional plastic layer + a plastic separator. It’s “exterior” for about 3” of wire on this run but I’m also going to run it direct-burial to my generator and I have confidence it will hold up. It fit standard Cat6 ends (barely). Standard tension guards also fit on the wire but once again, barely. My gripe is that there are defects on the individual wire sheathing (mostly green stripe). It’s bubbled and extra thick in places so if you accidentally find a piece like that, you lose 1 inch to 1 foot recutting the wire until you find an inch or two that will push into the connector. I can’t find this wire in black locally so I’m not complaining too much but be aware it’s frustrating and probably not what you want for your 10Gbps network.

      "B0CN316VHN ★★★★★ <b>High Quality Wire at a Great Value</b> I go through tons of low voltage wire each year between various outdoor lighting projects, christmas lights, landscaping lights, etc. This wire is fantastic and the best part about it, it's direct burial so I don't need to run it through a PVC tube! The shielding is of high quality, was easy to splice and easy to run. I haven't experienced any defects in the wire and everything has worked out as expected.",
      "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ <b>Durable, very nice wiring harness.</b> I am updating an emergency vehicle and am using this to run the equipment. It’s easy to work with and good thick wire. Came with nice little Velcro straps for keeping the roll together. The finish is nice on the outer casing. Nice gloss black. Excellent product. In fact I bought another 50 foot roll. And the prices for this is extremely good. Glad I found this wiring.",
      "B0BGMVRR6G ★★★★☆ <b>Not industry standard - not necessarily bad</b> So..... \"Industry standard\" says 8/2 has 3 cables and 8/3 has 4 etc.... HOWEVER, that system is kinda stupid and this labelling system is a lot more intuitive. (8/3 is 8 gauge with 3 cables???? WOW) THAT BEING SAID. I'm very excited to see how they intend to wire 600v with this. Maybe I'm ignorant but that seems a bit misleading mixed with the 8/3 title. Ignoring all of that - the coating on this cord is INDUSTRIAL and the finer weave cable makes it more flexible than most 8/2 wire. I ended up deciding to make this into a 220 extension cord for a welder instead of having it as a fixed circuit.",

The Higoom wire is particularly easy to handle, far easier to use in tight spaces than stiffer wires, and the tinned copper core makes it very simple to solder, too. Having six colors to choose from to match the color of a splice or repair in car or trailer wiring, along with the included short lengths of shrink tubing, means that 12-volt system repairs can be nearly invisible. The perforated dispensing box is a nice touch for anyone who does such work at a single work station, though I don't think I'll be using that feature. A really handy set of 16-gauge wire, and one that should last me a long time.",
      "B079NXCN6B ★★★★☆ <b>Works well and painted Ghost Wire is not conspicuous</b> I found installation tricky. Since they are wide and flat, if you start to veer off your intended line, it is difficult to make the course correction without getting a bubble in the tape. Overall the installation looks good and after painting Ghost Wire to match the wall it is not too conspicuous even with the couple of bubbles I introduced with my installation.",
      "B079NXCN6B ★★★★★ <b>Choose Your Location Well</b> Choosing a strategic location for the Ghost Wire can affect its visibility. I tried to butt it against corners, door frames, and base board to minimize its visibility. Likes: It gets the job done without needing to drill through walls, floors, or ceilings and then \"fish\" for speaker wire behind the wall or between joists; After working out the first connection to a terminal, the rest of them were easy to do; When I connected my speakers, it worked the first time and I have had no problems with the sound; Without doing any feathering or texturing, It took a coat of paint and matched the existing wall color perfectly (I have to point out the tape to people in order to get them to notice that it's there.) Dislikes: Although we had freshly painted walls (professionally done), the adhesive likes to come loose in a few places even though it was thoroughly pressed against the wall upon installation (It's not the worst thing in the world but I don't like to see any gap between the tape and the wall); I needed a little more Ghost Wire than was on the 100' reel so I ordered another 25' which is not on a reel and had a lot more bubbling (didn't easily lay flat on the wall); At over a buck per linear foot, it is a bit too pricey to use in every room; the folded corners do have a tendency to stand out, literally. NOTE: You still need speaker wire to run from the terminals to the speakers (I have wall mounted speakers and use about 1 foot of regular wire per speaker) and from the terminals on the other end to the amplifier or other source. If you order banana plugs (either solid or braided wire) with the terminals, the plugs do not fit into the holes in the terminals and you have to use bare wire. If they would manufacture the terminals with slightly larger holes, it would be excellent. Maybe someday they will.",

But this wire that I got (8 gauge it says) does not look anything like the wire that is used throughout the electrical work of the stove/oven. The stove/oven wire appears to be about one third the diameter of the ordered wire in question. It has a hard, heat resistant , thin coating whereas the wire that was sent to me is covered in soft silicone, the kind you might use to make a mouthpiece out of. Apparently the wire I ordered is used to enhance the volume of the crappy music people play these days."

      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>A Comprehensive Starter Set for Electronics Enthusiasts</b> The 18 Gauge Wire Kit offers an excellent starting point for anyone delving into the realm of electronics, whether as a hobbyist or a budding professional. This kit is particularly appealing for its thoughtful compilation of essential wiring needs, presented in a user-friendly package. Variety and Quality: One of the standout features of this kit is the variety it offers—eight colors of 18 gauge silicone wire, each extending to 23 feet (7 meters). While the length of each spool might not cater to extensive projects, the assortment allows for ample experimentation and small-scale builds. The choice of silicone for the wire sheathing is a commendable one, providing a durable, heat-resistant covering that forgives the occasional soldering mishap, making it an ideal selection for beginners. Additionally, silicone's chemical resistance and flexibility are qualities that veteran electronics enthusiasts will appreciate. Accessories and Utility: The inclusion of color-coordinated heat shrink tubing and zip ties adds a layer of organization and professionalism to projects, enhancing the overall utility of the kit. While the wire stripper may not impress seasoned users, it's a valuable addition for those just starting, offering an all-in-one solution to basic wiring needs. Packaging and Design: The kit's packaging is notably well-conceived, featuring a box with holes for each wire spool, facilitating easy access and storage. This system helps maintain a clean and organized workspace, a boon for any project. However, the opportunity for improvement lies in the visibility of the remaining wire on each spool; a clear plastic window on the box would have perfectly rounded out the design by allowing users to gauge their wire stock at a glance. Conclusion: In summary, the 18 Gauge Wire Kit earns a solid five-star rating not through groundbreaking innovation but through the thoughtful assembly of high-quality components tailored to meet the needs of both novice and experienced electronics enthusiasts. It stands out as a comprehensive and practical kit, perfect for anyone looking to embark on or expand their electronics projects with a reliable selection of wires and tools at their disposal.",
      "B0CRYX1P5T ★★★★★ <b>Alienhomy 14 Gauge Silicone Wire</b> I am working on a small project and this wire suits that need.

I am not sure what else to say about wire in general, other than this is easy to work with.",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★☆ <b>individually tinned strands !</b> It appears that each and every strand of this wire is actually tinned, not just simply ran through a tinning process as a bundle of wire. What I mean to say is these strands look to have been tinned before they were twisted together at the factory. Much better process than what the description portrays. Each wire comes on it's own individual plastic reel, but they are not labeled. The actual wire sheathing IS labeled with the wires size and capacity. Speaking of the wire sheathing, it is very SOFT, leading to a wire that's very flexible but at the cost of abrasion resistance. You can easily strip the sheathing from the wire with your finger nails. The box of 6 colors I ordered came with a small number of small colored zip ties that correspond to each color of wire in the box, a very nice touch.",
      "B0BXKLS2T4 ★★★★★ <b>Actual real copper wire, unlike many other brands, and exactly as advertised. Very pleased.</b> I've previously ordered silicone sheathed wire from suppliers like BNTechGo and others which advertise as \"stranded copper wire\", but are no such thing. They might have a single strand of copper in each wire, and the rest be aluminum, but they are certainly not predominantly copper. The wire strands look and feel nothing like solid copper. Enter Shonsin brand, who I only recently discovered. I ordered this 10AWG cable hoping that for once it might be what was actually advertised, and for once I was pleasantly surprised ! Real solid copper strands, great flexibility, wire gauge to specification, nice flexible silicone sheath that doesn't shrink back when soldering or using heatshrink with a heatgun. Exactly what it should be. The outer diameter of the 10AWG wire was a little larger than ideal for part of my project (my fault for not checking, since it's EXACTLY as they list in their description and sizing/gauge table), and since for that specific use I can get away with 12AWG electrically, I just placed an order for some of their 12AWG cable too. I'm still using the 10AWG cable where the size permits, and will just use the 12AWG for the wires that needs to pass through a small grommet. Hopefully the 12AWG wire is just as good as the 10AWG that I'm already using. Buying shorter lengths is always a little pricey, but this brand seems better quality by far than any of the other brands I've tried (and no more expensive for similar lengths)",

Still bends easily, just thicker than I would like for the outside wire housing. When criping these onto wire terminals, you would almost need to go the next size up due to the thickness of the outer casing. But, it's silicone, so it will crimp with no issues. Nice strand count.",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Assortment of colors makes it easy to keep circuits identifiable</b> This is a set of 6 different colors of tinned copper wire that came on individual spools. This is a great set to have on hand for use with projects that I will need to wire in the future. The colors of the silicone covering is easily visible and identify. I'm have not used wire with thus type of shielding before so I was skeptical. I opened one spool and put it to the test. I knew that tinned wire was easier to solder and offered less resistance and works great for wiring projects. What I didn't know was the silicone covering. After opening the spool I found the covering to be very flexible. It was more maneuverable the other wire I had worked with. It kind of felt like plastic and rubber blended together. It claimed it would withstand high heat and extreme cold. I used my lighter and it took a long time to melt the silicone. I then put the wire in the freezer and after freezing it was still very pliable. This set also came with different colored zip ties so if you need to keep different wires together in a group going to one place these come in handy. This is a great set to keep on hand and I'm sure you will be happy with every project you use them on. They offer so much more then other wire's I've used in the past",

I got the 14awg set and you get many many small strands of wire that add up the a larger core diameter. Would I use this is large applications that require high amps? Probably not honestly, I think I would be a bit more comfortable with a solid core, but if you treat this a step lower on the wire gauge I think that would be a good enough buffer.

I think with this product - go with something that is effective not cheap. Use: Used this for landscaping lights and inserting the 12 AWG wires (connecting pairs) was pretty easy and the connections worked immediately. There is some silicon that oozes out (how else are they supposed to insulate???) and that is fine. I didn't find it to be messy. Water Resistance: To test this truly, I left them out exposed for a couple of months before burying to ensure there is water resistance. Over 12+ days of rain in those 2 months and 3 of them were storms that were windy and rain caused flooding. These things remained good and my landscape lighting worked through and after the rains (and storms!). These work. I would highly recommend these.",

      "B01B6R0OKQ ★★★★★ <b>Works well, looks nice</b> I installed some wireless, solar-powered security cameras on my house and was concerned about the longevity of the USB cable used to connect the solar panels to the cameras. The cords are permanently attached to the panels and cannot be replaced, so I didn't want them exposed constantly to sunlight and weather. So I ordered a 10' roll of the 3/8th\" tubing. I measure out how much cable length I'd need plus a little slack, then I wrapped the excess around one or both of the panel/camera mounts (depending on how much unused cable length there'd be) and wrapped self-bonding silicone tape around the cable to secure/waterproof/protect it. Then I cut an appropriate length of the split tubing and slipped it over the exposed cable between the two, then for some cameras where necessary I cut a smaller piece or two and added them to the small amount of slack I left after the wrapping. Where appropriate I wrapped a small amount of the silicone tape on the ends to keep it in place/further waterproof it. This gives a clean, finished, and professional look. I was impressed with the results so much I've ordered more additional cameras, as well as to help reorganize some computer cable routing.

The outer diameters of this 16 AWG is smaller then the 18 AWG wire, meaning that the heavier gauge (16 AWG) wire has a thinner outer insulation sheath to protect the inner conductors. In the attached photo you can see the 18 gauge cable on the left and the 16 gauge wire on the right. I am disappointed with how thin this cable is and am concerned with it's durability. Also it was more expensive.",
      "B0CK4WHWBY ★★★★★ <b>Pure Copper Wire! It Appears To Be Well Made. I'm Happy!</b> I started working on my project this afternoon, using this wire! This is copper wire, NOT CCA wire (copper coated aluminum). Each lead, red and black have a substantial insulating cover. In addition, both leads/wires are surrounded by another insulation layer that binds everything together. The finished product is round and smooth. This is designed as a direct burial wire. That means it can be used outside, including in the dirt just as it is. However, remember to make all connections perfectly watertight. Part of my project will have the wire exposed to direct sunlight. So I feel certain it will hold up for a long time. Today I made connections using this wire by soldering as well as crimping connectors. I was super pleased with how it performed. Thanks for reading my review! MY PERSONAL COMMENTS: I am an approved Amazon Vine Member. We are provided the opportunity to order (free of charge) many items that are new to the market, or where a seller just wants some additional exposure for their product. We are NOT required to review every item in exchange for using it. I personally only order products that are important to me (items I can use), or items that I have the ability to properly test (I have lots of test equipment) so that I can provide an honest evaluation & review (and not always a 4 or 5 star) based upon my use and testing of the product. Thanks…feel comfortable with any information I provide in a review."

These connectors were already in use and they seemed like a good replacement for when I ran new wiring. They seem like they would protect well against moisture. However, it seems if you pre-strip the wires they do not give a very good connection. I had to cut off a couple of the new ones I installed and reapply because of flaky connections (they cannot be res-used). It's a good job they come in a bag of 50!

Maybe if some terminal-blocks are included, and better less awkward terminal-blocks are developed, and more high-end review shows sonic benegits, than I'd love to consider these in the future.",

Whoever is making these is doing a pretty darn good job. Perfect with perfect fusing perfect flavor promoting and perfect packaging. Thank you very much for the quality you put into your work and the car you put into your work, Wendy’s arrived. I was very pleased as soon as i loaded my first RDA. i’ve been walked around the house abusing those coils as I gathered the rest of my RDAs so I could change them all out with new coils. I’ve been doing this for a long time and I’ve been making Clapton coils for a long time and my friend have done an excellent job thank you for the quality of service you provided. I finally feel like I’m getting my moneys worth, if you are reading this anybody out there do yourself a favor and order a couple tins I ordered two tins and my friends keep taking these so now I have to order a few more and I don’t mind spending the money with this seller thank you and thank you very much you should actually raise your price a little .",

It is definitely a silver color wire and I see no copper at all. Super small strands of wires so it should work well in a project that requires repetitive motion.

The red wire, that was delivered had very faint, pink lettering that was not readable. The black wire was a bit better, but the white lettering was very faint and difficult to read. I can’t vouch for the quality of the wire. I don’t trust a supplier if their pictures are deceptive so I returned the product rather than use it in my project.",

Mine came as a twisted mess that looks unprofessional and not really useable for anything more than auto speaker wire. Looks like just a haphazard cut from a much larger spool. Biggest complaint is it stinks up whatever room it is in. It is potent and I think the manufacturer knew this because it came double bagged. I thought the busted sauce that was in the Amazon box this came together in was what smelled up the box but several days later it's definitely the wire as I can smell it from 8 feet away. The price isn't bad and the copper wire itself seems ok. But the jacket used isn't useable for any code regulated work and it's only marking is the meter length interval. The jacket is also pretty thin and the inside wiring easy twists and came twisted. I wouldn't recommend it for anything beyond audio or LED work where the load is rather light.",

      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★☆ <b>individually tinned strands !</b> It appears that each and every strand of this wire is actually tinned, not just simply ran through a tinning process as a bundle of wire. What I mean to say is these strands look to have been tinned before they were twisted together at the factory. Much better process than what the description portrays. Each wire comes on it's own individual plastic reel, but they are not labeled. The actual wire sheathing IS labeled with the wires size and capacity. Speaking of the wire sheathing, it is very SOFT, leading to a wire that's very flexible but at the cost of abrasion resistance. You can easily strip the sheathing from the wire with your finger nails. The box of 6 colors I ordered came with a small number of small colored zip ties that correspond to each color of wire in the box, a very nice touch.",

I rang the cable out and put colored wire ties on the ends to identify which wire was which. Otherwise, the cable appeared to be of good quality construction.",
      "B0791BL9HN ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Stranded, not Solid. Packaging is unlabeled.</b> The description says \"solid wire\". The outside of the box doesn't say one way or the other. The wire inside is most definitely stranded. I have no idea how a warehouse worker picking it off a shelf is supposed to tell the difference if the box doesn't say. Box also has places to check off what gauge the wire is, and whether it's Silicone or PVC. None of them were checked, so how the manufacturer expects anyone downstream to tell the difference short of opening the box up and stripped the ends of the wires is beyond me.",

That said, I go through batteries every month or 6 weeks and Sensi/ Emerson Support told me that it will help if I had a C-wire. So I purchased and installed this kit this morning. Installation was easy not because of any instructions that came with the product, but from the information that I got from watching the video of a similar product on Youtube. venstar acc0410 add-a-wire installation video One of the reviewers earlier had commented on how much it helped, so I watched that as well and it made the installation a breeze. I wish this product had more documentation than just the wiring diagram which really does not help at all. But then the product is cheap. I will post some follow ups after I complete 6 months to see if it is continuing to function well. In the mean time, I would highly recommend this product.",
      "B09DB9FD5M ★★★☆☆ <b>Smells bad</b> I have used this wire to extend the DC power cable to my security camera. It is 18 gauge copper wire which has no issue at all on may security camera.

I work a lot in AV & live events, and flexible cable like this is awesome. The cable is matte black, like any other normal cable. It feels great in my hand. I love the thinness of the overall cable, while I still trust the outer jacket to hold up well. The specs are clearly labelled on the outer jacket in gray, which makes them useful if you’re looking for the specs. The text blends in otherwise, just like on other cables. Inside the cable, the wires are clearly color-coded for easy identification. This cable ships in a nice coil with Velcro holding it together. It also came with little rubber endcaps, which just shows me that this manufacturer really cares! I highly recommend this cable for your projects.",

Stripping the wire was easy. And I was very pleased that they took the time to do a better job of labeling the wire strands. Too many times manufacturers take the cheap way out and etch the markings into the wire. These are clearly labeled with white type that allows me to be consistent with splicing wires together.",

The flexible jacket material allows for easy twisting and extending as needed. Each conductor is color-coded and enclosed within the white CL2 outer jacket, ensuring safety for use within residential class building walls. I've personally used this wire to replace my car's speaker wiring, and I'm pleased with its performance.

The thick shielding causes this wire to spring off the spool, so as soon as I opened it, I had to rewind it and secure it with a rubber band. The wire is properly marked and is UL listed. This seems to be high quality wire, but I have limited experience with electric wiring. Fortunately, this is the perfect size for testing, and it is available in other length options, so it's worth experimenting before committing to a larger project."

      "B0CRYX1P5T ★★★★★ <b>Exactly as Represented</b> The Alienhomy 12 Gauge Wire 2 Conductor Silicone Wire (25ft Black/Red) is a very nice spool of wire. I've been using very similar wire, and will be using this wire, for primary power on my larger RC planes. The tinning and fine stranding make it easy to solder into various connectors and the flexibility allows this relatively large conductor to be easily tucked away inside my models. The high temperature rating of the insulation ensures that it can handle the heavy, usually short-term amperages that today's advanced RC battery and motor technology demand. I also like to use this wire for various other hobby projects where flexibility is required for making or breaking plug-in connections. It can withstand a lot of flexing due to both the fine stranding and the thick. but soft. silicone insulation. The wire is marked at regular intervals with conductor size and insulation temperature ratings. It is not listed, nor is it appropriate for building wiring. I can recommend this product with confidence."

I bought this product as I only needed about 15' to finish a project - the length was right and was far cheaper then anything else I found online or in store (HD, CTC, HH - Canada). UL rating should be fine in Canada. 1st - this wire is a much lighter wire and insulation then what should be the equivalent 12/2 NMWU. 2nd - the ground wire is molded into the sheathing making it difficult to separate and strip your hot and neutral wires (black, white). 3rd - this wire feels more rigid then 12/2 NMWU, making me wonder about copper content. And finally, this wire is rated for 600 V where 12/2 NMWU is rated for 300 V (as is 14/2 NMD90) - this does NOT change the Amperage rating. - so not sure why. Above is 14/2 NMD90 (top), UF-B 12/2 (middle) and 12/2 NMDU (bottom). I don't know if this is standard in the US, but as noted in previous review, the 25' seems inadequate.",

This wire comes neatly wound on a plastic spool and shrink wrapped to avoid oxidation. It has a high quality PVC shield, which isn't very easy to strip. It provides plenty of insulation. The thick shielding causes this wire to spring off the spool, so as soon as I opened it, I had to rewind it and secure it with a rubber band. The wire is properly marked and is UL listed. This seems to be high quality wire, but I have limited experience with electric wiring. Fortunately, this is the perfect size for testing, and it is available in other length options, so it's worth experimenting before committing to a larger project."

Upon unrolling a portion, I checked with my wire gauge, and indeed it's 22 gauge. On the spool itself there is zero information. There is no sticker, there is nothing. The spool was not correctly closed either. It was held closed with a piece of tape. My friend and I decided to unroll the spool and calculate the total length, as the spool was not full, and the spool was short by 2 meters. BE AWARE that when you pull this wire apart, part of the red portion sticks to the black ( negative ) wire and the red wire is now exposed in areas because the red outer coating has been pulled away and is stuck to the black wire.

All was going fine, until I went to push the connector and wires into the junction box. Almost immediately, with just a little bit of resistance placed on the wire as it was put into the junction box, the wires starting dislodging from the connector.

It’s still perfectly usable but just feels different. I use it to feed anemometer signals from out in the yard, it works fine though it’s pretty stiff but I expect it’ll be entirely satisfactory. There’s a thin over cover, a foil outer layer, a well grouped strand of some kind of plastic threads for longitudinal strength, a woven bare metal woven ground wire and then the 4 conductors - red, black, white and green. The outer sheath is very easy to cut but feels very strong. The individual wires strip easily but the coating feels tough. All in all it’s easy to work with and after all, it’s not going to Mars.",

      "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ <b>Quality wire in a durable jacket</b> I acquired this cable to wire some repair some existing lights and add supplemental warning lights on my tractor. Wire for rear tractor lighting needs to be run along the underside where brush, sticks, briars claw away at it constantly. More than once, I have had wiring damaged or destroyed. I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications. I really like this wire, and I look forward to using it to upgrade my tractor warning lights in preparation for spring. It would be equally suitable for use on a mowers or trailers as well. I think this product will provide adequate protection for wiring in a tough environment for a long time. In fact, with good end connections, I am hopeful that it will last as long as the equipment.",

The wiring gauge is 16 gauge. For my indoor LED application, this is a thicker gauge than I need. The main downside is that the cable is about 1/2\" in diameter. That is a bit thick for some places I have to run it. The wire can be bent around a very tight turn radius without breaking or damaging some of the strands. The wire comes with some zip ties, heat shrink tubs and band to keep the wire from unspooling. This wire does work out well for some application. It would work great with outdoor landscape lighting if need 6 separate conductors. Each strand is clearly color coded so that makes this easier to work with.

This is a good size/length/gauge to keep on hand. This is flexible but a bit rigid, as you'd expect from four 16-gauge wires, each insulated and all encased in a secondary insulator. You can easily separate it if you need to, but I also keep single and double rolls of wire for other needs.",
      "B0BWY3JGGV ★★★★★ <b>Good stuff.</b> The wire inside is silver in color, but I believe that is because it is already tinned. However, it does make me concerned that this is aluminum wire and not copper. I used it for a wiring project on my car, extending the leads from a wiring harness that was too short. It worked beautifully for that. Aside from that the rolls are great - provide a wide assortment of colors, the insulation is good, and it is indeed 20AWG stranded wire.

      "B01M8F9ZVX ★★★★★ <b>Works great for creating HT counterpoises.</b> I'm a ham operator and purchased this to construct HT counterpoises. My previous counterpoise was regular insulated copper wire and it became a pain keeping it straight, as to store the 19.5\" wire when not in use you wrap it around the HT. When unwrapping it the wire would retain the bends and would not hang straight down as you want. Trying to smooth it out and remove the bends was pretty much pointless, and it would want to keep curling back. Then when you stowed your HT, it would happen again when you pulled it out again and unwound it. I saw a recommendation to use silicone-insulated wire as it was much more flexible. I gave it a shot, and it is indeed much better for this purpose. The wire retains a little bit of memory when you unwind it, but a few smoothing passes of your hand down it gets it pretty straight, and it will \"loosen up\" even more over time. I get better performance out of this compared to my prior counterpoise, but that could be the result of intentionally going down a wire gauge to a thicker wire, the line staying straighter, the increased number of strands inside compared to the previous wire, the difference in connecting (soldering a wire loop versus using a terminal ring) or a combination of all four.",

It is useful for medium-draw circuits like LV power supplies and LED lighting. The color-coding is particularly useful for the same reasons. I like my Red Green Blue & White wires to my LEDs to actually be RGBW in color. This kit has enough wire for several small projects and also comes with colored shrink tubing and colored wire ties. I have professional wire strippers but the one in the kit will go in one of my field bags just in case.",
      "B09X45RZCQ ★★★★★ <b>Great Silicone Wire</b> Superb quality wire for the money. Super flexible with plenty of tinned strands. Would definitely buy again!",
      "B07T19567J ★★★★★ <b>Perfect for thermostat upgrades</b> After 65 years of service, we decided to upgrade our mercury switch Honeywell thermostats to smart Nest thermostats. This required more conductors, so the 18/6 fit the bill perfectly. The individual conductors are color coded. The gauge is sufficient for long-ish runs. The outside insulation is very durable, which is useful for pulling through tight spots. The new thermostats work great with the new wire.",
      "B07NPJB5W8 ★★★★★ <b>If you need flexible wiring, this product can't be beat</b> I've used the 8 and 14AWG for application in which the wire is encased in a coiled tube that expands and contracts as a telescopic mount is raised and lowered. The wire must be flexible in this application since it bends each time the coil expands and contracts. This wire consists of many fine strands of flexible copper encased in a silicone rubber sheathing. Very flexible - absolutely perfect for an application in which the wire must bend to accommodate the movement of a mechanical device. And I might add, at a very competitive price.",
      "B0BYNNJS8B ★★★★★ <b>Excellent</b> What is there to say about a spool of wire? It's exactly as described. The jacket feels great and is flexible silicone. The wire is indeed stranded and does appear to be tinned copper, though I haven't confirmed this. The wire itself is flexible but stiff enough to hold it's shape after being bent, like stranded copper would do. This is one reason I believe it to be copper and not aluminum. Either way this wire is nicer to work with than your standard \"hook up\" general purpose wire. It takes solder beautifully as well. The \"THLY 12 Gauge Silicone Wire\" gets a glowing recommendation and a 5/5 from this happy tinkerer.",
      "B071XHSL6K ★★★★★ <b>Exactly what you need</b> High-strand silicon wire is really flexible and slightly harder to solder than regular stranded copper. But, this is very useful for robots and RC equipment. This wire solders really well to RC connectors like XT60s and Deans connectors. Highly recommend",
      "B0BPQDDNBV ★★★★★ <b>Nice hight quality wire, with nice looking sleeve.</b> Wires are very nice quality, worked great for wiring my sand rail for taillights and turnsignals. Nice looking with the included sleeve. Contains the wiring to prevent wires from being exposed, looking messy. Definitely will be looking into getting more when I need some. Was able to run a single length of wire for taillights, turn signals, brake lights and ground. Perfect color coding for this. Highly recommend if you are looking for wiring lights or accessories on RVs, boats, autos, and other toys.",
      "B09V56LTY5 ★★★★★ <b>Good coil of wire</b> Just be aware that this is PVC, not silicone. It is more like traditional stranded lamp wire than the newer style super flexible silicone with a million strands in each conductor. If you bend a strand off to the side, it will hold that shape, like, say normal picture wire. This is not a criticism, just saying this is more of a traditional hook up wire, which is just right if that is what you are looking for. Good jacket, stripped easily without breaking any strands, priced competitively. Recommended.",
      "B0CG1GSW3P ★★★★☆ <b>Good copper lines</b> Some nice set of color coded and gauged length of copper wire. The insulation is decently flexible and combined with the stranded copper wire makes it simple enough for running the wires The copper wire itself is low resistance with decent power handling capabilities and will have lower voltage drop compared to stock wires that come with things. With all this length I will be using this wire to replace and upgrade power supply cables, solar power terminals, jumpers, ebike power cables, and a couple other project items that have low quality and stiff wires.",
      "B09V56LTY5 ★★★★★ <b>High quality jacketed dual core wire</b> This wire looks absolutely excellent. It has a thick PVC jacket that protects the inner conductors but it is still quite flexible. I would have no trouble using this in outdoor or harsh environments like automotive work. The oxygen-free tinned copper looks nice and is a hallmark of quality conducting wire. The inner cores are color coded red and black so it's easy to keep track of them if you are doing a long run. This is going to be my go-to power wire for most small electronics projects for a long time.",

      "B07H3TV5LC ★★★★★ <b>seems like good wire to me</b> I'm an electrical engineer whose worked with a lot of different wire, but I hadn't bought \"bendable silicone wire\" before. I've only worked with it a few times, but it seems like good stuff to me. Very thin strands that should allow it to flex many times w/o breaking. It's a lot better than the typical wire I buy that doesn't flex easily.",
      "B0CN9FNFZC ★★★★★ <b>Excellent cable, a bit overkill for thermostat</b> This is a very good cable, perhaps overkill for thermostat wire. It has 8 conductors and a very thick PVC jacket. The strands are of tinned copper (See image where I scratched off the tin coat). Colors on the strands: White, Black, Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Yellow, Brown. There is plenty of chalk when removing the outer sleeve. Chalk is used to keep moisture out, which makes it less combustible. It's not riser rated though. Marking on the cable: ESHENG PAI STYLE2497435P 2464 18AWG 80ºC 300V VW-I 1 A 18AWG 80ºC 300V PTI TRIUMPHCABLE So, a legit, good quality Triumph Wire (China) cable sold under a seemingly random name. It's exactly as described on the listing. Keep in mind that this is stranded wire and the jacket is a bit thick. It's very flexible, so it does work as a thermostat wire although overkill. Because it's stranded, it's not as quick working on it as a solid wire. So not ideal as a thermostat cable, but a quality cable regardless.",
      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ <b>Great Value For 4-Conductor 18AWG Wire</b> What’s not to like about this wire? The flame retardant and IP68 ratings make it ideal for automotive use and the 18AWG copper conductors are suitable for many related applications. The black PVC jacket has a glossy finish, so be aware if you have aesthetic considerations. Each of the four wires have nicely tinned copper conductors and the red/black/yellow/blue colors are common to many circuits. You can easily strip the external black PVC and use the individual wires as needed. This is a solid deal for a combined 200’ of 18AWG wire for less than $40. The included zip ties and heat shrink were a nice bonus.",
      "B09Y9B4PVN ★★★★★ <b>Sturdy, Flexible Insulation</b> Great for electronic projects if you want the wiring to have a more premium feel. Other wire insulation types can be damaged with excessive bending, but this one is extremely resistant to that type of damage.",
      "B08R35TKZ1 ★★★★★ <b>very nice wire</b> ThIS wire is VERY floppy (good quality) it's fine strand, silver in color and untwisted, but it twists nicely when you need it to to easily fit into the end of a 10 gauge connector. The insulation is thick and very pliable, like it's made of high grade silicone or something so it's not very resistenant to tears on sharp corners, but once installed, probably impervious to heat, chemicals and even dirt under the hood of a car.",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>This has a good selection of 18 awg stranded wre</b> This is an excellent wire kit for all kinds of electronc work. Very flexible high temperature wire. The box that wre comes in makes a great dispenser. Comes with some heat shrink and zip tyes.",

      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Decent wire</b> Got the 6-color 16ga assortment. Like most silicone wire this is very flexible due to the silicone insulation and the fine stranded wire. Was going to knock it down a star for just using tinned wire, but that is upfront in the description, and reflected in the price. Just factor in that the current rating for tinned wire is going to be less than same size in copper. The box is sturdy enough to be a reasonable storage box.",
      "B0BKPBRFF2 ★★★★☆ <b>Decent power cable</b> Seems decent. The outer jacket is tough and seems abrasion resistant. The three conductors are sheathed in a flimsy covering, I’m not sure what purpose it serves. Finally, the stranded wires are ductal and appear to be of good composition.",

      "B0CN9FNFZC ★★★★☆ <b>High-quality and flexible low voltage wire but a little smaller than true 18awg wire</b> This wire seems to be a high-quality wire with a nice and durable jacket. The wire is nice and flexible, even with the durable jacket. This wire features 8 different color conductors, black, white, red, yellow, blue, green, orange, and brown. After stripping the jacket back and revealing the conductors, I noticed the conductors seemed to be a little smaller than the true 18awg wire I am familiar with. As mentioned in another comment, this seems to be the case with this particular wire, as proven by another reviewer's wire resistance test. The following is printed on the wire's jacket. ESHENG PAL STYLE249743SP 2464 18AWG 80°C 300V VW-1 I A 18AWG 80°C 300V FT1 TRIUMPHCABLE Overall, this wire seems to be great wire for many low-voltage, low-current applications where an extra level of protection is needed such as automotive LED lighting, marine LED lighting, etc. Although the wire doesn't seem to be a true 18awg wire, it will function well for a wide variety of applications, assuming the wire is not expected to carry the full 18awg current.",

      "B0BWY3JGGV ★★★★★ <b>I can't believe I waited this long to get good wire.</b> Honestly in all my 32 years of working in/on electronics I have never come across wire like this. The jacket is rated at 200˚C but it seems much higher. It doesn't shrink back or melt at all. It is very pliable and durable. But then somehow strips very very easily with a razor blade... The strands ARE tinned but STILL only clock-in @ 0.08mm. So 59 strands for 22AWG. And yet it still retains your 'Pre-Solder Twist'. I'm decidedly both impressed and confused.. Rant complete. Highly recommended",
      "B003J699RW ★★★★★ <b>Better than expected</b> I can strip it at 18 and it's strong stranded wire, and I like it. With a few pinches at 16 gauge it strips. It's stiffer than all the other 18 I am soldering into, so it takes a little work for a good solder. The wire casing is durable and flexible enough.",

      "B09CCK5BD7 ★★★★★ <b>Tinned Copper Stranded Red & Black Joined Cover 10/2 Gauge Low Voltage(300V Max) Wire-30 Feet</b> I needed a long length of red and black low voltage wire in 10 AWG (American Wire Gauge) using stranded wire. This has 30 feet of parallel joined jacket R&B conductors using tinned copper stranded wire rated for up to 300 Volts. I'm using it for no more than 48 Volts DC so this will do just fine. Stranded wire is more flexible and less prone to fatigue breakage. I do wish this had the more modern silicone insulating jacket which has better flexibility and resistance to oil. It is more costly. I stripped an end to show the tinned strands and scraped off some tinning to show the true copper conductor core, not Copper Clad Aluminum (CCA) which is cheaper. The tinning will enhance my ease of soldering this wire. I Recommend this iGreely Store 10 Gauge Wire - iGreely 30 FT 10/2 Gauge Tinned Copper Low Voltage Wire Electrical Wire Cable for Solar Panel Car Audio Automotive Trailer Marine Harness Wiring 10AWG 30Ft. Good wire at a fair value for my needs. I hope you’ve found the information and my review helpful.",
      "B09DSQ9YLC ★★★★★ <b>Great wire for projects</b> This wire is nice and flexible, which can be a welcome change from regular copper wires I’ve used before. The silicon coating feels pretty nice and looks good, while the wires inside seem great. There’s plenty of strands so manipulating and soldering together goes pretty smoothly. I got the 14awg set and you get many many small strands of wire that add up the a larger core diameter. Would I use this is large applications that require high amps? Probably not honestly, I think I would be a bit more comfortable with a solid core, but if you treat this a step lower on the wire gauge I think that would be a good enough buffer. They’ve been nice to work with, easy to strip the sheathing off the ends, just a good option overall for wiring.",
      "B0CN316VHN ★★★★★ <b>Great value, fills a gap in my supply cabinet</b> Sometimes my projects call for something larger than my 20 gauge hookup wire and my 14 gauge speaker wire on hand is overkill. This wire fills that gap nicely. This is a nice well insulated length of stranded 16 gauge wire. It stripped nicely for me. Even though they promote this as a low voltage landscape wire, I heard a rumor that it will carry electrons down the wire for other applications as well. Wire is more about current than voltage anyway. This would easily power a several hundred watt load at 120 volts and would vaporize at much lower voltages if the current was very high. Overall, a good value for wire that can be used for many things.",
      "B0CK4WHWBY ★★★★★ <b>Good 3-conductor wire for LED strips</b> This is great 3-conductor wire for LED strips, like WS2811 LEDs. The three conductors all share a common outer jacket that is rated for outdoor use (waterproof, burial). The colors are red/black/yellow, so it doesn’t use the common WS2811 color schemes, but that doesn’t matter. Each strand is 18 AWG, and should be able to safely carry up to about 12 amps. It’s just the wire cut straight off the spool, so you will need to be ready to strip and prep the ends yourself, but that’s exactly what’s expected for this. Very satisfied, 5 stars.",

This is copper wire, NOT CCA wire (copper coated aluminum). Each lead, red and black have a substantial insulating cover. In addition, both leads/wires are surrounded by another insulation layer that binds everything together. The finished product is round and smooth. This is designed as a direct burial wire. That means it can be used outside, including in the dirt just as it is. However, remember to make all connections perfectly watertight. Part of my project will have the wire exposed to direct sunlight. So I feel certain it will hold up for a long time. Today I made connections using this wire by soldering as well as crimping connectors. I was super pleased with how it performed. Thanks for reading my review!

Hook that to the Sprout center blue wire. Mirror at the control box. It works. NOTE: Will only fix one bad wire. There are others that will fix up to 3 bad wires. Instructions say to water protect the red bulbous end of the Sprout used in the ground box, as it is only water resistant, by placing a large water proof connector over it.

      "B0CN9FNFZC ★★★★★ <b>Nice well made cable</b> Nice highly flexible 18 gage wire. It is tinned, so if you plan to solder, that is even better. I am using this as a signal wire from remote/pendant mounted switches to control small relays. For this, it is well suited, possibly a little overkill. But I like having a little heavier gage than what it takes just to get the job done. In my experience, it lasts longer and more forgiving to unexpected issues and faults. The outer sheath is not terribly difficult to cut, but I do not think average use will cause damage to it. Probably not suited to use in a manufacturing plant where it would be subjected to many types of abuse. But for the average DIY home entrepreneur, it would likely be just fine. I think we all take better care of things when it is us who foot the bill to pay for them. The individual wires are color coded (think thermostat wire), so they are easily identifiable on each end. As mentioned they are tinned, so the are easily soldered as well. I like soldered connections. They are more trouble to install, but, when properly done, I feel they are extremely reliable and with lower resistance due to more surface contact area. Soldering is not always an option, but these wires will do just fine when crimped as well.",

I didn't really need the full spec of this wire, but I mostly wanted some really flexible wire because connecting a charger to a car battery is hard enough already. This is really finely stranded wire, and the silicone insulation both make it super-flexible. It may see incidental contact with engine parts, etc., so the temp rating (200 C) may be useful. I was soldering this to copper-coated steel clips, so I was really doggin' the heat to it to get a good joint, and the insulation which was butted to the terminals didn't shrink back or burn at all. So this is a really nice, super-flexible, heat-resistant cable for a great price. The two conductors separate really easily, so you'll want to put something for a stopper to keep it from \"unzipping.\" I'm going to put a silicone blob where the wires split. It ships coiled in a bag, not on a roll, but it was well packaged and shipped quickly.",

      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★★☆ <b>Very fine strands. Insulation is average.</b> This review is for the 10 Gauge, 15ft, 2 conductor Arrives in a zip bag with a Made in China barcode sticker on it 614.7g (1.35Lbs) I believe that 30ft of 10ga copper should be 0.0306hm at 77° F I measured 0.0326 Ohm at closer to 70° F, and that cooler temperature should have skewed the result lower. But at such low impedance difference I can’t say that the wire is not in compliance with its rating Jacket claims 200° C temperature rating Some odor but nothing out of the ordinary I concur with other reviewers here that the insulation is average at best. Four stars but that is half based on the competitive price of $26 for 30ft 10ga. If you are looking for fine strand flexibility, this is great. If you require a high voltage rating or other confidence in the performance of the insulation then you should look elsewhere",

      "B0BWWW6PJK ★★★★☆ <b>Nicely made cable that has the described wires with a good coating for protection and a ground wire.</b> The 6/3 6 AWG Power Cable by Arizona Electrical Solutions, is a very nice cable that’s heavy duty coated to protect and ready for install. It looks to be as described with all copper wires and is made of good quality materials that lead me to believe it should serve me very well and last a long time. It comes with seemingly durable insolation around each wire and more around the whole cable, making it a great outdoor or industrial cable for many things. Each 6 AWG wire is made up of 7 smaller copper wires wrapped in a plastic type coating. So far it has worked without any issues, but I’ll be sure to update this review, if I ever start to have problems with it. If you’d find it helpful to see an up-close visual inspection of this product, I recommend you watch my included video in full screen or landscape. They say a picture is worth a 1000 words, well it’s a video! You can trust that this review is simply my honest opinion that is attempting to provide you with helpful insight that I wish I had before I picked this product. Hopefully it was helpful in your decision.",

      "B0BYKB2PWS ★★★★★ <b>Good gauge and flexible. Easy to bury.</b> Hello, fellow homeowners and outdoor enthusiasts! I recently tried the UBOORY 16/2 Low Voltage Landscape Wire and I must say this is a great product. This 16-gauge, 2-conductor wire is perfect for outdoor direct burial electrical wiring needs, and it is built to last. The copper wire construction is durable and resistant to wear and tear, ensuring that it can withstand the elements and provide reliable performance for years to come. I appreciate the most about this wire is how easy it is to work with. It is flexible and easy to bend, making it easy to route around landscaping features and other obstacles. It is also color-coded for easy identification and installation, which made the process of setting up my outdoor lighting system a breeze. The 50-foot length is more than enough for most outdoor projects, and the low voltage rating ensures that it is safe to use around plants and other outdoor features. This wire is ideal for use with low voltage LED lighting systems, which are becoming increasingly popular for their energy efficiency and ease of use. This cable works great with waterproof connectors, or waterproof wire nuts. Overall, I highly recommend the UBOORY 16/2 Low Voltage Landscape Wire to anyone who is in need of a reliable and high-quality wire for their outdoor electrical needs. It is easy to work with, durable, and provides excellent performance. It has definitely been a great addition to my outdoor lighting system, and I'm sure it will be for you too!",
      "B0CPPWBGT8 ★★★★★ <b>Nice low voltage cable</b> I used this 2 wire 14ga cable to run between 2 outdoor camera stations in the woods. The cable insulation seems excellent and the stranded conductors make it very flexible. Because the wire is tinned it soldered very easily. Pleased with it.",
      "B01KWBPC7M ★★★★★ <b>Very decent wire. In depth review & Pics</b> Running some permanent LED strips in the living room vaulted ceiling. Needed wire to run through the attic from the LED strips to a controller about 22 feet away. Wanted something heavier than the 22 gauge wire you find everywhere, and I wanted 100 foot spool Those two combinations limited what was out there. Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white). Even with my current strips, would have been nice to be able to upgrade without having to re-run wire. Oh well, happy anyway!",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Very nice test lead wire</b> I ordered the 12ga wires in black and red. The wire is very flexible and feels nice in the hands.

      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★☆ <b>Nice wire with a nice, well balanced silicone jacket</b> I like the idea of wide temperature range wire and silicone insulation - its a good combination for a lot of difficult situations - and this is a nice version. This wire (#22) has insulation that is slightly thicker than some PVC insulations but not a lot thicker. Its easy to strip the insulation but its not so soft that it tears or can be crushed off the wire easily - I've had silicone insulation that was just to fragile and this is perfect - The slightly tougher insulation is slightly stiffer but its a much better compromise for applications where the wiring won't be completely protected in a sleeve - even inside an enclosure, some of them are too easily damaged and this holds up well. Colors are very solid/bright - no issues there The conductor is very finely stranded and individually tinned strands - very nice construction and easy to work with. Seems like very nice wire - good combination of insulation and stranding and easy to identify colors - nice little kit of spools.",
      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ <b>Nice Long Roll...</b> I picked this up for the 1001 projects I'm working on, what was a benefit for my project but might be a drawback for others is that the outer insulator is not bonded to the inner wires... I like this because when needed I can easily remove the outer sleeve and get 4 individual wires without much work, and it also seems to allow the cable more flex... The presentation when opening the package was really nice, with two velcro straps holding it in a nice coil, the outer sleeve cut back a few inches and the wires stripped on both ends... The bag with several small pieces of heat shrink and some nylon zip ties was a nice addition...",

      "B0BXKLS2T4 ★★★★★ <b>Actual real copper wire, unlike many other brands, and exactly as advertised. Very pleased.</b> I've previously ordered silicone sheathed wire from suppliers like BNTechGo and others which advertise as \"stranded copper wire\", but are no such thing. They might have a single strand of copper in each wire, and the rest be aluminum, but they are certainly not predominantly copper. The wire strands look and feel nothing like solid copper. Enter Shonsin brand, who I only recently discovered. I ordered this 10AWG cable hoping that for once it might be what was actually advertised, and for once I was pleasantly surprised ! Real solid copper strands, great flexibility, wire gauge to specification, nice flexible silicone sheath that doesn't shrink back when soldering or using heatshrink with a heatgun. Exactly what it should be. The outer diameter of the 10AWG wire was a little larger than ideal for part of my project (my fault for not checking, since it's EXACTLY as they list in their description and sizing/gauge table), and since for that specific use I can get away with 12AWG electrically, I just placed an order for some of their 12AWG cable too. I'm still using the 10AWG cable where the size permits, and will just use the 12AWG for the wires that needs to pass through a small grommet. Hopefully the 12AWG wire is just as good as the 10AWG that I'm already using. Buying shorter lengths is always a little pricey, but this brand seems better quality by far than any of the other brands I've tried (and no more expensive for similar lengths)",
      "B0B5DSNSFX ★★★★☆ <b>A bit thick for automotive use, but works</b> This is a very flexible multi strand wire That looks to be of very good quality. The silicone insulation is very smooth which would make it easy to pull through tight spaces. The insulation is like that of high-quality test leads. I would be careful where you apply this wire and should only use it for low current low voltage applications. I will be using this on my truck to wire some additional lights. This is probably a bit too thick for my application, but it should work fine. I would advise against using this cable for in home use applications.",
      "B0BPQDDNBV ★★★★★ <b>Horay for OFC!</b> I didn't realize what the big deal with CCA (copper clad aluminum) was until I tried to solder it, that was rough. This is pure copper, I don't fully understand what the \"oxygen free\" portion means vs any other copper, but it sure is nice and easy to solder! This is kind of specialized wire with four color-coded conductors within a durable and flexible PVC jacket. The jacket is so tough that I would trust using it in an automotive application without additional conduit or sleeving. I think I will use some of it to add power door locks to a classic car that doesn't have any, seems like it will be flexible enough to withstand the door opening and closing many times without issue.",
      "B0C31HDK5P ★★★★☆ <b>Insulation’s adequate but kinda thin</b> This version of the excellent beldon wire has thinner insulation and is thinner overall than I’ve gotten before. It’s still perfectly usable but just feels different. I use it to feed anemometer signals from out in the yard, it works fine though it’s pretty stiff but I expect it’ll be entirely satisfactory. There’s a thin over cover, a foil outer layer, a well grouped strand of some kind of plastic threads for longitudinal strength, a woven bare metal woven ground wire and then the 4 conductors - red, black, white and green. The outer sheath is very easy to cut but feels very strong. The individual wires strip easily but the coating feels tough. All in all it’s easy to work with and after all, it’s not going to Mars.",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>Great wire for hobbyists</b> This wire kit makes a great kit for hobbyists who need several pieces of different colored wires in a project. This kit comes with 8 rolls of wire (brown, white, black, red, orange, blue, yellow, and green), a bag of zip ties, a bag of heat-shrink tubing, and a wire stripper. The bags of zip ties and heat-shrink tubing include zip ties and heat-shrink tubing that match the colors of the wires with the exception of black zip ties. The kit I received did not include any black zip ties but those are easy to find elsewhere. The wire features silicone insulation and is very flexible. The insulation is soft enough that it can be easily stripped by simply pinching and pulling on the insulation. This makes the wire easy to work with but causes some concern for how easy the wire could be damaged. The box features holes that make it easy to pull the wires out of the box while keeping the spools contained in the box. The included wire stripper is very simple but a good addition to the kit. Most hobbyists will prefer to use their own wire strippers, but some beginners may find the included wire stripper useful. Overall, this wire kit seems like a great kit for hobbyists who prefer a clean and organized project and workspace.",

      "B08R35TKZ1 ★★★★★ <b>This is the good stuff, tinned copper, super flexible, relatively thick silicone jacket</b> This is probably among the better silicone wires I've used. It is tinned copper, as evident by two facts: the ends of the strands are red when cut, and it takes solder very easily. This is exactly what you want, as fine stranded bare copper would corrode too easily. The jacket is definitely a good quality high temp silicone, and is on the thicker side for silicone wire. I prefer this, as silicone jackets generally tear easily if they are too thin. The wire gauge is at least true to size. I haven't stripped and weighed it, but it fits snugly in my 10AWG crimp terminals. The only way this could possibly be made better is if the wire was made from 7 bunches of twisted strands, with the combined cable twisted the other direction. This improves flexibility and keeps strands together after stripping.",

Being this flexible, it acts unlike any other copper wire we've used before, possible being due to the high strand count (252!) and the highly flexible silicone insulator. It worked well under the hood of our car to temporarily run the cooling fan in the intense summer heat. It obviously stands up to heat very well. Excellent product!",

The wire itself is very fine stranded, it could be used for speaker wire. Very pleased and highly recommend it.",
      "B07CN1MF7S ★★★★★ <b>Great for test leads</b> This is two individual conductors rolled together on one spool. It’s a finely bundled conductor with supple silicone insulation. It’s probably not very sturdy against abrasion. The price I paid at the time of purchase was reasonable. The wire solders nicely into typical multimeter probes. The wire bends easily and doesn’t have a stiff memory, and therefore is ideal for bench work.",

      "B096JZCT1B ★★★★★ <b>Fits the bill for the job</b> I’m a DIYer who recently ran a new five-conductor thermostat wire in preparation for adding a smart thermostat at an existing forced hot air furnace installation. I bought the 50 foot spool of thermostat wire for that project from a big box store. This item’s packaging, in contrast, comes in a cardboard box of significantly smaller dimension than the big box store’s spool of wire, which was in a clear plastic bag. As seen in the photo, the box is maybe 5 inches square and about a couple inches tall. I gave some thought to this. If I were an HVAC contractor, I think the smaller footprint of this item’s design would be a better approach for easy storage when in the field. But the downside to this is the wire’s coiled memory may make fishing the wire a bit more challenging than the wider diameter of the big box version. Aside from this interesting but probably trivial difference, this item seems perfect for its intended purpose. It strips well with the usual wire stripper tools. Continuity was verified with all five conductors. The conductors’ colors match industry standard. Coming from the aforesaid DIYer here, I guess you can take that with a healthy grain of salt :) but I think we’re on page that this the right design for thermostats needing five conductors. I intend to use this item to re-wire an existing smart thermostat installation at a different property, where the existing wiring is rather amusing but functional. I think this item is up to the task and look forward to using it. I think it will also serve me well when I take on some nifty Arduino project with external sensors that need to be wired up. All kinds of cool possibilities here. Glad I picked this item.",

The inside color-coded wires are wrapped in paper and each has thick insulation over very fine, tinned wires. I'm using this cable for alarm power/sensor wiring and it's ideal. Highly recommended.",
      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ <b>Outstanding value!</b> This cable is an outstanding value! Between the 4 conductors in the cable, you get 400ft of wire for $50 right now. Naoevo also included a whole whack of zip ties and heat shrink tubing which is an excellent inclusion to help with your wire install. The outer layer is a kind of thin rubber or plastic sheathing. It doesn't feel super strong, but it'll keep your wires organised over long runs. It'll also look better than 4 loose wires. The wires themselves are true 18 gauge and helpfully color coated to ensure you get your connections in the right place. The outer sheathing is a little bit annoying to strip away since it's so stretchy, but if you cut it vertically with your wire cutters, then clip off the verticle strips, you can get 'er done. The individual wire insulation is easy to strip and work with though. As far as the application for this kind of wire, I used this to have a clean run from my home theater receiver out to my rear channel speakers. Keeps the four wires nice and clean for the long main cable run, then you can strip back the outer sheathing where you need to connect the speakers themselves. This would also be excellent for car applications. This stiffer wire is easier to push through the car interior than single floppy wires are. All in all, as said at the start, this is a great value for all that wire and the included install gear. If you need versitile wire at a great price, this is for you!",

This kit gave me most of what I needed. The conductor is nicely flexible and looks to be of good quality, a tin-coated, very fine braid. However it runs smaller than the gauge indicates, and you need to dig into the specs to see this. For comparison, the DXC uses 0.75mm^2 wire, which is equivalent between 20 and 22 ga, or the same size as this wire's \"18 gauge.\" A second issue is with the soft silicone installation. My application has some rubbing during installation and tear-down. After the first time, I have bare spots where the wire contacts itself.",

This wire is rated at 600V, which means it is o.k. for use in most vacuum tube amplifiers (not HAM stuff, but audio stuff, where voltages don't often exceed 600VDC.) I do wish the manufacturer offered a 17 color version, or a striped version, as ten colors rapidly runs out. Other than that, a nice bunch of wire.

Unlike some low voltage landscape lighting cables, this does not look appropriate for direct burial. There are however, 2 layers of insulation to the cable: color coded (red and black) insulators on each conductor and a thicker protective insulator on the exterior. The wire gauge is quite light at #18, so it is especially good for LED lights which don't draw much current. I would also feel comfortable using it on a single halogen fixture at 20 watts or less. Overall the thin profile of the cable lends itself to being able to tuck it away easily and out of sight. I will likely be using it under a deck to power LV light fixtures.",

You will ALWAYS need wire for the many projects associated with old cars. I need single strands, double strands, four strands, and even more strands. This roll of wire contains the 4 strands. With 4 strands inside the single casing, this will allow for the 4 contained strands to be pulled without the mess of 4 individual strands being pulled and having to be taped, loomed, or wire tied for wire management. The 4 individual contained wires are also color coded for easy identification on each end of the contained wire.

The wire itself is okay. The sheathing is strange, not like any wire I have handled before. The page claims it is silicone so that might be why. The strands the wire itself is made of are very thin. This makes it hard to strip the sheathing off of without also pulling out some strands. My automatic strippers were too strong to strip this so I had to do each wire manually. The included heat shrink tube is cheap. It does what it is supposed to do, shrink, but it is very plastic-y and not flexible. Not bad for a cheap wire kit, but I was expecting more.",

I had to purchase more cat 5E because I ran short and I Purchased it from Lowe’s. My fingers are not A micrometer, but I can feel the difference with my fingers that the wire is thinner than what I purchased at Lowe’s. At this point it appears to be causing me some connectivity issues.

      "B0BY25MWGN ★★★★★ <b>This is the real deal</b> I've been disappointed by lots of wire I've purchased on Amazon. I was delighted with this wire. It's a true 12 AMERICAN Wire Gauge (not Chinese Wire Gauge which looks like 50% insulation and 50% wire). Fine, high strand count. The jacket is real silicone and fantastic. Unbelievably flexible and will stay that way even in extremely cold temperatures. Well worth the cost.",
      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★★★ <b>Very flexible, resists abrasion and heat</b> This is the wire you want to use for charging lithium batteries. At 10 gauge there will be very little voltage drop between the power supply and the battery and digital voltage on the power supply will reflect the voltage on the battery. Amazon delivered this wire last night and I didn't find it till morning. The package was covered in snow and it was 20F. I opened the package, and this wire was as flexible as it could be. I started to make a cable with it and noticed the two wires split very easily, too easily. With only moderate use this wire will keep separating. The ends should always have a piece of heat shrink tubing at the ends to prevent it from becoming two wires, even when storing. That is partially an effect of the insulation being so flexible. From the picture you can see how many small flexible strands there are. I measured one with my caliper and the reading was 0.002 inches. This is really nice wire to work with because of the extreme flexibility. I took a piece of insulation and hit it with my soldering iron set to 593F. The insulation didn't burn, smoke or even make a dent. This is just super wire to use for higher current applications.",

This paired wire is made so the individual wire can be pulled apart and still retain their insulation. The wire insulation is black so it will withstand the elements well. It's a 100 foot roll to make sure you don't come up short. The strands are pretty stiff and should crumple when you slide them into connectors and it's solid copper so it will solder well. Cons: None from me.",
      "B0CSD35PQT ★★★★☆ <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone.",

      "B0CG1GSW3P ★★★★★ <b>Excellent 10-Gauge Copper Wire</b> The headline on the webpage says 12-gauge, but it’s actually 10-gauge wire. Someone said it was aluminum core, but that is not true. It is TINNED COPPER which gives the color of aluminum unless you look at the cut end of the wire. Then, you can see it is definitely copper core. You could also measure its resistance. It measures 0.031 ohms resistance in 30’. That’s equivalent to 1.033 ohms per 1000’. The standard for resistance of 10-gauge copper wire is 1.018 ohms per 100’ @ 25° C. Aluminum wire (10-gauge) is 1.649 ohms @ 25° C. My reading was at 24° C. Therefore, it’s copper wire. This wire is extremely flexible because of its silicone insulation and the extremely fine wire strands that make up the wire core. That makes it easy to work with and very desirable. Amazon Vine sent this product to me for an honest unbiased review. Would I recommend it? Yes, I’m looking forward to using this wire to run power to my trailer’s winch. It’s high quality and very useful.",
      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★★ <b>Looks really good. Real tinned copper. Very slinky</b> There's not a whole lot to say about this wire that hasn't been said in other reviews already. I ordered the 12 awg with 10 feet of each red and black. I was just trying to round out my stock a bit as I already had some 10, 14 and 16 awg silicone wire around. I tend to order BNTechGo as I tried them once and was plenty happy with it. This stuff seems just as good as far as I can tell. My main concern was if it was real tinned copper or not so I stripped a section and scraped it with a sharp knife until I could clearly see the copper start showing through the tin. So yes, this is definitely real copper. The strands are extremely fine, which is great for flexibility but can make it tough to strip without cutting some. But that's the case with all flexible silicone wire, so no real issue there compared to other brands. These 10' sections came in just loose coils in a resealable pouch, which I guess is fine given how short they are; normally I prefer spools. All in all this wire seems just as good as other more established brands and costs less. Works for me.",

It's only a 7' run from the disconnect box so I can cut the wire in half and use one of the conductors from the second half as a ground. It's going in conduit so weather, elements and critters are of no consequence. Still, it's good to know I'm using very good wire. The heating element in the Heat Pump draws 60 amps and requires 6 gauge 3 conductor wire. I finished that last week. I see this wire as a very good deal and a total win for me.

      "B0CRYX1P5T ★★★★★ <b>Very nice tinned pure copper flexible wire</b> This tinned, pure copper wire is as advertised in the product description. It is very flexible with a very high strand count. I use this type of wire all the time because of its flexibility and corrosion resistance. As shown in the photo the silicone sheath is quite thick. Also shown is the well packaged spool. I have had other wire rolls arrive broken because the spool is just shipped in a plastic bag. This wire arrived in a well-labeled, stout cardboard box. Everything I could check showed this wire to be as advertised and of very nice quality. The red/black wires are easily separated, if needed, and maintain a full sheath thickness on separation ( think zip wire). We are very happy with this wire.",
      "B0BXT6SBZ4 ★★★★★ <b>Good selection (colors) of 22AWG | Not for breadboards</b> I got this little spool set to replenish mine for various electronic projects/repairs. The ad (at the time of this review) is spot on, each spool is 22 gauge, 26.2ft long and contains 60 strands (yes I measured & counted them because that's what I do). The insulation is VERY pliable also, it may seem minor but the box is also a dispenser AND it comes with a handful (20 [4 each color]) of heat shrink 1-1/2\" long each. Because this is a 60 strand wire it's not for Bread Boards unless you like tinning wire. I hope this review and video was HELPFUL.",
      "B0CN2RB68V ★★★★★ <b>Takes solder well and silicone jacket is strong and flexible.</b> The conductor bundle is 16 gauge, as measured with a micrometer. The strand count is greater than 120 which helps in making this a flexible wire. The silicone covering is thick, durable, and strips / removes easily. The wires themselves are supple and take solder well. And the dispenser box is a welcome help, as it keeps the spools together and the wire free of tangles.",
      "B0CLBHT8YX ★★★★☆ <b>Good for small projects</b> It seems I'm always scrounging for sections of wire on different RV projects and usually find something leftover from an older finished project that works but maybe is not the best (such as by adding pigtails). This has 5 fifty foot rolls of 5 colors that should end the scrounging. This is a copper clad aluminum core (CCA) wire. The copper reduces corrosion caused by moisture and oxidation and adds surface conductivity. I got it to use for some small 12V wiring projects in the RV (additional 12 volt computer fan for gas refrigerator cooling) and to have on hand when I just need some short lengths of wire. For reference, Cu Clad Al (CCA) wire can be used for main wire projects but at a much larger gauge as aluminum has a higher resistance than copper. 12 AWG is recommended for a 15 Amp 110V circuit and 10 AWG for a 20 Amp. This is a 36 strand 16 AWG braided wire so it's not made for heavy loads or 110 volt wiring. Specs are for up to 80 volts. The wire is flexible and there's enough copper coating for it to solder easily to itself. If there's trouble having the wire stick, a copper infused solder works. I used some lead free Rosin Core 2.0 Sn99 Ag0.3 Cu0.7 electronics solder and everything was sucked into the wire and stuck together. I couldn't find the percent by weight of copper anywhere on the rolls, package, or website. The range for CCA is anywhere from 10% to 24% by weight, with the more the better (but also more expensive). 15 small zip ties and 10 heat shrink tubes are included in the box. I'm never going to use this on a main AC wiring project but for small electrical projects, it's a good economical choice and should last a long time. If you don't want 5 colors and a dispenser box, 4-color roll packages of 100'/roll 16AWG of this brand are the same price if you shop around. 4 stars - copper specs not given.",
      "B0CQFW25HT ★★★★★ <b>Very Useful Electrical Wire to Have for Your Home.</b> This is good three strand wire. Actually, here is a fun fact. because it is stranded it is able to carry more current than the solid gauge wire. I’m not about to go and unravel this whole thing just to measure if they gave 50ft but based on what I am seeing, that appears to be the case. I like this wire, I know it will be useful in the future. I plan to use it to wire some outdoor lights in the sun room at my park model when it opens up again for the season. Upon inspection of the wire it appears brand new and there are no signs of damage anywhere on the wire. I’m not sure why this wire is tinned because generally you would utilize screw on caps in order to secure the junction between two wires in a home rough in environment. Or at least that is how electricians do it so maybe there is a use I am not aware of. Therefore, I would recommend this wire as it is good quality and the listing order is exactly as described.",
      "B09XQWWPD2 ★★★★★ <b>Real copper, flexible, solders and crimps well</b> I just used this wire in a Li-Ion battery project. I like how it is tinned, with a high strand count. Those qualities make it pliable and easy to solder. It is copper, not copper-plated aluminum, making it a better choice for conductivity reasons. It also has burly 105C 600V ratings. Highly recommended.",
      "B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ <b>Thick extension cord cable</b> I didn't realize it when ordering but this is extension cord cable. The outer jacket is nice and thick, and resists wear pretty well.

      "B01N2418AP ★★★★★ <b>Silky handling</b> Okay, it's just wire. But NO! Not all wire is the same. This wire handles beautifully. It feels silky and drapes beautifully. The silicon insulation and high strand count produce this wonderful feeling. It carries current in the same way as any other wire this gauge, but the look and feel of this wire is super nice. Highly recommend it.",
      "B088RCCHTG ★★★☆☆ <b>Really 22AWG (16 strands x 0.16mm), not 20AWG</b> Seems like decent quality wire. It is 16 strands (as advertised), however each strand measures out to 0.16mm, not 0.20mm as advertised. This makes it a 22AWG spec wire.",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★☆ <b>Nice set of 12awg silicone wires</b> Bought a relay/fuse block for my truck to run off the 2nd battery. The relay/fuse block has some really stiff wires, so wanted to redo the wiring with more flexible cables. These did the trick, but, the outer house seems to be really thick. Still bends easily, just thicker than I would like for the outside wire housing. When criping these onto wire terminals, you would almost need to go the next size up due to the thickness of the outer casing. But, it's silicone, so it will crimp with no issues. Nice strand count.",
      "B0CF55452S ★★★★★ <b>The good stuff!</b> Best part about this cabling is it's easy to pull apart the two strands without the wire stripping down to the copper internals. Some cables, when pulled apart, will actually rip far enough apart to expose the underlying copper strands, which requires redoing the split or patching the cable. This landscape wire is definitely not cheap, and does not split. I've used about half of it to run a few dozen lights around my house. Used with multiple LED spotlights and outdoor floods. Used on burial as well as wired along fences exposed to the elements. It's been a few months and zero issues thus far. Get it!",
      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★☆☆ <b>Seems ok. Copper color seems a bit off for some reason.</b> It is silicone, but not quite as soft and flexible as other silicone wire I have used. The tinning and strand count is good. A bit concerning is that it is hard to see the copper to assess it. It is hard to see from the cut end and when I do get a bit of copper color I am not sure if it is a reflection. I scraped the tinning off from the sides and got a little pale pinkish color. Maybe it is just that the strand count is so high (small strands) or that the copper is of a different purity than what I am used to seeing. I am sure the wire is fine, but there is definitely something different about it.",

Two (red and black) wires with its own PVC insulation and there is a PVC outer jacket covering both. Wires are copper (NOT lower conductivity grade Copper Clad Aluminium). I made an actual count and there are exactly 27 strands. The outer jacket can be stripped off with wire stripper at 14AWG, which really indicate the wire is even slightly bigger than 16AWG. Nice wire, with good conductivity and well made. Excellent for extension or versatile use.",
      "B0CH861BMS ★★★★★ <b>Good for cars and boats!</b> Wow! Great looking wire! Tinned copper wire is the way to go! It has the preferred characteristics of copper (low resistance and flexibility) with the corrosion resistance of tin. I have had to throw away pure copper wire from the 70s since it develops green oxidation and is a pain to clean but have yet to have to clean tinned copper before crimping or soldering. This wire has fewer strands that are larger and a heavy PVC outer coating, compared to the small strand silicon coated wire I use for RC helicopters. This makes it stiffer, easier to route, and tougher. I wouldn't hesitate to walk on this wire or pull it across metal edges that would cut silicon insulation. The larger strands are also better for crimping since smaller strands are more likely to break at the crimp. The only negative is the large outer diameter will limit the number of runs you can have in small spaces. Excellent wire! Recommended!",
      "B08FMGHSMY ★★★★★ <b>PROS: FLEXIBLE, RELIABLE, GREAT PRICE-- CONS: NONE I'VE FOUND.</b> This is the best wire I've ever used, hands down. To put this in perspective, I go through probably 100 ft. of automotive primary wire in any given week. I do a LOT of small electrical jobs for friends and family, everything from fixing headlights and wiring harnesses, to adding completely new circuits like heated seats or sound systems. I have 0 sound degradation when I use them for speaker wire. If you use it for that, something I've learned by a lot of real world trial and error, that may help someone else out there, is to run the speaker wires down the opposite side of the car you run the power wires; I don't know why it helps, someone who's smarter than I could tell you..maybe it helps cut out interference or something, but tbh I have no idea at all and am not educated enough on that to tell you the why, I just know that it really works. It's almost like some kind of weird, ancient, wiring feng-shui that yields better performance based on geographical location. Supernatural, ancient, far-east, geo-kinestethic techniques and practices aside, it really just helps get the desired result of clear, non-fuzzy sound... ...Ok! anyways, the crazy flexibility and high-strand count of the conductor inside the insulation makes it stupid dumb easy to push em through tight fitting holes without the need to alter the existing structure of something. They're surprisingly elastic, as well, which helps not tear off end bits of wire if you're like me and use an automatic wire stripper... and insist on having the tension permanently set to \"kill\" 😃. The elasticity of the insulation, which is made of/made with with silicone, also means if it gets caught while you run it, you step on it or slam it in something while pulling the wire, that won't (in my experience) compromise the conductor inside. I know that I SHOULD just replace that section of wire, even if it doesn't appear to be damaged, which I do when time and materials allow... and I know I SHOULD stop eating so much red meat, I know I SHOULD stop smoking, I know I SHOULD finally fix that back door screen that bangs every time the wind blows any faster than is required to move a stupid American Beauty grocery bag... my point is that I SHOULD do a lot of things, but don't always get to. in the real world sometimes you just aren't able to do things by the book, for whatever reason, and this wire hasn't let me down when those situations arise. I'll leave you with my answer to the question \"is this **** good enough to be the only wire ill use for automotive and small electronic applications moving forward?\"... ...\"bet\". PROS: FLEXIBLE, RELIABLE, GREAT AND LONG-LASTING PERFORMANCE, SOLID PRICE RANGE; GREAT BANG FOR YOUR BUCK. CONS: NONE I'VE FOUND. buy it. you're welcome.",
      "B0981NF1HV ★★★★★ <b>good value. cable is reasonably flexible. 7 strand.</b> I liked that the wire is ribbon format, with each wire a different color. the color sequence is strange, but I can work around that. The wires are arranged 4x1 in a flat cable arrangement. Not shielded, so could be subject to interference. Insulation is PVC. Did not evaluate for \"Good for working out\" (made no sense to me.) I guess you could use it as a jump-rope?? I didn't try. where do they come up with these categories?",
      "B0CK4WHWBY ★★★★★ <b>Easy to Work With. Quality Meets Expectations.</b> I've used a lot of wire and this one feels good quality. I found it easy to work with as well (but I also have excellent tools in my kit to work with.) The quality definitely meets my standards. Since I just started using this wire, I should say that I'm not sure how it'll hold up over the long-term. But upon just getting started with it, so far so good. Here are the factors about this wire that were most important to me. The wire is UL2464 compliant, meaning it meets strict quality standards. 9 strands of 0.254mm tinned copper wire, so it's got great conductivity. PVC Jacket seems thick and sturdy - making it durable. It also claims to be flame resistant, though I haven't personally checked that claim. All in all, I'm happy with the wire and feel it was a good choice. I would consider getting it again.",
      "B0BWY3JGGV ★★★★★ <b>I can't believe I waited this long to get good wire.</b> Honestly in all my 32 years of working in/on electronics I have never come across wire like this. The jacket is rated at 200˚C but it seems much higher. It doesn't shrink back or melt at all. It is very pliable and durable. But then somehow strips very very easily with a razor blade... The strands ARE tinned but STILL only clock-in @ 0.08mm. So 59 strands for 22AWG. And yet it still retains your 'Pre-Solder Twist'. I'm decidedly both impressed and confused.. Rant complete. Highly recommended",
      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★★ <b>High quality silicone wire, very high strand count</b> Good quality wire. VERY flexible, and the durometer of the silicone insulation is a little harder than other brands so it should hold up to abrasion better.",

      "B0BYNNJS8B ★★★★★ <b>Good Quality, High Temp Wire</b> I work on a lot of electronics requiring 12-gauge wire and recently procured this wire for a couple of my projects. I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful.",
      "B06Y58W228 ★★★★★ <b>Wire is as advertised, recommended</b> Advertised as 30 strands of 0.08mm. I counted 29, but could have missed one. My measured diameter is 0.079 - close enough. A word of caution - silicone insulation is NOT a high-strength material. This wire should not be used where it is subject to stress or vibration.",
      "B01KWBPC7M ★★★★★ <b>Very decent wire. In depth review & Pics</b> Running some permanent LED strips in the living room vaulted ceiling. Needed wire to run through the attic from the LED strips to a controller about 22 feet away. Wanted something heavier than the 22 gauge wire you find everywhere, and I wanted 100 foot spool Those two combinations limited what was out there. Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white). Even with my current strips, would have been nice to be able to upgrade without having to re-run wire. Oh well, happy anyway!",
      "B0CF55452S ★★★★☆ <b>Low voltage landscape copper wire</b> 16/2, 165ft - This is a competent product: labeling on the jacket says direct burial underground, and the insulation is relatively flexible at room temperature for stripping and bending. Stiffer in a colder outdoor environment. I did not measure the length to confirm advertised 165 ft though. Conductor appears to be pure copper strands, which is as claimed, not copper coated aluminum. The individual strands are quite fine. I counted 64 strands after stripping. Makes it very flexible and not likely to break after many and extreme bends. See photo. - Was easy to strip. - Actually the product seems fairly generic: there is no branding printed on the jacket nor any identification label on the roll. But you weren't expecting a mainstream brand anyhow, and it's just outdoor low voltage wire. It's fine. Looks like it will hold up in the garden. - One thing to keep in mind is that because it's bare copper wire (not tined, like marine wire) the connections are subject to corrosion from moisture and humidity. Make sure to use a connector method that either bonds the ends (solder) or creates a waterproof barrier to prevent this. - At the time I ordered the 16/2 165ft roll was $41, making it an okay deal, considering it's generic wire. - Hope this helps"

The only reason I don't give it five stars is, it came in bag, as just a coil of wire, without any spool or anything. Originally, I didn't think that would matter.

Romax is solid core wire so that means you need to not bend of the stuff Any more than necessary. Copper work hardens which means the more you bend it the more brittle it becomes, and then it breaks.

Well, decades later I am experienced and educated about thermostat wire cable. Very, very, rarely is the problem caused by bad thermostat wire cable itself. The thermostat wire problem is always caused by a person doing something wrong: stapling through the thermostat cable, shorting the conductors across a power transformer, crushing the thermostat wire cable between boards or vents, cutting the thermostat wire cable with a weed wacker, and etc.. Of course, I use a special staple gun that installs high arch staples that will not crush the thermostat wire cable. I run “loose” runs that can be “stretched” when necessary.

The 28 gauge let me put multiple wires into a single hole on my prototype boards, which cut down on creation time. It comes in its own box with draw-holes for each spindle. Low-tech, but it works well. It does not take up much desk space and it keeps the wires controllable as you use it. A good solution",
      "B0C5BLQ327 ★★★★★ <b>Very thick yellow jacket, high quality</b> If you've worked with typical romex before, you know how thin the jacket is. It can snag and tear pretty easily. That is sometimes a curse and a blessing. The blessing is when stripping the wires at the termination. Easier to cut and strip back the jacket. The jacket on this wire is at least 3x the thickness. I should have taken a picture to prove my point, but I am not exaggerating. 12awg solid core wire is pretty stiff anyways, but the added thickness of the jacket makes it even stiffer. Once again, a blessing and a curse. Thicker jacket, more protection, but it takes a bit more work to trim the jacket back. I suppose in bulk, the additional jacket thickness would contribute to the weight of the product as well, but it wasn't noticeable in the 25ft length I ordered. The 12awg wires stripped perfectly with my wire strippers without gauging the conductors.",

This is perfect for use in almost any decent kind of connectors and it is flexible enough to be durable and nice to work with. - Insulation on the individual strands is of very good quality and they are powdered so the outer insulation can be easily removed. - The wire is real copper, with tin plating and the tin plating is of very good quality. This resists corrosion and will carry electricity very well. - Packaging was very good and there are 3 twist ties around the roll of wire, holding it together and keeping it neat. Twist ties are very good because they are much easier to deal with than zip ties and they are reusable. Cons: - Outer insulation is PVC, which will likely become much stiffer in cold weather, but it appears to be good quality PVC, so maybe it won't be too bad. I can't tell right now because the weather here is not cold enough now. - Clearly labeled \"Made in China\". Overall: Excellent quality product.",

      "B0CV7XP7JN ★★★★★ <b>True Marine Grade Tinned Copper Wire</b> So I really wanted to find out what makes good wire. Turns out there’s a few factors when determining a quality wire. 1. Copper is better than aluminum, as (semi) precious metals such as silver, gold , platinum etc. are superior, however, cost prohibitive. 2.copper should be bright and 3. The wire jacket should not show any wear or distinguishable defect with the heat of a cigarette applied to it. Makes sense for scenarios when a fire may be present especially on motor vehicles. 3. Must exhibit moderate to good flexibility. 4.the shielding must be smooth throughout. If not, that means the wire has not been produced be acceptable standards. Unevenness of the wire core may create sliding within the shielding due to looseness created. In my testing this wire meets all these requirements with only a slight mark off for slight mark left after the cigarette test. I think that this is adequate wire for anyone’s build requiring 18 gauge marine grade wire. The tin coated copper is even and well applied. The copper is on the rigid side, however, acceptable for good quality in terms of flexibility. I don’t think you would be disappointed with choosing this, especially, if your other choice is cheaper copper clad aluminum.",

I putter around with offgrid solar power and battery setups, have several at home in addition to my grid-tied system and like to help friends set their own systems up as well. For that you really need some good heavy high-quality copper wire, because once you get the system down to 12 or 24v, you need to pull quite a few amps to power reasonable-sized inverters, and that means thick copper, and sometimes multiple strands of it. I create my own power cables using copper crimping ends, sometims with two parallel 4AWG lenghs used in parallel as a single cable, and kept as short as feasible. This cable works well for that. It’s reasonably flexible and seems to take the power just fine. I consider copper to be a precious metal; won’t be all that long until it costs a lot more than it does now, because the ore grades are falling inexorably around the world, it’s getting more energetically remote. So I think of owning spare high-quality copper wires as an investment for the future just like gold or silver, only a lot more useful and a lot cheaper. This is a good example of very useful copper cable, recommended to those setting up solar panels and inverters.",

Silicone coated, high strand count, thin stands, copper & tinned, HIGHLY flexible</b> Perfect high strand count, VERY flexible wire and confirmed it IS copper wire that's been tinned. If you're looking for that type of wire this is it, it's the good stuff. I love this kind of wire and use it a lot. I've got a new multimeter for home use, keeping the Fluke for my shop use, the test leads on this new meter has very stiff wires, love the meter but those wires got to go so I'll be using this for that meter and also with what's left to make some more jumper wires with the insulated alligator clips, those jumpers will be for the shop use, for auto repairs. Once you use this kind of wires you start looking for where you can use it to replaces the old stiff wire things LoL. Yeah, this is the good stuff, Yes I HIGHLY recommend it! Five Stars.",

It is really stiff and the wire ends break easily. The roll of wire is 20 gauge stranded copper wire. It bends easier, has a red and black sheathed conductors that are fused to each other, but easy to seperate when you need to work on the ends for connections. A soft, pliable wire coating. Worked very nicely for me.",

      "B0BPLQ3PWN ★★★★☆ <b>Pretty Standard Zip Cord</b> I ordered this to replace the buried wiring for my low voltage landscape lighting. The old wiring was sized to handle incandescent bulbs, which I have now replaced with LEDs. That wire was pretty stiff to begin with and has only gotten more so in the 45 years since it put it in. This wire looks like the usual zip cord, it is flexible, the insulation is fairly thick, and resistance measurement shows it to be consistent with 18 awg stranded copper wire. Barring rodent attacks, it should stand up well. It would also be fine for speaker wiring and, because It is actually rated for 300V, you can use as 110V lamp cord. However, be careful to stay within the current rating, which might make it chancy for many appliances. The description says that it is tinned copper; that’s obviously not true but also irrelevant. The price/foot is quite low reasonable so I’d recommend it.",

Dye on the silicone insulation (of both types of wire) is quality and it's nice and shiny and not \"faded\" looking hue wise. Cuts clean as well. Recommendable.",
      "B0BXT6SBZ4 ★★★★★ <b>Super soft and flexible.</b> This is some of the most flexible wire I have seen, and the silicone insulation is immune to soldering heat with no creeping or pull-back from the solder joint. The copper wire is pre-tinned and very easy to solder. I'll have to save this wire for the special high-flex applications and use the cheaper PVC elsewhere. The box serves as a dispenser that actually works because the wire is too soft to try to withdraw back into the exit holes as is often the case with PVC-insulated wire. There is some chemical odor coming from the insulation, or at least coming out of the box. I find it odd that silicone insulation would have an odor, so maybe it is coming from the spools or the cardboard. It's not a problem for me. I recommend keeping some of this wire on hand for some or all of your project needs.",
      "B01GZ50P7Q ★★★★★ <b>Quality cable and amazing shipping speed</b> The cable proved an unexpected challenge to locate and thankfully this vender had it. I've been looking for a quality shielded 4 conductor cable to be used in a HVAC data line application. This cable meets the bill and then some. The jacket is tough and protective of the 100% shield with a pure stranded copper drain wire. Each conductor is also pure copper and tightly twisted together. This cable is installed in a common cable ally with 24 runs of CAT6a data and multiple RG-8a medium RF power coax lines. No crosstalk whatsoever! I Highly recommend the vendor and this cable.",

      "B0CG1GSW3P ★★★★☆ <b>Good copper lines</b> Some nice set of color coded and gauged length of copper wire. The insulation is decently flexible and combined with the stranded copper wire makes it simple enough for running the wires The copper wire itself is low resistance with decent power handling capabilities and will have lower voltage drop compared to stock wires that come with things. With all this length I will be using this wire to replace and upgrade power supply cables, solar power terminals, jumpers, ebike power cables, and a couple other project items that have low quality and stiff wires.",

      "B09XQWWPD2 ★★★★★ <b>Real copper, flexible, solders and crimps well</b> I just used this wire in a Li-Ion battery project. I like how it is tinned, with a high strand count. Those qualities make it pliable and easy to solder. It is copper, not copper-plated aluminum, making it a better choice for conductivity reasons. It also has burly 105C 600V ratings. Highly recommended.",
      "B0C6TF37VS ★★★★★ <b>Very thick insulation</b> I like the thick insulation and it’s copper not aluminum so will maximize current carrying capacity for a 12 gauge wire. I am using it in my automotive projects for power lead in the engine bay for things like high power light bar and off road lights. It’s a bit difficult to strip the outer black cover but once done carefully and some heat shrink used properly makes a very nice professional looking cable installation that looks robust and worthy of a life under the hood.",
      "B0C84BL61V ★★★★★ <b>12 AWG copper</b> Width matches AWG standard as far as I measured. Scraping the wire exposed that the core is copper and that it is tinned as advertised. Very flexible and easy to manipulate with the silicone coating. I got the six pack and everything works as expected.",
      "B0CG9DWDK1 ★★★★★ <b>Top notch real fine stranded copper</b> I was a little wary ordering this not knowing if it was real copper at this price point. Most of these end up being CCA or just straight aluminum but this was exactly what i wanted. 12ga fine stranded aluminum usually goes for a much higher price but this was the real deal. The silicone is similar to what you find on a 2 carrier power wire but thicker. I'm using this for some 12vdc landscape lighting that's cut into my driveway and sealed with sikaflex with the rest trenched 12\" into my flower beds and then into my power supply. This is perfect for my application but could also be used for premium audio as well as 120vac. Overall, I highly recommend this product, it's definitely legit and can be used with a variety of applications. I would definitely recommend this wire and will probably be ordering more of it when I do my backyard.",

I've already put it to work running LED lighting on my truck. It's pretty stiff stuff (which I prefer) but bends without much force, much more burly than the cheap stranded wire. Insulation is good: there is the outer jacket with all wires inside, plastic around the wires, and each wire itself is insulated.",
      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★★☆ <b>Nice and pliable, nothing to suggest it's actually copper wire</b> Like several other reviewers I noticed the only markings on the silicone jacket was the size and temp rating but nothing to say it's actually O2 free or copper. It is definitely a silver color wire and I see no copper at all. Super small strands of wires so it should work well in a project that requires repetitive motion. Had I been able to get more that 15 feet I would have used it in the doors of my XJ to rebuild the wiring harness that has multiple breaks in it from opening and closing the doors.",
      "B0CRYX1P5T ★★★★★ <b>quality wire</b> This wire is just as advertised. It's super flexible. The tinned copper wire is easy to solder and doesn't oxidize, which is a good thing for my various car and trailer projects.

      "B0CN768S54 ★★★★★ <b>Good budget wire</b> I picked up the 20AWG 3, 4 and 5 conductor wire from this vendor. They are essentially the same, except for the number of conductors of course. The sheath is thick and pliable. I was able to easily strip it off with Klein Tool 11061 wire strippers (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CXKOEQ6). I found the insulation on the individual conductors to be a bit more stiff than other wire I’ve used recently. It stripped off easily using the 20AWG slot on my Klein Tools 11063W wire strippers. (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BC39YFQ). Using the sharp blade from my flush cutters, I was able to scrape away the tin and verify that the wire strands are indeed copper.

      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ <b>Real copper with a pvc insulation</b> I work on automatic drivegates and home automation so I go through a significant amount of wire. This multi carrier wire is professional grade and thick enough to include DC power and ground at any amperage across long runs. Solid copper is the best but basically impossible to use for most conditions. The next best option and most versatile is thick, multi strand copper, which is what this is. Thick enough for power and ground but thin enough to run in tight spaces and make turns. I've already used most of this roll on butt connectors, soldered joints and distribution blocks and the pvc insulation is strong enough for direct burial on low voltage landscape lighting. You can even use this for running a set of quality surround speakers to the other side of a room. Very good wire with a wide range of applications and even better price point. Highly recommend this stuff.",

Is very flexible and can handle heat if necessary. Eight different colors is great for identifying circuitry. The eight little spools of wire Come in A box with eight holes around the edges that theoretically would allow you to dispense the wire without opening the box. The box is designed so that the spools lay on their sides. Four wires come out of each side. This means you can't leave the box on the shelf and just pull out the wire you want. I would have preferred to see these spools organized on edge where all eight spools could be accessed from just one side of the box. Aside from the box, the wire itself is very good.",

The wire is flexible, stranded, copper (each strand is tinned) and should have no issues meeting the power and temperature specs. 10 gauge is far more than most people will need for most basic RV wiring, but if you aren't sure, check with an electrician. I added pictures of the strands, before and after applying high heat. Note, the end of the strands ball up, which is a trait of copper, not aluminum. The tinning is easily burned from the wire to show the copper core. This is good stuff, actually great, considering what I see as the price of around 34 bucks. I'm pleasantly surprised!",

      "B07Q5JXYCP ★★★★☆ <b>Wire is 5 stars, connectors get 3 stars.</b> There's not much to say about the wire other than it is your typical low voltage, outdoor rated, direct bury 14 gauge stranded copper wire. It is solid copper, and not plated like you'll get with lower priced wire. The price is at least 25% less than what you'll pay in a big box store. The connectors don't come with instructions although they are somewhat intuitive to install. Installation goes much easier if you attach the connector to the 14 gauge wire first by separating about 3\" of the two 14 gauge vconductors. Then unscrewing the larger size cap end of the connector. Underneath the cap you'll see a long metal pin. The pin will pierce the insulation of the wire when you screw the cap back on the connector. Once you have it attached to the 14 gauge wire unscrew the cap on the other end of the connector. This cap will have a small hole in which you insert the stripped end of whatever wire is coming from the light fixture you're trying to attach. Make sure you strip about a half an inch of insulation off that wire. I inserted this wire through the hole of the cap and then into the open end of the connector. They'll be a small metal rod sticking up and you want to press the wire in as far as it'll go and then screw the cap back on. If all went well the pressure of the cap will hold the wire inside the connector. I'm not sure about the weather resistance of the metal used inside this connector so I used some electrical corrosion prevention paste, which is a dark gray silicon based gel that is sold to help weatherproof outdoor electrical connections or when you're dealing with aluminum wiring. Hopefully the paste will make the connection more weather resistant. So far they've been out in the yard for a few months and I haven't had any issues.",

      "B0CG1GSW3P ★★★★★ <b>Excellent 10-Gauge Copper Wire</b> The headline on the webpage says 12-gauge, but it’s actually 10-gauge wire. Someone said it was aluminum core, but that is not true. It is TINNED COPPER which gives the color of aluminum unless you look at the cut end of the wire. Then, you can see it is definitely copper core. You could also measure its resistance. It measures 0.031 ohms resistance in 30’. That’s equivalent to 1.033 ohms per 1000’. The standard for resistance of 10-gauge copper wire is 1.018 ohms per 100’ @ 25° C. Aluminum wire (10-gauge) is 1.649 ohms @ 25° C. My reading was at 24° C. Therefore, it’s copper wire. This wire is extremely flexible because of its silicone insulation and the extremely fine wire strands that make up the wire core. That makes it easy to work with and very desirable. Amazon Vine sent this product to me for an honest unbiased review. Would I recommend it? Yes, I’m looking forward to using this wire to run power to my trailer’s winch.

They closely replicate the original cloth-covered power cords of the 1920s and '30s. The Rayon cover of this cord will fray when cut so you may want to do the following for best results when cutting and terminating the wire. before cutting the wire use a match or small heat gun to \"cook\" the rayon about 1.25 inches long. Cut the cord in the center of the melted area then use a good wite stripper to remove the insulation. Be sure to leave some of the melted rayon behind or the rayon will fray and make a mess. If the outer rayon does fray don't touch it, just hit it with a match or lighter flame and it will self seal as it melts. The rayon is thin so don't overdo it with the heat or it will melt holes in it.

It was harder than I expected (which is to say harder than other brands) to separate the two wires. I tried to pull it apart with my fingers but finally resorted to snipping the end with wire cutters to get the split started. Even after that, it was difficult to pull them apart enough to strip the ends. The wire is easy to strip. The wire is stranded copper and is very flexible. One of the strands has ridges down the side so it is easy to tell them apart when you get to the other end of the run. This is good wire and it will work perfectly for my application.",
      "B07GH7JHG9 ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Beware of Copper Clad Aluminum Wire!</b> When shopping for Cat5e or Cat6 network cables, make sure you are comparing apples to apples. One of the most common tactics of the “low cost leaders” is to use aluminum instead of copper wire. This can lead to network issues from using inferior materials to transmit the signal. Looking to cut costs, manufacturers started using aluminum wire dipped in a thin coating of copper. This technique created an aluminum core cable surrounded by a thin layer of copper. The performance and safety of CCA cables are radically different. In fact, aluminum network cables violate TIA and IEC standards for Cat5e and Cat6 cables. CCA cable has higher attenuation than pure copper cables. This results in a greater loss of data, as packets have to be re-transmitted. The more data that is re-transmitted, the slower your network performs. Plus, these problems are compounded by every foot of cable you use; the longer the cable, the worse the performance. CCA cables also have a 55% higher DC resistance. This increases the amount of energy that is transferred into heat and reduces the amount of power that can be transferred. This issue makes them unusable for power over Ethernet (PoE) devices like IP cameras and phones. These cut corners also affect installers because aluminum wire creates installation issues. Due to the lower tensile strength, aluminum cables can be damaged when being pulled. Single conductors can break, making the cable useless, or the whole cable can snap. Aluminum also has a lower bend radius than pure copper cables. This means you can’t bend it as much before it fails. In short, spend the extra money on solid core copper cable.",

This wire feels like regular lamp cord when working with it. It's easy to cut and strip cleanly, but the jacket is plenty sturdy and should hold up just fine to temperature swings and weather exposure. The PVC jacket does get fairly stiff in the cold, so maybe keep it in the house or put it in the sun before installation so it's easier to run the way you want.",

Both are 10 gauge OFC with silicone insulation. The other brand - a speaker wire, not temperature rated - melted (and you can see some tiny solder blobs on the resulting groove). The Bntechgo insulation did not melt and was a bit thicker. Add in the extra fine tinned stranding and you have a very substantial product in my opinion.

This iGreely 10awg 30ft cable is another great product. They have been my go-to for low voltage wire and cables for my solar setup and vehicles. I ran this cable under my gazebo, where I have a little solar setup. I usually go out there and do movie nights on my days off from work. This cable is 30 feet black and 30 feet red. Some brands advertise 30 feet, but later, you find out they meant 15 feet black and 15 feet red. I can confirm that the wire is copper and not just coated. The insulation feels durable. It is thick but still very easy to bend. This is great if you dont have a straight shot where you are running it. I have the cable running from my solar panel on the roof down to my solar controller. I haven't fully cut the cable to size yet because Im thinking of reconfiguring my setup. I may change some things around and wanted to keep some slack. I did cut off a few pieces to make some MC4 cables. This cable has been through storms, the sun, rain, etc... even through the bad weather, it has held up great. I have part of it just lying on the ground and unprotected, but it's holding up very well. I recommend iGreely products and will be purchasing more myself.",

The individual strands are also thin making it easy to connect to the lights. Nothing worse than thick strands that are difficult to work with and stab you in the finger as you try to wrap together. In my case I used the 12 ga line as the main power line and the 16 ga to the light. Probably didn't need to set it up that way but I have a nice heavy gauge main line if I want to add more lights or accessories.",
      "B09V56LTY5 ★★★★☆ <b>Good for repairing outdoor marker light cables, robust insulation, pure copper wire - not tinned</b> We have an extensive series of outdoor stairs and boardwalks that are lighted by LED marker lights every ten feet. The lights are powered by a low voltage cable under the walkways. Last Winter a mother fox made a temporary den for her cubs under one of the boardwalks. In the Spring we discovered that several of the marker lights wouldn't light up due to power cables that were chewed through by sharp little teeth. The foxes have moved on but we were faced with repairing the broken cable. That's why I got this cable. It's perfect for low voltage outdoor use. The outside jacket is thick and robust. It took a bit of careful cutting to strip it off without damaging the inside conductor wires. Once off, I noticed this isn't just a standard single channel insulator jacket. It actually has two channels -- one for each of the conductors. (See photo.) That's makes for very tightly insulated conductors that should provide enhanced protection in underground or very wet environments. When I stripped the two conductors, I noticed they are not tinned as stated in the product description. This may or may not be an issue for you. Tinned copper cable is easier to solder and also minimizes corrosion for non-soldered joints. I removed a star from an otherwise five star review due to this. Summary Comments If you don't need tinned copper cable for low voltage outdoor applications, this is a good choice. The insulation is robust and should hold up well in underground or wet environments. You get pure copper conductors that provide efficient electrical conductivity.",
      "B09V56LTY5 ★★★★★ <b>Good copper electrical wire in 16AWG</b> The wire is as described and perform well. Two (red and black) wires with its own PVC insulation and there is a PVC outer jacket covering both. Wires are copper (NOT lower conductivity grade Copper Clad Aluminium). I made an actual count and there are exactly 27 strands. The outer jacket can be stripped off with wire stripper at 14AWG, which really indicate the wire is even slightly bigger than 16AWG. Nice wire, with good conductivity and well made. Excellent for extension or versatile use.",

I strongly suggest using copper versus copper coated aluminum wire for any project that will be exposed to the elements. Aluminum wire disintegrates quickly if there is exposure to salt or electrolytic action. If the load requires 10 gauge wire, go with copper wire.",

      "B0CV7XP7JN ★★★★★ <b>Well made sheathed 3 conductor wire</b> This wire is as described in the product description. The tinned pure copper, and it really is, allows it to be used in many applications where it might see some humidity. The outer sheath is a nice thickness and molded tight to the three conductors , which will help prevent moisture intrusion. The insulation on the individual wires is on the thinner side, but again, the outer sheath toughens the whole bundle. The combination, along with the 27 tinned copper filaments in each wire, allows the wire to be fairly flexible.

For me, that's a great selling point and one of the reasons that I ordered this coil of wire. The short version of this review can be summed up in one word: perfect. The outer insulation of this wire strips easily with either a romex stripping tool or (shudder) a sharp knife. The individual conductors’ insulation can be removed almost as easily as it’s not bonded to the surface of the copper conductor. Thankfully the conductors themselves are solid copper wire and not copper clad aluminum otherwise known as CCA. And for a bit more icing on the cake, this coil of Arizona Electrical Solutions wire costs less than half of what the same length coil of wire in the big box stores near me costs.

I was surprised to see it was supposed to be over 1000 strand count for this size wire and I did not count the strands but there are definitely more than any wire this size I have ever seen. It is very flexible which was great because I had to pull it under the floor and through obstacles including through 3 walls to install it. I had changed my RV refrigerator over to a 12 volt compressor and due to a 30 foot run the wire I had with so few strands and smaller gauge had too much voltage loss to run the fridge well. This wire made an immediate difference and does not lose the voltage and carry amps load far greater than what I will ever need but it is nice to have more than less capability.

      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Interesting wire if you never worked with it before, very little voltage drop..</b> I read some reviews before ordering this, so I was aware that this was not your typical multi-strand copper wire that is used in automotive and industrial applications for low DC voltage. I needed 12 gauge wire for a project, and thought I would give this a try. A 20 ft run of this wire supplying 14.3 volts DC with a constant load of 25 amps showed only .15 volts of voltage drop. Comparable multi-strand copper wire in another circuit of the same wire length and specifications was showing a .21 voltage drop. Yes, there could be other items in play that I am not accounting for, but this is just merely indicating that this wire type is not any WORSE of a conductor than what you would normally purchase at the parts store to repair wiring on your vehicle. The added flexibility of the wire seems to be a plus, especially since I was wiring in some off-road lights when it was 15 deg F outside.

This has 30 feet of parallel joined jacket R&B conductors using tinned copper stranded wire rated for up to 300 Volts. I'm using it for no more than 48 Volts DC so this will do just fine. Stranded wire is more flexible and less prone to fatigue breakage. I do wish this had the more modern silicone insulating jacket which has better flexibility and resistance to oil. It is more costly. I stripped an end to show the tinned strands and scraped off some tinning to show the true copper conductor core, not Copper Clad Aluminum (CCA) which is cheaper.

      "B07ZQNC71B ★★★★★ <b>It’s Romex, Just Different Branding</b> Worked great for a Bryant NEMA 14-50 for my 220V garage “appliances”. Got 6/3 wire for future proofing. Pain in the royal tookus to smash into the deepest metal box with a stand-off plaster faceplate but it became a lot easier when I pulled the wire through a bit and worked on wiring the plug with slack and cutting each wire to a specific length from the 3/4 connector so the wire didn’t have to bend when mounting the plug. Then I just fed back the extra wire until the plug was mounted. Gotta plan accordingly so you retain the wire sheathing at the connector if you do it that way. Finally had a use for my hex sockets when torquing these. Highly recommend mounting it in the box and pulling the plug back out and retorquing because I did that by chance and found I could get a little bit more tight in the connections. 6/3 wire is no joke.

The wire is flexible, stranded, copper (each strand is tinned) and should have no issues meeting the power and temperature specs. 10 gauge is far more than most people will need for most basic RV wiring, but if you aren't sure, check with an electrician. I added pictures of the strands, before and after applying high heat. Note, the end of the strands ball up, which is a trait of copper, not aluminum. The tinning is easily burned from the wire to show the copper core. This is good stuff, actually great, considering what I see as the price of around 34 bucks. I'm pleasantly surprised!",

Each strand is pre-tinned so even 12-gauge wire is extremely flexible. I use a lot of crimp lugs in my work and this wire is great for what I do. I really like that I don't have to spend the time tinning now. I create industrial art pieces and often need very flexible wire. I'll include a picture of one of my unfinished pieces. I couldn't be happier with this wire. If any of them ever fail over time, I'll come back and update this post.",
      "B0C2HS6QG5 ★★★★★ <b>Low Resistance Good Sheathing</b> I pulled out my trusty multimeter to test the wire. I was able to get a resistance reading of 0.1 ohm on both the red and black wires which is awesome. Yay! My quick video shows the outer sheath came off easily without issue. It looks like this is about the largest size wire that I can fit into my cheap solar panel controller. I only wish I had gotten twice as much.",

      "B085Z8KVBT ★★★★★ <b>So much better than wire nuts!</b> I love these and was so glad to find they make them for 10 AWG",
      "B0CPPWBGT8 ★★★★★ <b>Tinned copper 14 AWG conductors. Sheathing smooth and easy to pull.</b> This seems like good wire for outdoor and automotive applications. The stranded copper conductors are tinned, and the ends already have a dab of solder. I'll be using heat shrink crimp connectors, so trimmed off the soldered tips. The PVC sheathing on this wire is smooth and I was able to easily pull it through a conduit to replace an old wire with just some electrical tape joining the ends. Tested with a light drawing 2 amps, and only detected a .3V voltage drop across the entire 50 foot coil. Sold as 12V low voltage wire, but rated for 300V. I like that this wire is rated for direct burial and waterproof, so long as it remains undamaged. It's easy enough to slide this through some conduit or at least sections of old garden hose or something to make it more durable and resist chafing. The PVC sleeve is somewhat loose and the individual wires can be removed from short sections fairly easily. Not very flexible, but easy enough to bend. The price point is typical for similar products, but I see a 20% discount is currently offered, making it a good bargain for a good product.",

      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★★ <b>Looks really good. Real tinned copper. Very slinky</b> There's not a whole lot to say about this wire that hasn't been said in other reviews already. I ordered the 12 awg with 10 feet of each red and black. I was just trying to round out my stock a bit as I already had some 10, 14 and 16 awg silicone wire around. I tend to order BNTechGo as I tried them once and was plenty happy with it. This stuff seems just as good as far as I can tell. My main concern was if it was real tinned copper or not so I stripped a section and scraped it with a sharp knife until I could clearly see the copper start showing through the tin. So yes, this is definitely real copper. The strands are extremely fine, which is great for flexibility but can make it tough to strip without cutting some. But that's the case with all flexible silicone wire, so no real issue there compared to other brands. These 10' sections came in just loose coils in a resealable pouch, which I guess is fine given how short they are; normally I prefer spools. All in all this wire seems just as good as other more established brands and costs less. Works for me.",
      "B0002YWVCE ★★★★★ <b>10/2 romex</b> Arrived just as expected.",
      "B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★☆ <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again).",
      "B07M98MYML ★★★★★ <b>Finally found it!</b> I’ve been on the lookout for 10 AWG solid core at my local home centers for months now, but all I can ever seem to find is stranded core - very difficult to tighten under a grounding screw at the lower gauges. Considering the apparent supply shortage for this item, I was a little nervous that the claimed solid core specification might be an error. But my fears turned out to be unfounded. It was exactly what I needed, in the right quantity, at a great price. I received the product within two days of ordering. Completely satisfied, and I will gladly do business with this vendor again.",

      "B07111R7N8 ★★★★★ <b>FOR CAR AUDIO PEOPLE…</b> I was looking for copper tinned lugs for my car audio build. I usually buy my lugs directly from sky high car audio, but I was in a bit of a money pinch so $10 for a pack of 10 didn’t seem that worth it at the time. I ended up coming across these bad boys, which happened to be the best deal around. 50 lugs for less than $40. Honestly I was pretty hyped. I ended up remember that car audio 1/0 is not standard 1/0 welding wire. It’s actually oversized 1/0…so right in between 1/0-2/0. I decided to go for the 2/0 lugs and purchased 50 of them. I tested it out on 1/0 sky high wire and it fit like a GLOVE. The 2/0 lug itself is smaller than sky high 1/0 lug, which was kinda nice because I am working on tight space. I did try the 2/0 lug on some sky high 2/0 and there’s no chance it would go in. Maybe if you force a ton, but even then it won’t work. I couldn’t even get the head of the wire in and these lugs are flared outwards too. I haven’t crimped them yet but I will soon, I’ll update the review when I get to crimping stage. But as of now, they get a 5/5 for fitting oversized 1/0 car audio wire. Update 3/6/22: crimping is absolutely awesome. I have two types of crimpers, hydraulics and handheld $30 crimpers from amazon. I decided to use the handheld crimper, even though it doesn't go up to 2/0 size. Stuck it on the 1/0 setting and did 2 crimps at the bottom and top of the lug. Had my dad pull one end of the wire while I held the lug end of the wire. We both pulled as hard as we could and it didn't even move. I'd say they work as intended.",

      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★☆☆ <b>There are no ratings, UL or otherwise, on this cable</b> Ok, so I guess it really depends on what you are doing as to how happy you are going to be with this cable. If you are doing nothing more than running speaker wire, then good for you. You should be happy with the cable. If you are running power wire for an appliance, a solar system, or for any standard project other than low voltage battery, you will have to pause and wonder. What is the voltage rating? What is the current rating? Is this really OFC or something else? You can think it is something, but you will NOT know for sure. If you have an inspector ask for the ratings, you are out of luck and will have to rewire your project. The company says that it is 10 GA Oxygen free copper and they say the rating on the insulation is 200V. So, the problems start when you look at Silicon insulation and find that the normal low voltage rating is 600V up to 35,000V. 200V does not appear in any standard. Most oxygen free tinned copper still looks like copper when you cut it. This cable does not do that, even with a magnifying glass. So, how do you know? Nothing on the cable indicates that it is OFC or anything other than 10GA. Ok, once you get that resolved in your mind, this cable is designed like lamp zip cord except it splits way too easily. Great concept, but you will need to secure the cable ends somehow if you do not want it pulling apart. You can use electrical tape, shrink tubing, or even a tie wrap not pulled too tight. The cable itself is very flexible, like you would expect from a silicon wire. For use in a solar system where there is NO ground and you are required to install a breaker on both the negative and the positive side of the supply, this type of cable works very well. In fact, it is the project I started using it on until the Building inspector asked to see the data sheet on the wire or at least the UL number. Since I could not produce it, I had to remove what I had done and switch to a UL rated cable. Does that make this a bad product? No, it only makes it a quesitonable product since you do not know exactly what you have. I have not been able to find a way to directly contact the company to ask for a spec sheet. I just hope they watch the reviews and can provide the requested item, then this would be a product I would recommend. Until then, I cannot recommend it.",
      "B0BWWW6PJK ★★★★☆ <b>Nicely made cable that has the described wires with a good coating for protection and a ground wire.</b> The 6/3 6 AWG Power Cable by Arizona Electrical Solutions, is a very nice cable that’s heavy duty coated to protect and ready for install. It looks to be as described with all copper wires and is made of good quality materials that lead me to believe it should serve me very well and last a long time. It comes with seemingly durable insolation around each wire and more around the whole cable, making it a great outdoor or industrial cable for many things. Each 6 AWG wire is made up of 7 smaller copper wires wrapped in a plastic type coating.

      "B0B5DSNSFX ★★★★☆ <b>Perfect for 12V projects and sound systems</b> Straight out of the box both spools of wires are exactly as described. The insulation is thick, still flexible enough to work with. I used it on a 24V Solar power project and on a car sound system; it worked perfectly on both projects. The insulation looks and feels more “rubberized” than “hard plastic”, which gives the wire the flexibility needed, specifically for when you have to run the wire through panels, and it helps routing too, it looks more neat and easier to secure it. For the price listed, and for the specifications being accurate, I think this product is a good purchase.",
      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★★ <b>A pleasure to work with</b> This was a great quality wire! They have such a great feel and flexibility despite the insulation being a bit thicker. It's tinned copper with a high fine strand count. I had been using 1/4 wire loom with the PVC insulated 12 gauge wire but I did have to go buy 3/8 wire loom for these pair of 12 gauge wires, so it's a little bit thinker than your standard stranded wire. The silicone insulation and over all flexibility made it easy to slip the wires into the loom. Unfortunately I discovered this wire at the end of my electrical install job on my trailer, but I will use it on upcoming projects going forward!",
      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★☆ <b>Slippery like a ramen noodle</b> > Dastard Ultra Flexible 12 Gauge Silicone Wire, Red & Black Each 10ft The Good: Very flexible. Listing does not deceive by listing two 10ft wires as 20ft of cable (some other listings are deceptive that way, as it shows up as half the cost per foot). Also, hilariously cool brand name. The Bad: Nothing. These are good cables if they fit your needs. I suggest ferrules or tinning the ends. The stranded wires are extremely thin. Tinning is easy, but takes a little flux and a LOT of solder because the tiny strands soak it up so fast. These wires will take solder, no problem at all. Jacket does not melt, so make sure you add enough heat for solder to penetrate.",

It is tinned copper, as evident by two facts: the ends of the strands are red when cut, and it takes solder very easily. This is exactly what you want, as fine stranded bare copper would corrode too easily. The jacket is definitely a good quality high temp silicone, and is on the thicker side for silicone wire. I prefer this, as silicone jackets generally tear easily if they are too thin. The wire gauge is at least true to size. I haven't stripped and weighed it, but it fits snugly in my 10AWG crimp terminals. The only way this could possibly be made better is if the wire was made from 7 bunches of twisted strands, with the combined cable twisted the other direction. This improves flexibility and keeps strands together after stripping.",

Red is mainly used for the hot wire to the input and black is used for ground throughout the guitar. One thing I like about this wire is the red and black are fused together but can easily be separated. It means you can run a short length of about 18 without a messy tangle of wire, separate the ends where they solder to the tabs. The wires are pre-tinned, so once you remove ¼ inch of the sleeve, you can solder directly without taking more time fiddling and tinning yourself.

They do advertise it as CCA, copper clad aluminum, and I unfortunately verified that by cutting into the wire when stripping it. However it is advertised as 10 gauge (they are very adamant that this wire does not conform to AWG spec and will not advertise it as AWG), but it fits perfectly into a 12ga/AWG ferrule. I looked around reviews both for this one and the 12gauge variant and all around I saw that the 12ga wire that they sell is actually more like 14ga/AWG size and the 10ga size is more like 12ga/AWG size. The outer diameter is probably 10ga but the inner is for sure very close to 12AWG. Pure copper for the same length would be like 2-4x the price, but a safe assumption would be that CCA holds 80% of pure copper amperage (since aluminum has 70% of the conductance of copper, but I add in roughly 10% cause there is a copper layer on top). Say if 10AWG pure copper holds 30 amps between 12-80V DC, then CCA wire of the same cross directional size would probably safely hold ~24 amps or less (<21 amps) if you hold CCA wire as the same conductance as pure aluminum and believe the copper layer is just for show.

I did however use shrink wrap connectors and noticed that the insulation has a low melting point, so some melting occurred when applying heat to shrink the tubing, using a heat gun. I would not use a flame or torch as a heat source, but with a heat gun you can get it hot without melting insulation. All in all, well made and perfect for hobbyists.",

The copper stains are too thin to work-with, they are brittle to bend around a connection screw. Soldering is required to support the stains.

This wire has much less current carrying capacity and if a buyer uses it expecting the current carrying capacity of an 18 AWG wire a serious over heat/fire could be the result.

The industry standard for 10 gauge wire with 105 strands is 0.116\", and what I received is 0.102\", which is the industry standard for 12 gauge wire! So, one dare not try to use this 12 gauge wire for 25 to 30 amp applications suited for TRUE 10 gauge wire without running the risk of violating the physics of what I received.

This kit gave me most of what I needed. The conductor is nicely flexible and looks to be of good quality, a tin-coated, very fine braid. However it runs smaller than the gauge indicates, and you need to dig into the specs to see this. For comparison, the DXC uses 0.75mm^2 wire, which is equivalent between 20 and 22 ga, or the same size as this wire's \"18 gauge.\" A second issue is with the soft silicone installation.

      "B0CN9FNFZC ★★★☆☆ <b>Handy multi-conductor cable; probably not quite 18ga?</b> As the title says, this multi-conductor cable will come in handy for a number of my DIY projects. Since some of those may involve something on my boat, having tinned conductors is a real plus -- it does help prevent corrosion of the copper, and you can see the tinned strands in one of my included photos. My one issue with this product is the claim that the conductors are 18 gauge. Granted, I don't plan to use this anywhere that I'll be pushing the limits of an 18ga wire, but I did want at least to test the claims. I don't have a great way of measuring the diameter of the wire, especially with twisted strands. This is technically what the wire gauge means. However, a wire's resistance is a function of its cross-sectional area, and there are numerous free online calculators to let you determine what the resistance of a certain gauge of wire should be for a given length of wire. Here's what you do: Search for wire resistance calculator Enter 18 gauge and 50 ft You get 0.319 ohms Measure the resistance of one conductor for the entire 50' spool Compare your resistance reading to what it should be As shown, I used the red conductor (they should all be the same) and I got between 0.38 and 0.40 ohms. Since the resistance is higher than it should be for 18 gauge, I can know with reasonable certainty that the wire is smaller than 18 gauge. In fact, a 19 gauge wire (uncommon in the US) should be right at 0.403 ohms for 50' of wire. This all may not sound like much, but the resistance is over 22% higher than it should be for 18ga, which means that you're getting 22% less copper than you're expecting. All that's to say that this product seems fine, and as long as you're not depending on the full conductivity of a true 18 gauge wire, you'll be good. However, I tend to score products pretty harshly when they make claims that they can't hold up to, and sadly that's the case with this cable. Buy it and use it, eyes wide open, or buy something else if you need a true 18 gauge wire.",

      "B0BZTW2XMN ★★★★★ <b>Good wire</b> This cable seems identical to the similar item from the box store but at a better price. For LED lighting 14 GA is sufficient for most applications. I use it to extend the short pigtail that's on most lamps back to the main feeder which I place where it won't be in the way and is protected. It seems to be good quality, although I can't totally say that until its been exposed to sunlight and weather for a couple of years. But I'm pretty sure it's the same as other similar wire I've used in the past.",
      "B0C63QKZ55 ★★★★★ <b>Good quality wire</b> If you have an old house like I do, you are constantly repairing and replacing things that have just ran their lifespan, and outlets are one of those. The people who built my house put GFICI outlets on the back of the house around the pool area and time, and the second owners, have taken their toll on them. For whatever reason, so were taken out by ripping the plastic conduit off the boxes and the wires just cut off. How it ever passed home inspection is beyond me, but being the electrician that I am, I have been working on replacing them. Since I was already in the process, I decided to use this wire since it should cover the code requirements for the outlets. I pulled out the old wire from the subpanel (with the power off, off course). Being in Florida, the old wire was about 50 years old and crusty with the humidity and having had various creatures in there over the years. This wire was fully pliable at 14 gauge, and I had no issues pulling in through the bungs and watertight fittings I had added. I'm a fan of flexible conduit and 14 gauge is much easier to pull through it than 12, but make sure you know your local code requirements (or have a licensed electrician do the work) if you are doing this. I have wired three outlets with this wire and haven't found any issues with it. I found it to be easily workable, strips like I would expect it to, and didn't find any flaws in it. I can't see any fault with recommending this wire for your 14/2 wiring jobs.",

I ran this cable under my gazebo, where I have a little solar setup. I usually go out there and do movie nights on my days off from work. This cable is 30 feet black and 30 feet red. Some brands advertise 30 feet, but later, you find out they meant 15 feet black and 15 feet red. I can confirm that the wire is copper and not just coated. The insulation feels durable. It is thick but still very easy to bend. This is great if you dont have a straight shot where you are running it. I have the cable running from my solar panel on the roof down to my solar controller. I haven't fully cut the cable to size yet because Im thinking of reconfiguring my setup. I may change some things around and wanted to keep some slack. I did cut off a few pieces to make some MC4 cables. This cable has been through storms, the sun, rain, etc... even through the bad weather, it has held up great.

      "B00KHIZR80 ★★★★★ <b>Good for using as hoops to hold up row cover in a garden</b> I bought this to use to make hoops to hold up my row cover on my garden beds. I didn't want to go the PVC route and wanted something that didn't take up much room when I store it and this fits the bill. I just tied the bunch together and hang it on the fence when not in use. I but two rolls of it and that was good because you use it up fast because it's thick. I think I got maybe a dozen hoops 3 ft high out of a roll, maybe a little more. That corresponds to probably each piece 8 or so feet long when you count the foot they're in the ground on each side. It's strong enough that I can stick it straight in the ground a foot and it will maintain its shape. A lighter gauge I'd probably have to put a metal or PVC tube of some kind in the ground and put the wire inside the tube. One caveat: given the thickness of this gauge I had to buy a special cutter for it. This cutter just barely does the job but for the amount I need to use it I wasn't going to pay more than $10 - $12 for a$30 cutter that would go through it like butter. Don't think you're going to cut this with tin snips or dikes because you aren't. I might have gone one gauge lighter and it would have been easier to cut but I'm not sure it would hold up the row cover as well as it does. I'm using a hoop about every 2 1/2 to 3 ft. I will buy it again.",

It's acceptable but not great. 4 STAR - I am very comfortable recommending it to a friend because it is is well made, durable, and delivers on its advertised features, and I would buy it again. 5 STAR - I really love it. The item exceeds my expectations of quality, durability and functionality. Not only would I purchase it again, but I would also actively encourage friends and family to to do the same.

The Higoom wire is particularly easy to handle, far easier to use in tight spaces than stiffer wires, and the tinned copper core makes it very simple to solder, too. Having six colors to choose from to match the color of a splice or repair in car or trailer wiring, along with the included short lengths of shrink tubing, means that 12-volt system repairs can be nearly invisible. The perforated dispensing box is a nice touch for anyone who does such work at a single work station, though I don't think I'll be using that feature. A really handy set of 16-gauge wire, and one that should last me a long time.",
      "B07NPJB5W8 ★★★★☆ <b>Seems to be 18GA</b> Comparing it to some real 18AWG wire it does seem to be 18. Althought it might be a tad smaller, but it could also be because of the finer strands vs the thick stands on the wire i was comparing it to. But it looks 18GA to me.

      "B0B5DTDN64 ★★★★★ <b>22 Gauge CCA Wire Is A No Brainer For Non Mission Critical Low Voltage Projects.</b> This review is on the 22 Gauge Wire Combo 6 Pack 12V 100'FT per Roll (600 ft Total) CCA wire. Cost is always a consideration when working on projects. What is CCA wire? It’s a copper cladded aluminum wire, meaning that the outer layer is coated with copper while the inner core is aluminum. How does CCA work? The copper clad aluminum isn’t going to have the same conductive or durable performance as a pure copper, but it is pretty good. What’s to like? For non mission critical projects, the advantage of a CCA wire is cost as it is less than the cost of pure copper. What’s not to like? It’s not as durable and it has a higher resistance than pure copper. In conclusion, if you’re working on lots of non mission critical low voltage projects, the CCA wires can be a great cost saving while still getting decent performance. That said, I’m giving this product 5 stars.",

      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★★ <b>Good Value Wire Set For DIYers</b> This is a pretty good 18AWG wire set. You get 8 colors, 50ft each, of silicone insulated wire. I've never used silicone insulated wire before, but I'm really liking how flexable and easy to strip it is. I also understand that it can withstand higher temperatures that standard PVC wire. The actual wire itself appears to be of some good quality and is tinned copper. Which will be nice for soldering. A couple of the colors are a little off from what you would normally expect, but they are still close enough and easy to tell apart. The box has holes for easy dispensing of the wire and to keep it from unrolling everywhere. In the kit you also get a good assortment of colored heat shrink tubing and small zip ties so you can color match and make everything look all spiffy. The little wire stripper it comes with is actually pretty good and strips quite well. I like it because it is a great size to put in a compact tool kit like for a motorcycle, boat, car, or whatever you want. If you are like me and do a lot of DIY projects then this kit is a great thing to have on hand. I actually plan to get the 10AWG kit also for higher current projects.

But also because most people opt for 1/0 gauge instead of 1 AWG so there are far more 1/0 stuff out there than regular 1AWG. My only reason for getting the 50 pack for 1AWG was because I got about 30ft of it for free (leftovers from another guy's project), and because the 50 pack meets the better value for amount of $/terminal without paying the price of the 100 pack. Could have went with a 10 or 25 pack, but those have far worse $/terminal. If I mess up some, I still will have about 30+ left, but it's unlikely. There are no other companies that make this specific size with this amount of quality and at an optimal $/terminal, even the chinese made ones. In fact, the worse quality chinese ones are more expensive than these that are made in the US, and I haven't seen any in 1AWG that are under $0.70/terminal and with no complaints of \"copper is too thin, so breaks easily.\" You can easily spend over 2 hours looking for some decent quality, cheap lug terminals, but this company is the only one that does it (assuming that you buy in 50/100 pack). Sometimes you come across funny reviews that buy 4/0 lugs for 4AWG cables. Heck even if you don't buy a 50/100 pack the quality of these dominate the majority of lug terminals out there. Didn't know you could just order directly from their site, but there's a small discount if you do cause of the amazon seller fee.",

I first lit up my landscape back in the high wattage halogen era, so I have previously used 12 AWG cable and multiple transformers to light limited areas. With the affordable availability of high efficiency LED landscape lights, the need for 12 gauge cable is no longer there, unless the runs are extremely long. When the fixtures were pulling 20 to 50 watts, options were limited. The 2 to 12 watt LED fixtures I am installing currently are working with this 18/2 cable, so there is no need for 12 gauge overkill, unless you are concerned with voltage drop over 50-100 feet runs.",
      "B0CG1GSW3P ★★★★★ <b>Great value</b> As with any inexpensive cable or wire, the concern is copper coated aluminum used instead of all copper or copper tined wire regardless of what the advertised description states. I was relieved to cut into this and see that it is in fact solid copper. Gauge seems correct and the jacket is solid, if not somewhat more rigid than I’d like to see. This will be used as a main 12v feed to a junction box in my camp trailer for exterior auxiliary lighting. While this isn’t and shouldn’t be confused with oxygen free, marine grade wire, it will serve its purpose just fine in my application. For whatever it’s worth, welding cable/wire is also not marine grade as it is heat resistant but not petroleum resistant. It is a step up from general use cable/wire though.",

      "B0D2LVRXBC ★★★★★ <b>Just a note</b> Its wire, not much to review, I just wanted to mention a note to other buyers or my future self. No fault to the seller or product, Amazon had the “order this + this + this” option for the end connectors and clamps, which you’ll also need, but it gives you a wrong size for the end clamps. The 3/4” mounting straps are the right size, but 3/4” ends to secure this 6/3 MC cable to your metal boxes is way to big. I ended up having to make a trip to the hardware store to buy smaller 1/2” end clamps instead of the 3/4” ones Amazon was recommending. I love working with MC cable, but its always a pain trying to determine the correct size anti short bushings, end caps, mounting straps etc to go with it. The sizes are all over the place depending on the gauge and number of wires and none of the sellers actually specify what size additional parts are needed to match up with it. As a side note, its also always confusing how sometimes it’ll state (for example) “6/3 wire” where you’d expect it to be three #6 wires total but in reality there are 4 wires, black, red, white and green. There isn’t always consistency in this, sure would be a lot easier if the standard was to count the actual number of wires, including the ground. This 6/3 MC cable in particular is actually four total 6 AWG wires, black, red, white, green for those that aren’t sure. It’s also rated for up to 55 Amps, which is perfect for wiring in a 50 amp RV, Dryer, or Oven outlet. Even if say your dryer outlet only requires 2 hots and a ground (6/2) with no neutral (old style), go ahead and run this (6/3) wire anyhow and just don’t use the extra wire, you’ll be doing yourself a future proof favor for the day when you replace that old appliance and discover the new one requires all 4 wires. Easier, and cheaper to just not use the extra wire now than trying to add another wire later.",

There are however, 2 layers of insulation to the cable: color coded (red and black) insulators on each conductor and a thicker protective insulator on the exterior. The wire gauge is quite light at #18, so it is especially good for LED lights which don't draw much current. I would also feel comfortable using it on a single halogen fixture at 20 watts or less. Overall the thin profile of the cable lends itself to being able to tuck it away easily and out of sight. I will likely be using it under a deck to power LV light fixtures.",

I putter around with offgrid solar power and battery setups, have several at home in addition to my grid-tied system and like to help friends set their own systems up as well. For that you really need some good heavy high-quality copper wire, because once you get the system down to 12 or 24v, you need to pull quite a few amps to power reasonable-sized inverters, and that means thick copper, and sometimes multiple strands of it. I create my own power cables using copper crimping ends, sometims with two parallel 4AWG lenghs used in parallel as a single cable, and kept as short as feasible. This cable works well for that. It’s reasonably flexible and seems to take the power just fine. I consider copper to be a precious metal; won’t be all that long until it costs a lot more than it does now, because the ore grades are falling inexorably around the world, it’s getting more energetically remote. So I think of owning spare high-quality copper wires as an investment for the future just like gold or silver, only a lot more useful and a lot cheaper.

      "B0CKTBGCXV ★★★★★ <b>Works</b> Somebody online said that for long runs you should use 14 rather than 12 gauge wire. I have tried both and maybe my runs were too short to notice, but either seemed to work. These are thick connected wire meshes of copper super-thin wires. The red and black are easily parted by intentional effort, but stuck well enough that you won't lose integrity on accident. It worked for me on an old Yamaha sound system and I used the rest for hanging pictures and a pinata.",
      "B07CHTXZYW ★★★★★ <b>Good value, I am pleased with it</b> It is very thin wire; 36 gauge wire is five-thousandths of an inch in diameter. The wire is bright and shiny and I feel no pits when I pull it through my fingers. I stretched about 6 inches between the alligator clips of a lab power supply set at 12 volts. It pulled about 900ma which means for that length of wire (eye-balled not measured) resistance is about 13 ohms. It glowed bright red. Note that wire increases in resistance as it is heated so this measurement will be higher than with an ohmmeter. I wrapped it around a pair of needle-nose pliers and pulled until it gave way. It required a few pounds of tension. Easily strong enough to use to cut Styrofoam, my opinion. I don't think copper will like the heat of a direct connection. For cutting Styrofoam, I think I would wrap it around a small length of steel wire and then push it through a steel butt connector and clamp it tight. Then attach the copper wire to the steel wire.",

      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>What's not to like?</b> When I placed my order for this I got a warning that this is a \"frequently returned item\" but I clicked BUY anyway and crossed my fingers. What showed up was six spools of 10' each 12ga silicone insulated wire in varying colors. Nothing to be mad at there... During my work I used a couple different wire strippers to remove insulation and had no issues, telling me the wire is truly 12ga. The individual strands are quite fine, which can make crimping a minor pain but it does make for super flexible wire, which is what I needed. The silicone insulation is probably not suitable for use in, say, an engine bay, but is very convenient for applications in a more protected environment. Got what I needed to done with no hassles, and I'm left wondering what's not to like?",
      "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★☆ <b>Stiff</b> It was not very cold the day this arrived, about 65゜F so I gave it a quick flex test. And it was pretty much a fail. The outer casing is more or less a sleeve and not form fit tight. Kind of like indoor romax house wiring only a little thicker. Getting a clean straight installation will be difficult without using multipal hangers. Probably a good thing to do would be wait for a hot sunny day to stretch it out and let lay in the sun for a while. I will be using this in a marine environment so, it coming pre-tinned is good, as I will be soldering all my lugs on. My wire gauge shows that it is actual 16 gauge wire. It will do the job I want it to. I will just have to work with it a little more to get a nice, clean looking install.",

Overall, nice high quality wire.",
      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★☆ <b>Silicone-esque wire, extremely fine, tinned as well</b> I purchased this wire to supplement several medium-sized wiring projects on our boat. Most of the use of this will require terminations to ferrules and will be more like jumpers between landings and switches with higher current requirements. Understand that heat shrink tubing historically does not adhere well to silicone wire. Like the 14AWG stuff, I seriously doubt this is pure silicone. Pure silicone is almost so rubbery that it has zero memory. This is good, but not the best I've felt. The wire itself is 12AWG, and is exceptionally fine. I'm removing one star due to the lack of information on the insulating jacket as well as what I'm sure is not a pure silicone insulation.",

      "B0CV7XP7JN ★★★★★ <b>3 Flavors - Taste the Same to Me</b> I like this wire. I like this companies products. I've now ordered this 16 Gauge, UL 2464 Tinned Copper Stranded Wire for LED Lighting in 3 different flavors. I got the 3 wire / conductor, the 5 wire, and now the 4 wire. The 5 wire is great for LEDs with a DC dimmer (AC - hot, neutral, ground & DC positive, negative for my dimmer switch). Boom! all done 1 cable. I got this 4 wire for my third LED high bay; I already had an available ground in the rafters next to the fixture. I ran the cable down and 2 AC wires (hot to toggle switch, neutral to neutral) & 2 wires for DC dimmer. Done. The 3 wire I used for my first High Bay - I had another two wire cable for the DC dimmer. I had to zip-tie those two together. This 3 wire cable is all you need for a non-dimmable LED or an LED fixture that uses AC dimmer technology. The wire is - nice supple / pliable PVC insulated 1/4\" outside diameter 16 gauge tinned copper. The Engineering Tool Box specs this wire at 6 amp carrying capacity up to 1000v @ 30 deg. C (86 F) ambient temperature. There is a .71 correction factor for temperatures between 41 - 45 deg. C (105 - 113 deg. F) So: 6(amps) x .71 = 4.26 4.26 amps is enough amperage for (3) 150w LED lamps. I'm using each cable for one fixture – I prefer to have the amperage up there for additions and the extra cost is minimal. I don't mind the extra cost for the marine rated tinned copper, but this company sells the same cable in the non-tinned flavor also. This is quality cable and makes for quick easy installations. I'll call that 5 Stars Thanks for Reading Tip: Don't get your crires wossed. Make a schematic – if you put AC power on the DC side your likely to fry your lamp.",
      "B0CG1GSW3P ★★★★★ <b>Quality wire that’s actually copper not just thick insulation</b> Got this wire to do a mod on my fuel pump on my Foxbody mustang. Anytime I see some good wire for a good price I get it. It’s hard to beat 30ft of Red/black 10 gauge wire for this price. This is a good quality wire. A lot of wiring companies will make the insulation really thick and skip out on the copper wire. This wire isn’t that way the insulation is thick enough without it taking the place of the copper wire. This wire is flexible which is what you look for when buying a good quality wire because the cheaper stuff is stiff and hard to bend. So far I’ve used this for my 340 fuel pump on my turbo Foxbody and I’m going to be using it for my electric fan on the foxbody. You need a good quality wire that can hold the load without getting hot or melting. If you do a lot of automotive wiring like me this stuff is a life saver.",
      "B0CPPWBGT8 ★★★★★ <b>High Quality Copper Wire - Great for High Current Applications..</b> When you buy electrical wire these days you have to be very careful to make sure that you’re getting a product that is actually copper and not some sort of copper cladded aluminum, which is difficult to use and can easily corrode. This wire is made from oxygen-free copper with a little silver and tin to protect it, which is especially important when the wire is carrying high current. It is easy to strip, readily accepts solder, crimp, compression, or butt connectors so you can make reliable connections and splices. The manufacturer also includes some heat-shrink tubing with this product but its small diameter (only a little larger than each insulated conductor itself) didn’t make it particularly useful. I did a high current test to measure the wire's resistance and found it to be 0.0025 ohms/ft., just what it should be for AWG 14 copper, so, this is definitely a high quality product.",

I needed16ga wire to drive the coils, but was interested in the flexibility advertised because the fabricated harness will have to snake through the bike frame. I was amazed at just how floppidy this wire is. Floppy is just the word. My finished harness had red and black runs through 1/4\" braid, and it was like snaking string through the tiny winding openings to go from the spark drive unit to the COP above the cylinders. This is great stuff. The 16ga is easily as flexible as the best 22ga wire I've used. Highly recommended.

The package includes five spools of very nice quality wire with five different color insulation used. Each spool has 20 feet of wire. I really like the insulation on this wire. It's a soft silicone vs vinyl which I most often used in the past. This gives the wire great flexibility, as well as heat and abrasion resistance. The most commonly used red and black (for positive and negative DC wiring) are represented, as well as white, blue, and yellow. The wire consists of (according to the ad) 252 individual tiny strands of tinned copper wire. I didn't order this pack for any particular purpose in mind, but rather to have on hand when needed.

      "B0CH861BMS ★★★★★ <b>Surprisingly very good wire.</b> This wire surprised me with how good it is. Pros: - Advertised as 16 AWG (American Wire Gauge), but is actually just a little larger, which is a good thing. - Strands are fine, but not too fine. This is perfect for use in almost any decent kind of connectors and it is flexible enough to be durable and nice to work with. - Insulation on the individual strands is of very good quality and they are powdered so the outer insulation can be easily removed. - The wire is real copper, with tin plating and the tin plating is of very good quality. This resists corrosion and will carry electricity very well. - Packaging was very good and there are 3 twist ties around the roll of wire, holding it together and keeping it neat. Twist ties are very good because they are much easier to deal with than zip ties and they are reusable. Cons: - Outer insulation is PVC, which will likely become much stiffer in cold weather, but it appears to be good quality PVC, so maybe it won't be too bad. I can't tell right now because the weather here is not cold enough now. - Clearly labeled \"Made in China\". Overall: Excellent quality product.",

The cable is made from high quality materials and feels very durable and sturdy in my hands. It has an SOOW 600V rating and is designed for use with motor leads, portable lights, battery chargers, stage lights, and machinery. One thing that I appreciate about this cable is its flexibility. Even though it is made from thick, heavy duty wire, it remains easy to bend and maneuver. This has made it very convenient for me to use in a variety of different applications. Additionally, the three conductor design makes it easy to connect to devices that require multiple inputs. Overall, I would definitely recommend the GearIT 14/3 14 AWG Portable Power Cable to anyone in need of a reliable and versatile electrical cord.

The green jacket wire is THHN/THWN (and labeled as such) - and that's what you want when using it outdoors or in otherwise harsh environments. The big box stores have similar wire, but they are typically sold on spools of 100 feet (or if you have the time and patience, you might find someone to cut a smaller piece for you to buy). This option was much less hassle and the wire itself is as good or better. If I had additional grounding (bonding to the intersystem bonding connector) needs, I'd buy again.",

      "B09KV23X1T ★★★★★ <b>Nice quality copper wire</b> This 16AWG 2-conductor wire is made well and is copper (vs. CCA). For modern LED lights, this will likely work well for most residential applications - 16AWG over 100ft doesn't drop too much voltage with only a few amps of draw by the LED lights. Incandescent/halogen would be a different story. I found the insulation to be very easy to strip without cutting into the copper wire.",

      "B09DB9FD5M ★☆☆☆☆ <b>It's 18 gauge electrical cable, but it's unmarked and smells very bad.</b> There is no spec markings on the casing so it can't be used in any application where a home inspection would require it. Mine came as a twisted mess that looks unprofessional and not really useable for anything more than auto speaker wire. Looks like just a haphazard cut from a much larger spool. Biggest complaint is it stinks up whatever room it is in. It is potent and I think the manufacturer knew this because it came double bagged. I thought the busted sauce that was in the Amazon box this came together in was what smelled up the box but several days later it's definitely the wire as I can smell it from 8 feet away. The price isn't bad and the copper wire itself seems ok. But the jacket used isn't useable for any code regulated work and it's only marking is the meter length interval. The jacket is also pretty thin and the inside wiring easy twists and came twisted. I wouldn't recommend it for anything beyond audio or LED work where the load is rather light.",

      "B0C2HS6QG5 ★★★★★ <b>True 10awg wire</b> This wire is true multi-strand, 10awg copper wire, not cheap aluminum and comes as duplex with both red and black cables. The outer shell isn’t silicone but isn’t overly rigid. It doesn’t appear that it is actual marine grade and the outer jacket doesn’t make that specification either. The jacket doesn’t conform perfectly to the copper wire and subsequently oxygen and moisture could get inside and cause corrosion if it’s not sealed properly. I’d feel comfortable using this cable anywhere that standard duty wiring was needed but I wouldn’t recommend using this in place of marine grade material that would be subjected to fuel or moisture. I don’t believe it would stand up to that kind of environment.",

When it showed up, it was practically identical to the cable that came with my Bosch mini split. Side by side and you can't tell them apart. The insulation, jacket and conductors all seem to be very high quality. This is exactly what you are looking for to connect your indoor wall units to your outdoor unit.",

      "B07MCF1BMP ★★★★☆ <b>Good quality wire, but excessively thick outer casing</b> The wire itself is good quality, no complaints there, but the outer jacket is very loose around the wires (which might be what some are looking for), but this does cause the overall thickness to be rather exessive for a 2-conductor 18 AWG cable.",

      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ <b>Outstanding value!</b> This cable is an outstanding value! Between the 4 conductors in the cable, you get 400ft of wire for $50 right now. Naoevo also included a whole whack of zip ties and heat shrink tubing which is an excellent inclusion to help with your wire install. The outer layer is a kind of thin rubber or plastic sheathing. It doesn't feel super strong, but it'll keep your wires organised over long runs. It'll also look better than 4 loose wires. The wires themselves are true 18 gauge and helpfully color coated to ensure you get your connections in the right place. The outer sheathing is a little bit annoying to strip away since it's so stretchy, but if you cut it vertically with your wire cutters, then clip off the verticle strips, you can get 'er done. The individual wire insulation is easy to strip and work with though. As far as the application for this kind of wire, I used this to have a clean run from my home theater receiver out to my rear channel speakers. Keeps the four wires nice and clean for the long main cable run, then you can strip back the outer sheathing where you need to connect the speakers themselves. This would also be excellent for car applications. This stiffer wire is easier to push through the car interior than single floppy wires are. All in all, as said at the start, this is a great value for all that wire and the included install gear. If you need versitile wire at a great price, this is for you!",
      "B08QJ23K5V ★★★★★ <b>High quality wire of a very useful size</b> I purchased this for a small project where I needed some 18ga cable. It has become much more useful than expected. I keep spools of 20 and 24 gauge on hand but this is just a bit heavier for more current and the insulation strips nicely and the quality of the wire is quite nice.",
      "B07CWQ6JPB ★★★★★ <b>Video Doorbell Deserves New Wire</b> I just purchased a new video doorbell for the house. When I removed the old doorbell button I noticed that the wire cover was, lets say, very old. The wire was covered in cloth, not plastic, so I knew it was OLD. So I though replacing the wire would be a good thing for the new video doorbell. The 18 AWG Gauge Electrical Wire was the right tool for the job. The wire is very well marked so you get it right when connecting it up. The copper strand ensures good current flow. It was easy to pull and the video camera is getting a good current that in turn helps it work. The 100' of 18 AWG Gauge Electrical Wire more than met my needs and as very easy to work with.",
      "B07NPJB5W8 ★★★★★ <b>Very nice and soft silicone copper wire - awg gauge is as described</b> This wire is softer than a wet noodle - exactly as you’d expect for silicone wire. The wire itself is indeed tinned copper, as I confirmed by scraping off the tin plating. It solders easily. The silicone insulation is more than adequate, but (perhaps due to how soft the wire is) it initially felt smaller than the 18 awg wire I ordered. However, my digital calipers confirm a 1.02 diameter, which is exactly what 18 awg should measure. That makes this wire the real deal and I would suggest that makes it an excellent value.

      "B09DSQ9YLC ★★★★★ <b>Good Quality</b> Very good quality I liked the flexibility well made 14guage wire",
      "B0C5BLQ327 ★★★★★ <b>Nice length for small project.</b> 25ft is not much, so if you are doing a small job it is great. 12guage is perfect as well for 20 amp breakers, and more than needed for 15 amps. This is a standard Romex style wire with vinyl outer sleeve and insulated individual wires, (white, black, and uninsulated ground.) I do wonder why we do not insulate our ground wires, but that is the standard here and I haven't seen any issues to date with that. Honestly, ground and neutral seem to be ok on the same ground blocks unless you feed into a sub panel where neutral and ground have to be on separate bus bars. Moving on from the lesson, I can say this is a good 12/2 romex that I can recommend that is also decently priced. Locally 15ft of 12/2 romex costs 28 dollars and 40 dollars for 25ft just to give some context on how good this is as a deal."

So, I hopped on Amazon to find a good replacement/upgrade. I was originally looking at 5-wire cables (after all, that's all I really needed), but then I saw this 18-gauge, 8-wire cable for just a few dollars more and decided to go with it instead. This would provide a degree of future-proofing (such as adding a whole-house humidifier, extra sensors, or the like in the future). This 18-gauge, 8-wire cable was thicker and stiffer than my old 20-gauge (?), 4-wire cable, and thus a bit trickier to pull through the wall from the thermostat to the furnace (be sure to check your cable path first to ensure it will fit (width of thru-holes, radius of bends, etc.). But, I just taped one end of the new cable to the old cable, crossed my fingers, and started a pullin'. Thankfully, with a bit of elbow grease, it worked! It looks and feels high quality and came in ample length for my needs (and then some).

      "B0CV7XP7JN ★★★★★ <b>True Marine Grade Tinned Copper Wire</b> So I really wanted to find out what makes good wire. Turns out there’s a few factors when determining a quality wire. 1. Copper is better than aluminum, as (semi) precious metals such as silver, gold , platinum etc. are superior, however, cost prohibitive. 2.copper should be bright and 3. The wire jacket should not show any wear or distinguishable defect with the heat of a cigarette applied to it. Makes sense for scenarios when a fire may be present especially on motor vehicles. 3. Must exhibit moderate to good flexibility. 4.the shielding must be smooth throughout. If not, that means the wire has not been produced be acceptable standards. Unevenness of the wire core may create sliding within the shielding due to looseness created. In my testing this wire meets all these requirements with only a slight mark off for slight mark left after the cigarette test. I think that this is adequate wire for anyone’s build requiring 18 gauge marine grade wire. The tin coated copper is even and well applied. The copper is on the rigid side, however, acceptable for good quality in terms of flexibility. I don’t think you would be disappointed with choosing this, especially, if your other choice is cheaper copper clad aluminum.",

What I like ~ • Feels like quality wire ~ the jacket feels like higher end microphone cabling. It's also fairly flexible and easy to shape. • Looks like quality wire ~ as advertised, UL is clearly marked and the jacketing appears to be uniform in thickness around the inner insulators. Copper is tinned and spun neatly. What I do not like ~ nothing to note here.",

      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★☆ <b>Great hobbyist resource for a variety of projects.</b> This collection of eight colors of 18ga wire will definitely come in handy for an upcoming LED & fiber-optic enhanced countertop project I have in mind. I have read that silicone insulation has a better flexibility and heat resistance than PVC insulation, which sounds like this silicone wire will be a good choice for my project. Although great for my type of project, I didn’t see any marking on the wire (too small?) and no listing, labeling or certifications found in the product listing. It’s not such a big deal for hobby use, but sometimes it makes a difference, mainly in other than hobby use. You probably know the rule: “When in doubt; find out!” For me, this wire will be appreciated and I am happy to have it in my shop materials. Thank you. MY RATING SYSTEM: Based on all things being “average” until I discover otherwise, with focus on accurate, not over or under ratings. Average is middle 3.0-Star not 5.0-Star. Since only full point scoring is allowed, partial scores will be rated higher if half point or more and rated lower if under half point. Rating scores may be revised at a later date if there is a reason to do so that was originally unforeseen. Thank you. 5-STAR = Much better than advertised and/or expected. Claims are realistic; ratings & certifications are appropriate and checked out where possible. Exceeds 4-STAR. “ WOW” kind of items definitely to be recommended. 4-STAR = As expected or better. Claims are realistic; ratings & certifications are appropriate and checked out where possible. Fairly priced, good quality & usability, not likely to fall apart. “KEEP & USE” items to be recommended or purchased again repeatedly as needed. 3-STAR - As expected. Claims are realistic; ratings & certifications are appropriate and checked out where possible. Items are good quality, well finished, and priced fairly however nothing stands out. Examples include mass-produced “ME-TOO” items for sale under many different names. 2-STAR = Not as good as expected. The item works, but does not quite meet specifications of 3 STAR or better as described above. “NEEDS IMPROVEMENT” 1-STAR = Far below expectation. Claims, ratings, certifications are blatantly inaccurate and/or inappropriate. Low quality possibly resulting in failure, injury or worse; poor durability. “NOT RECOMMENDED”",

I do a lot of low-voltage projects around the house. Holiday lights as well as sidewalk, and driveway lights. Always happy to have some extra wire for when I decide to move forward on adding more items to our yard. It will make for great power injection wires for holiday lights on the house. It is a thinner gauge than I normally purchase and it would be nice to have this on a spindle for pulling easily. Be careful that you are using it for low-voltage applications.",
      "B0CWNBZ164 ★★★★★ <b>Quality Insulated 3-Conductor Wire</b> This 3-conductor wire arrived in a sealed anti-static bag, and to my surprise it was also wound on a plastic storage reel. The outer PVC insulation is thick but flexible and has very little coil memory once straightened. The 22 AWG stranded copper conductors are nicely tinned, and flows solder nicely. Both the outer jacket and wire insulation are easily stripped with a quality tool and I did not experience any issues with broken conductors. The black/red/yellow conductors are convenient for many applications that have power/ground/control requirements within the 300V 2.2A rating. The -40℃ to + 80℃ temperature range also make it suitable for most DIY projects. The 22 AWG conductors are perfect for DuPont connectors, which are convenient for jumper wires, electronic projects, and testing.",

      "B0CWNBZ164 ★★★★★ <b>3 x 22G Insulated Wire</b> This is just basic 3-wire 22 gauge wire (red-black-yellow), most probably used for, say, low-voltage 24V applications like thermostat wire, or maybe speaker wire (although it's also not shielded, so that might result in some noise?) In my case, I just wanted some hobbyist DIY low voltage wiring to run between some of the 5V USB connectors I've been messing with in kits, etc. Might also use it for some other instances around the house and work bench. And even though it's rated for 300V, I'm not likely to use it for anything 120V or high amperage 12V use. 22G just seems a bit small for that. Good wire, tho, for lots of applications!",
      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★☆ <b>20AWG silicone wire</b> The 20AWG silicone wire kit included six 50 ft. bunches of wire of different colors. The wire is extremely useful for my electronic projects since it is very flexible and easy to use. I would have preferred the wire to have been coiled on spools vice six bunches of wire as received and not as they were displayed on the listing.",
      "B0CQP4KJM4 ★★★★★ <b>Good wire for use with LED strip lights</b> This wire is good for custom LED strip light applications. It is not too stiff and easy to strip and work with. The tinned copper means it will last longer without corroding and can be used in humid and marine areas. This is a great price and this wire has many low voltage uses even in travel trailers for lighting etc.",
      "B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ <b>Respectable wire for countless projects</b> I am constantly using various wiring for all sorts of projects. The car, the house, computers, various items I build in my shop (I'm an electronic engineer). So I can never have enough wire lying around. Got this to restock some 18AWG I recently used up on a project. Seems to be very nice wire for the price. Haven't used it for anything too demanding, but so far, seems to hit the spot as a good all purpose wire for various needs.",
      "B0BPLQ3PWN ★★★★★ <b>Better than average 18 gauge zip cord</b> This is 18 gauge zip cord with 2 stranded conductors rated as SPT-2 which has a 50% thicker insulation covering than wire rated SPT-1. In the online advertising copy the seller puts it forward as being for exterior low voltage landscape lighting - where it would be good for low wattage branch circuits (which is where I will be using most of these 100 feet) - however the package includes both a male and a female standard 120 volt connectors that would allow it to become an extension cord for a very low wattage LED lamp (18 gauge is too small for anything else especially if using very many feet of this wire). Overall this is a good quality wire so long as it is used within its limits.",
      "B0CBMZGNFL ★★★★★ <b>Decent cable for individual lights</b> I use this for landscape lights. They usually come with a very short pigtail which I extend to take back to a primary distribution cable. This is often fairly long since I like to run the main cable along the back of the planting bed. This cable has a heavy jacket that should withstand some abuse. 22 Gauge isn't very heavy, but my lights are always below 5 watts, so this is plenty heavy. The lighter gauge is easier when splicing multiples together, and its easier to hide. There's nothing special about this wire, but its entirely suitable for the purpose.",

(I had to make do in my last long-wire-hook-up project with a much more fragile unjacketed twisted-pair. ) • This jacket appears to be fairly tough, and I have little doubt that it will suffice for careful outdoor use (although the un-pigmented white vinyl will probably eventually degrade substantially in sunlight). • This white vinyl jacket strips cleanly using the number 10 hole in a pair of stripping pliers, ostensibly making it easy to work with. See the applicable attached photomicrograph. • The cable comes wound on a large diameter spool, tentatively facilitating its use. So far, this cable appears to be a high quality product, and I see no reason not to give it five stars. If I find out otherwise during long-term use I may revisit this review.",
      "B0CQFW25HT ★★★★☆ <b>Good for simple lighting options</b> Inital impressions are it's a decent quality cable for led lighting. It's not protected, so outdoor uses are limited- but with the awg being 18, it's slim like an ethernet cable so feeding is much easier. For me, it's great to extend some led lights in the ceiling without being too intrusive. Definitely recommend for those small jobs!",
      "B0CWNBZ164 ★★★★☆ <b>Slightly more resistive than the standard but good wire.</b> I tested the entire 50 feet of wire, each conductor. Resistance was at just under 1.3ohms. Standard resistance for 22awg stranded wire is under 1ohm, at about .8ohm (see picture). Taking my lab meter test leads into consideration, end result still falls short of standards, but not by enough to be too concerned imho. Wires are tinted, making them very easy to solder. I would recommend this for low voltage applications where slight resistance is not critical.",
      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ <b>Good low voltage wire, if you actually need 4 conductors</b> I see nothing to fault here. I joined two of the conductors together to form a 200-ft loop for a resistance test and it measured 0.9 ohms (after subtracting 0.1 for my test leads). That’s about right for 16 AWG wire. And I love how they included heat shrink to protect your crimp points. This is for low voltage applications, as indicated in the product title. I realize that (at least at the time of this writing) the product description claims it can handle up to 600V, but I’m fairly certain it’s not UL listed for that to comply with electrical code. If you want to run full line voltage outdoors without conduit then you should be looking for UF-B wire and there are rules about how deep you have to bury it (usually one foot at the very least — and that’s assuming you have ground fault protection). This product is either for low voltage landscape lighting (12-24V) or telecommunications. You don’t normally need four conductors for lighting, but I’ll leave that to you to figure out. Maybe you’re trying something fancy.",
      "B0CN2RB68V ★★★★★ <b>Great wire set for low voltage applications</b> Ordered this wire to use in some repair work on my old car. The gauge is appropriate and the wire inside the sheathing is stranded and seems fine. Overall happy with the wire for my application.",
      "B0CBMZGNFL ★★★★★ <b>Good wire, within AWG specs</b> Nice, flexible two-conductor wire in a weatherproof sheath. Received 100foot spool. Tested at 1ohm resistance- precicely what the AWG specs state should be for 20awg wire at 100 feet. Wires are tinted copper, easy to solder. Hopefully your order will be as good! Can't say anything bad about the spool I received. Nice product. Worthy of recommendation!",
      "B0C84BL61V ★★★★★ <b>flexible</b> I got this wire in the 16 ga. variety, and so far I've just used it to make a couple of meter leads which worked out great. The flexibility is a must for meter leads but I look forward to using this wire in other applications as well.",
      "B0C9D4VCK7 ★★★★☆ <b>Not perfect for landscape lighting</b> I am working on some landscape lighting in the yard, and ran a thick 12G wire around the yard to provide power everywhere. This 18G wire is great to splice into the 12G, and provide power to small groups of lights that are placed a bit further away from the big cable. When I opened the package, I noticed one thing I did not consider: This wire has a single outer mantle, and 2 wires inside it (instead of having 2 wires externally). This makes it harder to use the snap-in connectors, since you have to cut the mantle to expose the inner wires. Therefore, since this is advertised for 'landscape lighting', I cannot give it a full 5 stars. 4 stars will have to do.",
      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★★ <b>Great set of wires</b> I really like this wire. 20 AWG is a great size for the kind of electronics work I do with Arduino's. Easy to strip, easy to bend and solder.

      "B07RRPFSZ1 ★★★★★ <b>Perfect for low-voltage lighting, etc.</b> I liked this wire for making connections to terminal strips. Each terminal strip fed power to 2 12V LED light bars mounted on the underside of joists in my garage vi 18AWG wire. Each terminal strip was wired to the next one with this wire. Finally, the last terminal strip was wired, through a wall switch, to the 12V power source. Now I have emergency lighting in my garage during power outages.",

      "B0CWNBZ164 ★★★★★ <b>Solders easily.</b> I don't often use pre-tinned wires, but I need to remember these are a thing because they make having to solder a bunch of connections so much easier than soldering clean copper wire. Received a roll as described and was right at 50 feet in length per the markings on the sleeve. It's also nice and flexible while appearing to be within a margin of error of 22 awg (about 2-3% under sized when the strands were twisted into a firm wire). Was also wound nicely without a bunch of bends and kinks which makes routing it nicer.",
      "B0C5MGQNKS ★★★★★ <b>Good quality wire</b> It's exactly as it claims to be- 22/4 wire. The jacket isn't the thickest, but is certainly fine for light to medium duty applications. I wouldn't suggest using it anywhere it might get wet or soaked in chemicals. The cable is also quite soft, which can be good or bad depending on your application. It's fairly priced for what it is, and I like it.",
      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ <b>Perfect for wiring in auxiliary lighting</b> I needed to run some lighting into the cuddy space under the front deck of my boat, in addition to rewiring the bow nav light. Everything I'm using is LED, so I don't have to worry about current carrying capacity at all, for the most part, so 18ga is perfect for me. I'm rewiring the stern light as well, so I'll also end up running this from my switch panel to the rear. Having 4 conductors inside a single outer sheath does two things: It provides extra protection against abrasion, and it makes my wiring installation that much neater. Everything is as described; it's good wiring for many different uses. Would definitely buy again.",

Took a couple passes with the wire strippers to get it through the outer jacketing. The inner wires jacketing was also thick. You can easily see that this wire can handle being buried if needed. The 18 gauge can also handle quite a bit of current if running lighting (or even speakers). Little on the expensive side...but keep in mind that this cable is made for outdoors and/or direct burial and that is definitely what you are getting for you money. If you need to run a cable outdoors, do yourself a favor and get the right wire to do the job. Nothing worse than trying to save money only to have something short (or catch fire) on something cheaper. This is worth the price for what it does...",
      "B07TFF9FTM ★★★★★ <b>Nice selection of colors, though I really only wanted/needed red and black.</b> I needed some solid 18 AWG wires for connecting power from one under-cabinet light to the next. This was thick enough that I was completely comfortable that it could handle the current.",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>A Comprehensive Starter Set for Electronics Enthusiasts</b> The 18 Gauge Wire Kit offers an excellent starting point for anyone delving into the realm of electronics, whether as a hobbyist or a budding professional. This kit is particularly appealing for its thoughtful compilation of essential wiring needs, presented in a user-friendly package. Variety and Quality: One of the standout features of this kit is the variety it offers—eight colors of 18 gauge silicone wire, each extending to 23 feet (7 meters). While the length of each spool might not cater to extensive projects, the assortment allows for ample experimentation and small-scale builds. The choice of silicone for the wire sheathing is a commendable one, providing a durable, heat-resistant covering that forgives the occasional soldering mishap, making it an ideal selection for beginners. Additionally, silicone's chemical resistance and flexibility are qualities that veteran electronics enthusiasts will appreciate. Accessories and Utility: The inclusion of color-coordinated heat shrink tubing and zip ties adds a layer of organization and professionalism to projects, enhancing the overall utility of the kit. While the wire stripper may not impress seasoned users, it's a valuable addition for those just starting, offering an all-in-one solution to basic wiring needs. Packaging and Design: The kit's packaging is notably well-conceived, featuring a box with holes for each wire spool, facilitating easy access and storage. This system helps maintain a clean and organized workspace, a boon for any project. However, the opportunity for improvement lies in the visibility of the remaining wire on each spool; a clear plastic window on the box would have perfectly rounded out the design by allowing users to gauge their wire stock at a glance. Conclusion: In summary, the 18 Gauge Wire Kit earns a solid five-star rating not through groundbreaking innovation but through the thoughtful assembly of high-quality components tailored to meet the needs of both novice and experienced electronics enthusiasts. It stands out as a comprehensive and practical kit, perfect for anyone looking to embark on or expand their electronics projects with a reliable selection of wires and tools at their disposal.",

I’ve been wanting to relocate the power and emergency stop switch on a Chinese Lathe/Milling machine so that I will have easier access to it in case of an emergency. I hope this 18 gauge wire isn’t going to be under-rated for my application as the current wire appears to be pretty thin as well. Finding multi-conductor wire with more than 6 conductors at 16 or 14 gauge at a reasonable price is quite difficult and if I find this wire isn’t the right size I can always use low current relays and contactors as a work-around. If you’re running wire for speakers, PA or intercom system, this wire is perfect for those applications. And from some of the prices I’ve seen lately, this is a steal for 50 ft. of copper.",

The wire quality is pretty good and a lot of strands instead of just a few big strands or just a few strands at all. The wire is also really flexible and easy to manipulate to where you need it. What I really like about this set is the box that it comes in. You can pop the holes out and run your wire through, close the lid up, and then you have a dispensing box for your wire. As it is I have a lot of wire laying around and I don't need some more random rolls that I have to dig through to get to what I need. It comes with some head shrink tubing in the same colors as the wire, but I have not tried those out yet as I normally use butt connectors that I have already. Overall, for the price this item is a good deal. Five different colors of 22 AWG wire in a handy storage box. I recommend this item.",
      "B0CN2RB68V ★★★★★ <b>Passes all tests!</b> Great wire. As the video shows, the 18-gauge wire I got passes tests for gauge, heat resistance and even amateur \"proof of copper.\"",
      "B0BPLQ3PWN ★★★★☆ <b>Pretty Standard Zip Cord</b> I ordered this to replace the buried wiring for my low voltage landscape lighting. The old wiring was sized to handle incandescent bulbs, which I have now replaced with LEDs. That wire was pretty stiff to begin with and has only gotten more so in the 45 years since it put it in. This wire looks like the usual zip cord, it is flexible, the insulation is fairly thick, and resistance measurement shows it to be consistent with 18 awg stranded copper wire. Barring rodent attacks, it should stand up well. It would also be fine for speaker wiring and, because It is actually rated for 300V, you can use as 110V lamp cord. However, be careful to stay within the current rating, which might make it chancy for many appliances. The description says that it is tinned copper; that’s obviously not true but also irrelevant. The price/foot is quite low reasonable so I’d recommend it.",
      "B0C65LQYPP ★★★★★ <b>Not bad for CCA</b> Takes solder fine. It does look like 22 gauge wire and is inside a jacket that appears to be PVC. The wire is aluminum with a copper plating, or copper clad aluminum (CCA), not pure copper but is actually pretty good for low voltages and other general purpose DC related projects. Definitely good wire for the price point. Five of five stars. I recommend it.",

      "B0B6PGY65W ★★★★☆ <b>Its a good decision to buy!</b> I recently purchased the TYUMEN 40FT 18 Gauge 2pin 2 Color Red Black Cable Hookup Electrical Wire for my LED strip lighting project and I have to say, I am quite pleased with the product. The wire is of good quality and it has met my expectations. One of the main reasons I purchased this wire was for its length. The 40FT wire is long enough to cover the entire length of my LED strip lighting project and it provides enough slack to make the installation process much easier. The 2pin 2 color red black cable also makes it easy to identify the positive and negative wires, which is very helpful during the installation process. The red and black color coding also helps me to keep track of the connections and ensure that everything is connected properly. The 18-gauge wire is also thick enough to handle the current of my LED strip lights, which I found to be a big plus. It ensures that the wire can handle the power and prevents any potential overheating or damage to the wire. The only downside to this product is that the wire is a bit stiff, it's not very flexible which can make it a bit difficult to bend and shape to the desired position. But it's a small price to pay for the quality and durability of the wire. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the TYUMEN 40FT 18 Gauge 2pin 2 Color Red Black Cable Hookup Electrical Wire for LED Strips. It's a great investment for anyone who wants a high-quality and durable wire for their LED strip lighting projects. It's not perfect, but it's a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable electrical wire.",

I will be using these for various electronic projects – particularly those that involve frequent movement of the wire and/or exposure to high temperature. Wire like this is difficult to find locally and, so, to have a set like this with 5 colors and with 50-ft lengths of each is a great asset. I see that these wires are available in a range of gauges. 20 AWG is good for a few amps at low voltage for powering my Arduino circuits etc. This product is offered at a premium price but there’s a lot (250ft) of good-quality wire here so the value is good.",

I am using this wire on a Combination Hydronic Heating System the eight conductors allows me to do each run with a single cable keeping everything nice and tidy. The tinned multi-strand copper wire and the PVC insulation package is extremely consistent throughout the length of the cable making this my number one choice for future projects. I gave the 18AWG 8 Conductor Electrical Wire a Perfect Five Stars.",
      "B07T19567J ★★★★★ <b>Perfect for upgrading your Furnace for a smart Thermostat</b> I got this to replace my current 18/5 (18 gauge, 5 strands) wire from my thermostat to my basement. The new thermostat needed the additional wire for the \"C-wire\" to properly power the thermostat because it's a smart thermostat. Before you start make sure you need 6 strands, some may need more or less. You may not need a new wire. The install was pretty simple but could be wildly different for you depending on how it's wired. For me, I just cute the old wire at the thermostat, taped the new wire to it overlapping about 6 inches and then went to the basement to pull the old wire bringing the new one through. Since all the holes mine went through were good size it went through no problem. Since it's such a small wire (compared to electrical), hopefully yours is, too. You'll need some basic wire cutters and trimmers. If you've never done this before it's pretty easy but you should probably watch a YouTube video and practice on an end of the wire you can cut off. Don't want to expose any of the copper wire and cause a short. The wires are all the same regardless of color, that's for your benefit to differentiate them at the thermostat and furnace ends. Make sure you're very meticulous about this. Be sure to power down your furnace before starting there. Check YouTube for guides. In the process I blew a fuse on my furnace and got the blinking light, 5 times. I'm not sure what I did that caused that (probably use error this project was a first for me), but the fuse was near the wire inputs. Was cheap and easy to replace but essential to getting my furnace running again.",

      "B01K4RPB3O ★★★★★ <b>Good quality, high strand-count high flexibility tinned wire with silicone rubber insulation</b> This 22 AWG (gauge) silicone insulated wire is excellent for indoor or protected environments where high flexibility/lack of stiffness, and non-melting (or at least melt resistant) insulation is required. The conductors are a 'high strand count\" type, meaning that instead of being comprised of just a few larger/thicker strands, it is instead comprised of a much greater number of smaller/thinner strands; and this contributes to its lack of stiffness/great flexibility. The other contributing factor to the high flexibility is that the insulation is silicone rubber, rather than the more common PVC (which is rather stiff). This kind of high strand count, silicone rubber insulated wire is exactly what high quality test equipment 'test leads' have been made of for decades. The silicone rubber is also much less heat sensitive than more common insulations such as PVC or \"machine tool wire\". It won't melt off as readily as PVC insulation does if your soldering iron needs to be held onto a joint or terminal for an extended period of time. The fine wire strands are also nicely tinned, and the insulation strips off easily and cleanly, and the stranded wire solders easily. It is a good quality product at an affordable price. HOWEVER, it is not the best choice for many common \"hook up wire\" applications, since its lack of stiffness can be an issue; the strands definitely need to be twisted and soldered in order to keep their shape enough to be formed into a hook before soldering around a terminal for example. This wire also does not want to cooperate if you want to twist a few of them together, because their limpness makes them uncooperative in that regard. And if you use this wire in \"hook up wire\" applications, it wants to just flop into some odd position rather than 'staying put' where you want it to be. Silicone rubber insulation is also not that great when it comes to abrasion resistance, and resistance to some kinds of oils and such where other insulations may be preferable.",
      "B0C6K5T8BW ★★★★★ <b>Great Set</b> Was mostly looking for some wire, and got a set of breadboards as well. Decent amount of 22 gauge wire. Breadboards are workable, not the nicest I've used, but still functional, wire is the same, but no issues with it.",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★☆ <b>Nice Variety in this kit for DIY projects</b> I got this kit for all the little wiring jobs around the house -- repairing things, wiring trailer lights, putting up LED lights, etc. This kit is a nice little kit with lots of variety to get different, small jobs done. I tested the wire's resistance and per the American Wire Gauge (AWG) Table, I should get 6.4 ohms resistance per 1000 feet of 18 gauge wire. I don't have a multimeter sensitive enough to measure just 23 feet of wire as in this kit, but my multimeter was bouncing between .1 and .2 ohms. Right in the ballpark of .14 ohms for 23 feet that I calculate I should have. Sorry I didn't have enough hands to measure the wire and get a picture too. I also held the wire over a flame for several seconds. The insulation stood up just fine without and visible damage to the wire. The wire itself is very flexible and I like the silicone insulation. I didn't think too much of the little wire stripper/cutter included in the kit. But, it will work if you don't already have proper tools. The little zip ties are handy, but so few won't last too long! One more thing is I thought the kit is a little spendy for what you get. But, if you need several colors of wire, but not much of it, this may work for you. Better than buying several larger rolls that you don't end up using most of. Overall, a solid product that I can recommend, given the above comments. In my book, a solid 4 star product, very useful and a quality product. But, nothing too special. This product was provided to me through the Amazon Vine Program, on which I only pay the taxes on this product.",

      "B0CN9FNFZC ★★★★★ <b>Excellent cable, a bit overkill for thermostat</b> This is a very good cable, perhaps overkill for thermostat wire. It has 8 conductors and a very thick PVC jacket. The strands are of tinned copper (See image where I scratched off the tin coat). Colors on the strands: White, Black, Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Yellow, Brown. There is plenty of chalk when removing the outer sleeve. Chalk is used to keep moisture out, which makes it less combustible. It's not riser rated though.

It's exactly as described on the listing. Keep in mind that this is stranded wire and the jacket is a bit thick. It's very flexible, so it does work as a thermostat wire although overkill. Because it's stranded, it's not as quick working on it as a solid wire. So not ideal as a thermostat cable, but a quality cable regardless.",
      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ <b>Great Value For 4-Conductor 18AWG Wire</b> What’s not to like about this wire?

Each of the four wires have nicely tinned copper conductors and the red/black/yellow/blue colors are common to many circuits. You can easily strip the external black PVC and use the individual wires as needed. This is a solid deal for a combined 200’ of 18AWG wire for less than $40.

      "B0CWNBZ164 ★★★★★ <b>It's as awesome as wire gets. Good price. Pleasant to work with.</b> There's just not a lot to say on this. It is flexy and easy to work with. It doesn't tangle/bulge internally and it coils sensibly. My wire gauge confirms it's 22awg. I plan to use this in my hobby of LED lighting controllers where this works well to send data, ground, and +VDC (5, 12, 24) to the strands from each transformer. I was pleased at the way this is packaged. Instead of being on a spool that explodes with released tension when uncoiled, this is on a larger plastic spool that's easy to \"tie off\" for reuse and very closely matches (coincidence?) the spools that LEDs come on, allowing them to live harmoniously in a box or standing on end in a file cabinet. The sheath strips nicely. The wires tin well. The cable doesn't sproing into a garage door spring at pressure when released from the package to use. It's a good price. If you need wire at the specifications listed, it's hard to go wrong here. While there are a number of variables involved, the required math is pretty straight-forward. 22G is about 43.4 ohms per km or 0.0434 ohms.per meter. Your project may not be running all channels at max brightness on all bulbs (RGB...and sometimes W) at the same time or it may be doing so for only a fraction of a second. Doing it for hours inside a packed conduit is different than an air-gapped conduit or being in the open. Just doing some quick math, let's imagine a 241 WS2812 project (like a Hexagon or a short strip) where each bulb is pulling .60ma per bulb (full intensity, white, and eye-torching white ON) That's a 14.5 W fixture at 24V, so you can use 22 gauge wire like this to drive 283feet and still lose only 1VDC at 24V. (It's worse at low voltages - this is why you want high voltages if wire length matters. It's the reason the power company lines to you are at 10's of thousands of volts....) If you're just doing boosters into taps, I'd imagine the distance to be even longer. 22Gauge is a good tradeoff of \"easy to work with\" and \"enough copper to deliver your electrons without resistance\" (hahahhaa. Ohm's Law jokes never get old.) I also did a spot test on painting it and it seems to take paint acceptably well. Some of this spool is probably going to end up in a permanent fixture that's tucked/painted into a corner of mine. This cable seems to be everything it claims to be and a nice set of specs for consumer lighting. Not fusable strands. Not chunky/expensive solid copper. Recommended.",
      "B091GH5GT5 ★★★★★ <b>Good for dipole antennas</b> Normally 22 gauge would be too small for long wire antennas, but the insulation adds some strength",
      "B0CK4WHWBY ★★★★★ <b>Reliable and Durable Outdoor Wiring Solution</b> One of the standout features is its robust construction. The wire is encased in a flexible PVC jacket that not only makes it durable but also ensures it is waterproof, oil-proof, and UV-resistant. This is a crucial aspect for outdoor installations, providing peace of mind that the wire can withstand various weather conditions without compromising its integrity. The 18-gauge thickness is perfect for low voltage applications, such as LED lighting and automotive speakers. The stranded design adds flexibility, making it easy to work with and allowing for smooth installations even in tight spaces. Additionally, the direct burial capability is a notable advantage, eliminating the need for conduit in certain situations. I found the cable easy to strip and terminate, making the installation process straightforward. The overall build quality instills confidence in its longevity, and I appreciate the attention to detail in its design. In summary, the 18 Gauge Electrical Wire has proven to be a reliable and durable solution for outdoor lighting projects. Its waterproof and UV-resistant properties, combined with the flexibility of the stranded design, make it an ideal choice for anyone seeking a high-quality cable for low voltage landscape lighting and other outdoor applications.",
      "B0CWNBZ164 ★★★★★ <b>Just the thing for so many differnent projects</b> My wire came rolled on a 6\" or so diameter plastic spool, in a resealable bag (appears to be a static bag). What a deal... just perfect to both use and store, sits flat and doesn't take up much room and stacks well. Great start... The outside insulation jacket is a very thick PVC material, it wasn't real easy to cut so it shouldn't nick easily (think of a errant nick from using a wire staple). Even though it's a thick jacket, it's super pliable. The inside wire insulation both cuts and strips more easily than the outside and is easy to work with. I only hesitate saying a joy, because it sounds to corny... There's about a million different uses and projects that this wire would be perfect for, you'll certainly run out of wire before you run out of projects. It is NOT house wiring or electrical supply to anything... it's very small, 22 gauge is tiny.. In a house, it would be doorbell or maybe 'ring' style wiring (or alarm sensors), garage door buttons & sensors, not for lights or outlets, extension cords, etc.. Most people probably realize that - but I'm saying it here, just in case... Save yourself a trip to the local hardware and just keep a roll of this on hand.

We would have loved to have this in the past few months as we had to buy wire separately (and wire is expensive!) The reason why I am giving this three stars is that value-wise, all the non-wire parts of this isn't really worth the upcharge considering the small length of wire you are getting. I did a basic comparison, and another seller is doing six colors, 100 feet each of 18 gauge and that was $27. This would make a good beginner gift but the little extras like the strippers, the dispensing box, the ties....those are all very ehhhh. You know, expected low quality. I realize wire is expensive, but less than 200 feet total of wire versus 600 feet, even if two extra colors and some extra fiddly stuff for application, and paying $7ish extra for the privilege?

      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Easy to work with for small projects.</b> I needed some very thin gauge wire to do some small low volt DC projects with. The quality of wire wasn’t as important for this so I didn’t mind taking a chance on an unknown brand. So far, this seems to be as good as anything I can source locally, and 10 cents a foot keeps the price competitive. I like the silicone jacket. It makes the wire very easy to work with. I was worried it wouldn’t hold up as well to the heat of soldering, but I was very careful and had no issues. It was too small to really use a crimp connector so I did mostly soldering and heat shrink. The tinned wire took solder well and I didn’t have any issues with connectivity or creating a solid connection. I didn’t have my calipers handy to check this versus other 20 AWG wire but it seemed comparable. Even so, sometime manufactures use more insulation and less metal to give it the impression that it is the same size. With wire I am unfamiliar with, I always size up against the standard AWG amp ratings just to be safe. It’s hard to say if the jacket will hold up to harsh conditions. For my purposes, it’s being used inside an enclosure and is well-protected. If you’re going to use this for automotive, marine or exterior projects, I’d leave a piece of wire outside for a while to test it before committing to a full project. Overall, a good value wire option if you don’t have a power hungry circuit where only the best will do.",

      "B0B5DTDN64 ★★★★★ <b>Good Value and Handy Set</b> While not as good as solid copper, this is a versatile set of 22 gauge wire spools that will come in handy. At this price point, it is certainly a good value and nice to have on hand. The six different colors are a nice variety and help to keep the project organized. Plus, having 100 feet of each, is a real convenience. I always hate coming up short and having to run out to get more. The vinyl casing strips cleanly even though it is a very small gauge. This helps a lot so that you don't lose any conductors. Overall, I am very happy with this wire set.",

It is ideal for connecting speakers and other DC low voltage, low amperage appliances in a off-grid or vehicle based electrical system.",
      "B0CK4WHWBY ★★★★★ <b>Good 3-conductor wire for LED strips</b> This is great 3-conductor wire for LED strips, like WS2811 LEDs. The three conductors all share a common outer jacket that is rated for outdoor use (waterproof, burial). The colors are red/black/yellow, so it doesn’t use the common WS2811 color schemes, but that doesn’t matter. Each strand is 18 AWG, and should be able to safely carry up to about 12 amps. It’s just the wire cut straight off the spool, so you will need to be ready to strip and prep the ends yourself, but that’s exactly what’s expected for this. Very satisfied, 5 stars.",

The quality of the conductors, although I did not spec it out on expensive test bench equipment, seems better than average. Probably a solid four stars and a bit over. I plan to use it to light an \"ON AIR\" sign outside my bedroom audio studio. I'll update when I finish that project.",
      "B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ <b>Everything it should be - easy to handle</b> There is not a lot to say here, other than the advertisement for this cable matches what was received (that's a good thing....doesn't always happen these days!). The insulation, around both cables, is very thick should handle most extreme situations. The wires are actually stranded copper wire and not a \"copper clad\" imitation. The size is 16AWG and was tested with a caliper and a wire-cutter. The length was slightly over 32.8FT. Honestly, nothing negative about this listing and would recommend it if the price/size/options meet you needs. Everything came out as expected and would get it again if needed.",

Each of the 6 spools holds 50' of tinned copper wire for a total of 300'. Each strand of the 20 gauge twisted wire has been tinned before the wire was twisted and insulated in colored silicone but the ends should be tinned again before soldering to a terminal to provide the best solder connection. The insulation is easy to strip with a standard pair of wire strippers and the wire tins and solders well. I'm giving it 5 stars because it is quality wire at a good price and it is a welcome addition to my electronics repair supplies.",

The conductors are high strand count tinned copper, with individual wires tinned, making it flexible, easy to solder and corrosion-resistant. There is no aluminum in the wire, which is a great thing. The outer jacket is molded on, making it impervious to moisture and contaminants. Just google UL2464, stay within the intended use of the specification, and you can’t go wrong. Recommended.",
      "B0CWNBZ164 ★★★★★ <b>Accurate description</b> Wire description is accurate. It's 22 gauge 50 foot low voltage. I'm using it for a DYI LED light strip project to solder multiple LED strips together. It is working fine for that.",
      "B07H3TV5LC ★★★★★ <b>Used this for hanging lights</b> I bought some \"vampire\" sockets for some lights that I wanted to hang, assuming that they would work with 18-gauge zip cord, but they did not; they are for 12-14 gauge wire. This wire worked perfectly with them by separating the red and black wires at each point that I wanted a socket. The insulation is soft enough that I could get my vampire plugs and sockets that are designed for 18-gauge wire to work with it as well.",
      "B0CGQ29J9Q ★★★★★ <b>Perfect for outdoor speaker wire.</b> I like listening to music when I’m outside working in the yard. I move a column speaker outside and connect it to a small PA amp. The flexible KWANGIL 16 AWG wire makes this process much easier than the stiffer 18 AWG speaker wire that I had previously been using. As an added bonus, this wire is UV stable and also tinned to protect it from corrosion. And the tinned wire is super easy to solder. KWANGIL even supplies the coil with an end cap on each wire end to keep the wire in perfect condition until it’s ready to be used. The 20 feet of wire is supplied wound in a ~7 ½ inch coil and packaged in a sealed plastic bag. Thanks to the large size of the coil, when the wire is unwrapped it lays fairly flat unlike wire that has been tightly coiled. Stripping the outer jacket was just as easy as the listing said it would be. I stripped 4 inches from one end with no problem. Stripping the individual wires on the other hand isn’t as easy. The insulation on each wire is tight but that also keeps moisture away. Stripping ½ inch took a bit of work, stripping 1 inch I found easiest to do in two ½ inch pieces. The wire works great with the speaker and is easy to coil when I’m ready to put the speaker away.",
      "B0854JXFHD ★★★★★ <b>Good assortment.</b> Handy when you need small gauge wire.",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Good flexible wire</b> These spools of wire are great. They're soft, not stiff, and they do appear to be 22 gauge. There should be 6o feet of wire on each of the 6 spools and as far as I can tell it does seem to be the case. The wire is stranded and takes solder well. Definitely deserves a 5 star rating and I recommend it!",
      "B0CN9FNFZC ★★★★★ <b>Great Control Cable</b> I have some projects around the homestead I needed some multi conductor cabling for. Got this and it's a good cable for what it is. 18gauge so it'll hold a few amps if needed, but works best for anything you plan on having a few buttons or controls for. I don't have a set project I plan on using this for, but anything that's lower power for my tractor or mybe a control box for my genny, I'll consider using this for.",
      "B0C5F4T9J4 ★★★★★ <b>Works Well for LED's</b> Ran some power to a few yard lights and to power some PC fans. The 4-wires help with keeping things organized and have a thick outer case that offers more protection than some other products. Not much to say other than this spool of wire was easy to work with and made things simpler. Whatever small project you are working on that requires 22g wire, this should do the trick for you. I will say that the wire diameter is about twice or three times as thick as a ribbon cable and so might not be the best for applications where you are trying to conserve space or to fit flush against something.",

      "B0CN2RB68V ★★★★☆ <b>Sized correctly, good silicone insulation and easy to solder.</b> In terms of sizing my stripper pulled the insulation of cleanly on the 16 AWG slot so the wire is true to size. The insulation is good quality and feels the exact same as other silicone wire I have purchased at the orange big box store. It also took solder without any issue which is great as I have gotten wire on amazon that did not. A few things to note around the product listing, it says it's rated for 19 amps, this is really pushing things, 16AWG is light duty size. Most of your cheap extension cords use 16AWG so you really shouldn't be pushing more than 13 amps through this wire. It says it complies with North American Safety Standards but nothing on the box or wire had the normal stamps and marks that you find on wire you buy at the big box stores so I don't trust that claim. If you are using this for some basic stuff like lights or 12v applications, then it's really not a big deal but I would not use this for anything drawing any sort of amps over 10 and certainly would not put this behind a wall.",
      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★☆ <b>good quality wire</b> Accurate 18AWG wires. The wires strip well and hold crimps well. The outer covering is durable and helps keep the wires from damage. I used this to wire the tail lights on my trailer and it worked great.",
      "B0B28M2C5K ★★★★★ <b>Good wire, a little tricky to strip but otherwise good to work with.</b> I actually used this for 120v AC to run low amperage overhead LED lights in a covered patio. It's 18 gauge, rated for 300v, I'm sure it should be fine running 100w lights in open air - that's less than 1 Amp. It's been working great for a few weeks now and since it's visible, it looks very neat and tidy as well. If I have enough left over, I might use it for wiring lights in my truck.",

The pricing seems to be in-line with what you can get at local stores and from other sellers, so no issues there. And just in case, I've confirmed this is 22 gauge wire. You're welcome. :) I'm using this wire for a variety of 5v and 12v hobby projects, with both soldering and crimping on different wire terminals.

I've got 5 20-watt solar panels that don't do any good by themselves, so I'm building a rack to hold them. This wire will run to each panels + & - wire and combine them all into a single MC4 connector. In theory, I should end up with a parallel panel arrangement generating about 100w (18.5v x 5.5a), which is useful for a solar battery charger/maintainer. With the leftover wire, if there is any, I'll just make solar extension cables for low power solar setups. I can definitely recommend this wire, and I not only WILL get it again, I already did. 5/5 stars in all respects.",

The plastic sheathing totally incapsulates the individually insulated conductors. I also purchased some 18 AWG 2 conductor wire made by a different manufacturer. The outer diameters of this 16 AWG is smaller then the 18 AWG wire, meaning that the heavier gauge (16 AWG) wire has a thinner outer insulation sheath to protect the inner conductors. In the attached photo you can see the 18 gauge cable on the left and the 16 gauge wire on the right. I am disappointed with how thin this cable is and am concerned with it's durability.

      "B0C5T6BGR6 ★★★★★ <b>Great project wire for low voltage</b> I got this 20awg cable for 12v projects and the size is perfect for most of my low current power requirements. I wouldn't recommend 20awg to be used for 120v applications. 16awg is generally used for most household devices using120VAC . At 12 volts, (cars, boats, golf carts, etc) this wire can handle general low current applications. Low current for 12v meaning less than 60W/5.00A @ 12ft length or shorter. This cable is not tinned, so it is best suited for interior environments as this wire is not rated to be used where water and moisture can corrode the copper over time, reducing conductivity. The cable is easy to work with using a good set of wire insulation removers (Amazon won't let me post what they really are called). The name of the one I used in the attached video is \"Capri Tools 20010 Precision Wire...\". I've used them for a few years now and I'll never go without one again. Best $30 ever spent on wire tools. Great wire purchase, and I recommend this brand. I hope this information has been helpful to someone!",

This is useful for me for all of these things, where stranded wire works with the application. You've probably got plenty of other stuff you'll use it for. Strips cleanly. IF YOU NEED SINGLE CONDUCTOR WIRE, THIS IS NOT IT. This is 11-strand 22ga wire.",
      "B0CN9FNFZC ★★★★★ <b>18 Gauge 8 Conductor Electrical Wire, 50FT/15M Thermostat Wire,18AWG</b> This wire is way overkill for residential thermostat wire, but it's great wire overall... I personally stripped off the outer insulation leaving me with 8 colors of 18G wire for my projects, a nice way to get 8 colors of the same wire in one bundle... I will be buying more of this as I use up this roll... 5 stars!",
      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Great for DIYers and reasonably priced for copper with silicone insulation</b> The price for copper wire has gone up so dramatically in the last few years, I did a lot of rewiring in my house a few years back and a spool of 12/2 1000 feet Romex was $260 and now over $500 a roll at Lowes or HomeDepot. The prices for these spools are cheaper than similar PVC coated wires at Walmart for 20 gauge wire and these have more expensive silicone coating and tinned copper. Price wise these are very good wires and good for small projects or repairs on electronics. The wire is very flexible and good for replacing cheaper wires in outdoor equipment that are subject to the elements or chemicals. The silicone is good for almost degrees 400F which is great for power and heating equipment as they are more chemical resistant and won't melt as easily. I have two outdoor portable water heaters used for camping and the wiring on the units use the cheaper PVC and the insulation can melt when the heaters are used for extended periods. I have had to wrap the wires in aluminum heat wrap to protect the PVC cables now I can repair them with the silicone wires without having to wrap them with protective aluminum heat shields.",
      "B0BXT6SBZ4 ★★★★★ <b>Perfect wire set for those small electronic projects!</b> Nice little wire set for those small electronic projects. 22AWG stranded wire with nice flexibility. The sheath on these are very nice to the touch - almost like silicone. The box acts like a dispenser which is very handy. The set slips into one of my electrical bags so easy due to its size. Also nice they included some heat shrink tubing. A nice little set in a nice usable box for your electrical bag!",

      "B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ <b>Actually good wire!</b> This is a beefy roll of wire and unlike some other wire I've bought here, it's actually 16AWG two conductor with some nice insulation. This stuff basically has the look and feel of a nice power cord to give you an idea of how hefty it is, though of course being two conductor you need to be careful if you're using it for AC power since there's no ground.",
      "B0BYNNJS8B ★★★★☆ <b>Good Quality But Not As Flexible As I Had Hoped</b> This is good quality wire at a reasonable price. The 18 gauge I ordered appears to contain 24 tinned copper strands and it takes solder well. While the product description lists it as “flexible”, I found it to retain its shape much more than I expected for which I knocked off one star. That said, unless you really need ultimate flexibility, this is a good option at a solid price point.",
      "B000E91PXS ★★★★★ <b>Really great quality, Very satisfied with it</b> I have great reason to justify my satisfaction. I first purchased the transparent Crimp Connector/cap for my electrical work that requires large size of connector (10-12 AWG). I got it and tried it. No good at all. So I go back to try the traditional twist-on wire nut and found this one. It is 100 times better than the previous one. Although slightly more expensive than the cheaper one, it worth the money and time. This one works perfectly for wires from 22 AWG (small house wire) to 10 AWG (large thick main-power line wire).",

      "B0CN9FNFZC ★★★★★ <b>Nice well made cable</b> Nice highly flexible 18 gage wire. It is tinned, so if you plan to solder, that is even better. I am using this as a signal wire from remote/pendant mounted switches to control small relays. For this, it is well suited, possibly a little overkill. But I like having a little heavier gage than what it takes just to get the job done. In my experience, it lasts longer and more forgiving to unexpected issues and faults. The outer sheath is not terribly difficult to cut, but I do not think average use will cause damage to it. Probably not suited to use in a manufacturing plant where it would be subjected to many types of abuse. But for the average DIY home entrepreneur, it would likely be just fine. I think we all take better care of things when it is us who foot the bill to pay for them. The individual wires are color coded (think thermostat wire), so they are easily identifiable on each end. As mentioned they are tinned, so the are easily soldered as well. I like soldered connections. They are more trouble to install, but, when properly done, I feel they are extremely reliable and with lower resistance due to more surface contact area. Soldering is not always an option, but these wires will do just fine when crimped as well.",
      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★☆ <b>Copper wire in six colors</b> I ordered the 18 ga. for wiring up controls for landscape lighting. I only needed two colors but I’ll use the rest sooner or later. It’s stranded pure copper, not CCA. I didn’t know what to expect with silicone insulation. I knew it wouldn’t be as tough as cross linked PVC. I’m wiring between timers, relays, and terminal strips in an enclosed box and I just wanted something that looked neat. The silicon insulation on this gauge wire doesn’t hold a bend very well. Not a problem that small zip ties can’t solve. I’m glad to have the assortment of colors.",

It features two stranded copper conductors and PVC insulation. SPT-2 Lamp Cord is water-resistant, sunlight-resistant, and can withstand severe environmental conditions. SPT-2 Wire also withstands exposure to oil, acids, alkalies, heat, flame, moisture, and chemicals. 18AWG wire amperage rating is: 10 Amps 50 feet, 7 amps 150 feet, 5 amps over 150 feet Having said all that I do actually plan to use this wire for low voltage wiring of 12 VDC LED deck post cap lights.",
      "B0BXT6SBZ4 ★★★★★ <b>Good packaging, great quality wire</b> I like how the wire comes in a box that keeps things nice and organized. The holes on either side of the box can be used to dispense wire without letting the spools get unraveled. The wire itself is suitable for any number of applications. I use it for Arduino projects at home and this is perfect for that. 22 AWG wire has a rated current limit of <1 Amp, which should be fine for most low power applications. It's also a bonus that the wire pack contains some pre-cut heat shrink pieces although that shouldn't sway your decision to buy this in either direction unless you really need heat shrink.",
      "B073RDG2J6 ★★★☆☆ <b>Not quite as described. Hoping for best.</b> Update: I do now see some info on the insulation. The AWG and 200 deg C. But no voltage rating is marked. I'm worried that the wire doesn't have any specifications printed on the insulation. I would have thought that was a requirement. Nothing on the carton, nothing on the spools. The carton has check boxes for what gauge wire is inside. None was checked so I guess I'll have to trust I got 18AWG. Additionally the carton says silicone on one end and PVC on the other. It's described in this listing as silicon rubber. So I did I get what I bought? I needed to replace some wiring in a 1981 amplifier I'm upgrading. The loom I'm rebuilding is getting very thick now due to insulation diameter. Time will tell if it was good a choice.",
      "B0CN768S54 ★★★★★ <b>Works great!</b> I should have grabbed the 22ga (as I would use that more), but this 20ga works great! The black jacketing allows easy pull-through (as it is slicker than normal coatings). That was a nice plus! No sticking or binding for my install. This kit also has some zip ties and heat shrink, which wasn't needed as I have a case of both, but it was nice to have everything in one bag just in case! The wires crimped well with the connectors I was using. Overall - great packet to get if you just have a one-off install to get done quickly!",
      "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>Handy wire kit</b> With the many various projects I'm doing for one reason or another, it's nice to have various colors of wire around. The 18 gauge is good for smaller, low current circuits. I really like that the box itself is a dispenser, that way I won't have to worry about keeping track of all the spools and worrying about them unwinding themselves while being moved around in a drawer or something. The wire itself is aluminum, so not the highest quality, but it only needs to carry a little power, I wouldn't use this for signal wire that can't tolerate noise (speakers, sensitive control circuits, etc.). The insulation is rubberized and very flexible. It makes it a little more difficult to strip, but will protect it better from sharp edges so it's worth it. The included color matched shrink tubing and zip ties are a good touch too.",
      "B073RDG2J6 ★★★★★ <b>Fantastic hookup wire for guitars!</b> I was skeptical about switching from PVC coated wire, but this stuff is amazing (22 gauge). Stripping is super easy; after cutting with wire strippers, it just slips right off. The exposed wire strand is of really good quality, and it definitely withstood more heat that PVC or rubber. Will use only this from now on!",

      "B09V56LTY5 ★★★★★ <b>Very nice 22 gauge power wire</b> This is 22 gauge wire which of course is for low current applications. I do a lot of electronic projects and of course they all need power. This cable keeps things looking clean and it's easy to work with. The wire is stranded and easy to solder with. This comes as a roll of 10 meters (about 30 feet) and it's been great for my projects. No issues with this wire, it's working as I was expecting.",
      "B07JZC2MVM ★★★★☆ <b>Great for my DYI project</b> I recently used the 18AWG Low Voltage LED wire for a costume holiday lights display and was very impressed with its performance.

      "B07RRPFSZ1 ★★★★★ <b>Nice, flexible, tinned copper wire.</b> I bought this wire for a project on my boat. For marine application, tinned wire is a must to prevent corrosion and flexibility makes it much easier to route through the tight spaces in a boat. I found it easy to work with and did exactly what I needed this wire to do and the tinned copper should inhibit corrosion. Color coding was helpful as it was easier to determine each lead as compared to one with just a tracing line or textured jacket. I bought both the 16 and 18 gauge wire and both are the same except for the wire gauge. Worked quite well for my project and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase more. If you need a marine grade, flexible wire, give it a try.",
      "B0CH861BMS ★★★★★ <b>Good wire, nicely insulated</b> I got this to use with some of the 12 wiring I am doing in my off-grid shed. The outer insulation is very protective and makes it so the wire can be in a more rugged environment. The inner insulation is decently thick and easy to remove to access the copper wires. Based on observation, it looked like these were 16 gauge as advertised. My overall impression is that this is good wire at a price ($20) similar to others with the same specs.",
      "B01KWBPC7M ★★★★★ <b>Very decent wire. In depth review & Pics</b> Running some permanent LED strips in the living room vaulted ceiling. Needed wire to run through the attic from the LED strips to a controller about 22 feet away. Wanted something heavier than the 22 gauge wire you find everywhere, and I wanted 100 foot spool Those two combinations limited what was out there. Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white). Even with my current strips, would have been nice to be able to upgrade without having to re-run wire. Oh well, happy anyway!",
      "B0C5F4T9J4 ★★★★★ <b>Great wire if this dummy ordered the correct gage.</b> This is a nice well made wire spool that will come in handy for wiring something other than what I ordered it for. Need 16/18 gage not 22 so I was kicking myself once it arrived and I realized I did not select the right size. Yet, I will keep it to wire speakers or low voltage LED inside.",
      "B0C6K5T8BW ★★★★★ <b>Good set of wires and some nice bonuses</b> I like this wire set. They work well for my breadboarding projects and they have a lot of fun colors to choose from. I'm used to my other wire kit that really only provided a few options so this was a huge upgrade in terms of my ability to make my projects clearer from a visual perspective. I really like that this came with a bunch of prototyping PCB breadboards and 2 normal solderless breadboards. I have a bunch of the latter already from collecting them over the years but only have a very PCB ones that I've specifically bought and usually end up going through them a lot faster as I solder things to them making removal tedious. I like that not only have they given me some nice wires but they gave me a starting point for my next projects! Would recommend this set -- the wires feel the same (to me) as any other I've purchased previously at this AWG but they give more variety.",

      "B0B5DTDN64 ★★★★☆ <b>Poor Description, this is stranded wire</b> The description was not well worded at the time of purchase. This is stranded wire, not single conductor. Although the description clarifies this is auto 22 gauge, it stripped well with moderate pressure on the 22 AWG setting on my stripper. The wire does not have gauge markings on it, so you will want to label these if you work with a lot of different wire sizes. For low-cost projects that can accept stranded wire, this will fit your need.",
      "B0069F4HCW ★★★★★ <b>Bulky SPT-2 Wire</b> This is SPT-2 wire. I would have preferred SPT-1 wire. The insulation barely fits into the recommended fittings. Other than that the cord works fine. I don't downgrade any stars, because they clearly state that the cord is SPT-2. I don't plan to use this outdoors, but the quality seems sufficient for the price. You should also consider that the insulation is (again clearly stated) PVC, so no-one is trying to trick you here. This is just decent cheap cord to get the job done. Edit: Upon further research, it turns out that you cannot get SPT1 cord unless you drop your gauge down to 18 gauge. So, if you are fixed on the concept of using 16 gauge, SPT2 is going to be as thin and flexible as you can get.",
      "B0C9H1G52F ★★★★★ <b>Nice packaged and easy to use landscape wire</b> I was worried about using a smaller wire (18 gauge) vs some of my older wire at 14 or 16, but this wire works perfectly with my LED lights. I'm guessing the lower wattage requirement of LEDs makes this wire work just fine. I have it towards the end runs on my landscape lighting runs, and I'm having zero issues with this wire. It also works nicely with those newer screw-on piercing connectors. They bite right through the insulation easily and hold tight on this guage wire. And because it's a smaller wire, it's much cheaper than previous wire I have purchased.",

This is the type of insulation which is soft, and can handle high voltages, and is the same type that is commonly used on probe leads for your multimeter. This wire is tinned, which makes it easier to solder to. Each roll is \"only\" 5 meters long. For some people, this will last forever. For others, this will go quickly. I opted for 22 gauge wire, because that's what I'd consider to be medium sized wire, for electronics work.

With the affordable availability of high efficiency LED landscape lights, the need for 12 gauge cable is no longer there, unless the runs are extremely long. When the fixtures were pulling 20 to 50 watts, options were limited. The 2 to 12 watt LED fixtures I am installing currently are working with this 18/2 cable, so there is no need for 12 gauge overkill, unless you are concerned with voltage drop over 50-100 feet runs.",

      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Super-flexible and heat resistant.</b> This is premium wire with a very high strand-count for maximum conductor flexibility. The silicone jacket is immune to soldering temperatures with no melting or creep from the heat. The solid copper strands are tinned to prevent oxidation and to ease soldering. Working with high-flexibility and heat-resistant silicone wire is a treat compared to PVC-insulated wire, but the higher cost usually makes me limit its use to special projects where there is a great deal of repetitive flexing or where it is necessary to ensure that no stresses are imposed on the joint, such as when soldering to the pads of a circuit board. I would prefer to use silicone wire for everything otherwise. You can punch holes in the cardboard box and use it as a wire dispenser. At $6 per 50ft spool for 20 gauge wire this seems like a very good value, especially compared to hobby shop prices where you can pay that much for a couple 3ft lengths. Highly recommended.",

      "B0BPQDDNBV ★★★★★ <b>Good wire with nice solid flexible outer jacket</b> I use this size cable for many different applications, mostly low power and some audio. This came as a coiled roll of cable wrapped in plastic shrink wrap strips. I got the 16/4 which is a great cable to have on hand. Sometimes you need 2 wires, sometimes 3 or 4 but it's not realistic to carry around multiple types of cable to always have exactly what you need. This is perfect. I am very pleased with not only the 4 wires which are exactly as expected but the outer jacket. It's a rubbery feeling PVC that feels durable and waterproof. Currently at just under $1/ft this is priced well compared to retail outlets. Good cable.",

      "B0C48K99SM ★★★★☆ <b>HIgh quality wires, but slightly expensive</b> I was having problems with my 1st floor thermostat due to intermittent shorts in the wires that ran from thermostat to the furnace control board. I left the defective wire in place and ran this wire alongside. It fixed the problem. I had to open the drywall in two places, but patching and repainting wasn’t difficult since I still have leftover matching wall paint. The original wire is 18-gauge and looks near identical to this wire. Those worked without issues for over 30 years. This wire looks high quality. Hopefully, it’ll outlast my stay in this house. I’m also running some of this wire in-wall for controlling and delivering low-voltage power to several ioT devices. I could easily have used CAT5E or CAT6 cables for those applications. But I decided to use this wire because it’s more durable than the network cables. Also, 18-gauge wires are a lot easier to work with than 22 or 24 gauge. Good product overall but slightly expensive.",

      "B003J699RW ★★★★☆ <b>Good inexpensive antenna wire</b> Good quality, inexpensive wire for HF antenna experimentation. I wish I could leave a 4.5 star rating. I originally purchased a 100’ spool, used it for a project, and liked it enough that I ordered another 200’. I find 18ga to be a good balance between stealth, weight, and ruggedness. While the PVC jacket is more prone to snagging on branches than a certain brand of high end “Silky” wire, this costs about 1/3rd less—well worth the tradeoff for toying around with new antenna designs. The fact that Southwire is manufactured in the US adds to the value.",

This 16 gauge, 100 feet long, 2 conductor speaker wire with a CL2 rating was perfect for my outdoor setup. The white jacket gives it a clean look, and the fact that it's designed for direct burial in the ground made it easy for me to run the wire without having to worry about any additional protection. The wire itself felt solid and well-made, with red and black conductors clearly marked for easy installation. I used it as an extension cord cable to connect my speakers to my amplifier, and it worked flawlessly. The sound quality was great, and I didn't experience any distortion or signal loss at all.",
      "B0C48K99SM ★★★★★ <b>Very good quality - real solid copper</b> Great wire that has pure copper condutors. The outer jacket and individual wire insulation are easy to strip and work with. 18 gauge is good for long runs of cable to minimize power loss but it is actually a bit on the \"chunky\" side and a little bit difficult to work with because of its larger diameter and stiffer conductors that might make routing the cable a bit tricky. However, I have absolutely no complaints about the quality of this wire - just make sure the materials you choose are correct for the job you are trying to do.",

At 18 gauge it's big enough for most LED lighting runs. In the old days of halogen landscape lights this gauge would have limited the distance you can run but with modern LED you'll have no problem with voltage drop. I actually ended up using this as speaker wire in my shop. Now my neighbors can enjoy my music... :)",

Usually, that is all I need, but there are times when I would like to match the wiring of whatever circuit I am working on for easy identification. These wires are flexible, which work well in cramped projects. I mainly do LED projects so I went with the 18 AWG kit. It's cool that they have the little stripper and het shrink tubes, but I have tons of tubing and prefer to use my own strippers. However, it is great for someone just getting started or have very little tools etc. All-in-all, I like the wire kit for occasional use and I am very satisfied!",

The wire may run past a heated surface or it may just get exposure to the heat that can buildup on a sunny day. For those occasions Silicone coated wire is essential, this one is rated to 390F. I also like it for test equipment and a host of other uses where high flexibility is needed. This wire is multistranded and 20AEWG is a good size for general purposes. It appears to be good quality and shows no magnetic sensitivity so it is hopefully pure copper as stated. Recommended.",

The conductors are tinned copper (not copper coated aluminum) as described and there are a large number of individual conductors - helping considerably to make the wire as flexible as it is. The insulation appears and feels to be silicone (also as described). The colors are also vibrant as in the description. One nice feature is that each spool of wire is individually labelled - so once these leave their original box and I pick up a spool in 6 months I won't be wondering whether the wire is 14, 16 or 18 AWG - the spool is clearly labeled 16AWG. Overall I don't see anything at all wrong with this wire and give it five stars.",

Actually one is supposed to use tinned, stranded wire on a boat, but the BYAC or whatever it is says that boats aren't supposed to run smaller than 18 gauge (total overkill for LED lights) so I've never seen lighter gauge in tinned. At least this stuff is stranded. Works fine for my purposes and very economical.",

      "B0CV7XP7JN ★★☆☆☆ <b>Decent, but far from great</b> First, before ordering, understand that the wiring is VERY stiff. It sure doesn't make it easy to work it around the normal bends of a car environment. I needed to use this for my AC Epicenter (since it's such a low voltage draw). I didn't need to buy and install a distribution block as I'm running a single 5 channel amp, so I preferred to run from the front for power. After fighting with its stiffness, I gave up and just ordered a MUCH better 3 conductor from Crutchfield. World of a difference. So if you're ok with the ridiculous stiffness routing it through your car, it seems like a decent enough cable for low voltage and current. If you're like me and prefer accessories to help ease the install process, I'd pass it up. Not fault of the vendor, as it arrived super quickly. Had I not began using it, I'd return it.

      "B07GH7JHG9 ★☆☆☆☆ <b>This cable is comprised of copper clad aluminum wire</b> First the pros: The cable comes in a nice box and the cable feeds out of this box without tangles. The outer black sheath is smooth and feeds well through conduit without lubrication. The product is priced very well if you think you are buying top quality copper conductor cable. The cons: This is really lousy cable. The conductors are supposed to be 23 AWG but the box I received measured below 24 AWG. The individual wires are brittle and break easily. So easily in fact that it was almost impossible to terminate in an RJ-45 plug. After spending hours placing this cable through walls and attic space, testing revealed there was a break somewhere along the cable. Makes perfect sense. Just manipulating the twisted pair to straighten for termination would cause at least one of the eight conductors to snap off. I have terminated lots of twisted pair cable and this was by far the most difficult to work with. Also, the product title does not indicate this is copper coated aluminum (CCA) cable wire.",

This wire is less likely to tarnish than standard silver-plated wire-wrap wire. It's just the right size for data-level or small-signal connections to transistors and ICs, which move very little current and cannot overheat #30 wire.

The new thermostat needed the additional wire for the \"C-wire\" to properly power the thermostat because it's a smart thermostat. Before you start make sure you need 6 strands, some may need more or less. You may not need a new wire. The install was pretty simple but could be wildly different for you depending on how it's wired. For me, I just cute the old wire at the thermostat, taped the new wire to it overlapping about 6 inches and then went to the basement to pull the old wire bringing the new one through. Since all the holes mine went through were good size it went through no problem. Since it's such a small wire (compared to electrical), hopefully yours is, too. You'll need some basic wire cutters and trimmers. If you've never done this before it's pretty easy but you should probably watch a YouTube video and practice on an end of the wire you can cut off. Don't want to expose any of the copper wire and cause a short. The wires are all the same regardless of color, that's for your benefit to differentiate them at the thermostat and furnace ends. Make sure you're very meticulous about this. Be sure to power down your furnace before starting there. Check YouTube for guides. In the process I blew a fuse on my furnace and got the blinking light, 5 times. I'm not sure what I did that caused that (probably use error this project was a first for me), but the fuse was near the wire inputs.

It would work great with outdoor landscape lighting if need 6 separate conductors. Each strand is clearly color coded so that makes this easier to work with. Overall, I'm very pleased with this wiring. It is reasonably priced and easy to work with.",
      "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ <b>Decent quality wire in a nice package.</b> This wire bundle specs out as advertised, which is always nice. The conductor insulation is sufficiently thick to provide decent protection, without being difficult to bend. The PVC jacket containing the bundle is also decently thick, while being nice and flexible. It has a glossy finish which looks nice, but does attract dirt/contaminates. All this combined makes this six-core bundle rather easy to run for the overall size. My kit did not include the heat shrink or zip ties as advertised, but I'm not bothered by this since I have my own high quality supplies to use in place of these items.",

I'm a little concerned - the jacket is a PVC tube, not molded to the internal conductors in any way, and bears no markings - cable like this normally carries various markings indicating its flammability/flame-resistant characteristics, and so forth - but this cable bears no such markings. That makes me wonder if it meets all of the relevant standards and such. I certainly wouldn't use it in any application where that sort of thing were important.",

The roll of wire comes with plenty of short heat shrink tubing pieces, several wire ties, and two reusable hook-and-loop wire wraps. The insulation on each wire is thick and durable PVC and the outer jacket is flexible, yet durable PVC material. The wires inside the outer jacket are not bonded to the outer jacket, instead, they float inside the outer jacket. This allows the user to easily pull the wires out of the jacket as needed. This wire would make an excellent automotive or marine wire harness for multiple lights that require separate control. Overall, this 16/6 wire seems to be great wire with a durable outer protective jacket that makes it ideal for automotive and marine wire harnesses or for other low-voltage applications.",
      "B0BX8RKFL8 ★★★★★ <b>6 Conductors makes for convenience!</b> I use this in my power supply outputs which require 5-6 conductors.

Definitely better than what was offered at my local hardware store. Got the 50 ft even tho I only needed 25 (just in case). Good move on my part as there was an unseen obstacle in the wall and I had to go around, which burned up an additional 15 of wire. Now the Nest Learning V3 has it's own C wire and there is plenty of wire options left over for what ever we decide to add to the furnace in the future (which is why I decided to go with the 18/8 instead of the 18/5. Rewiring was fun enough the first time.

      "B08P6W9SXL ★★★★★ <b>High quality, future-proof thermostat wiring!</b> In anticipation of the arrival of a new smart thermostat, I realized to my dismay that my existing thermostat wiring did not include a C-wire (it only had 4 wires). So, I hopped on Amazon to find a good replacement/upgrade. I was originally looking at 5-wire cables (after all, that's all I really needed), but then I saw this 18-gauge, 8-wire cable for just a few dollars more and decided to go with it instead. This would provide a degree of future-proofing (such as adding a whole-house humidifier, extra sensors, or the like in the future). This 18-gauge, 8-wire cable was thicker and stiffer than my old 20-gauge (?), 4-wire cable, and thus a bit trickier to pull through the wall from the thermostat to the furnace (be sure to check your cable path first to ensure it will fit (width of thru-holes, radius of bends, etc.). But, I just taped one end of the new cable to the old cable, crossed my fingers, and started a pullin'. Thankfully, with a bit of elbow grease, it worked! It looks and feels high quality and came in ample length for my needs (and then some). I used a 'Uxcell a10073000ux0031 2 Pcs 8 Position Double Row Screw Terminal Covered Barrier Strip 600V 25A' to connect the new 8-wire cable (right) to the existing furnace wiring (left).",

A great feature is that the wires are copper tinned providing the option of sodering connections. Having 8 conductors affords a nice variety of plausible applications. The item appears as described by the seller, although the wire may be a bit shy of a true 18 guage. Accordingly, it would be best to exercise caution as to the amount of current in which you plan to use with this wire. I am pleased with this item and believe you will be as well. Therefore, Dr. T. recommends this product with the caveat that it may not have a true 18 guage capacity.",
      "B08P6W9SXL ★★★★☆ <b>Good Wire, brown wire is cream color</b> It’s a good wire, durable and built well. Most standard 18/8 thermostat wires come with a brown wire. Instead of a brown wire the color of this one is cream. While this might not be a big deal to some, it can be confusing to some HVAC techs who are used to seeing brown and mistake the cream for white. Which can lead to things being connected wrong, which can lead to other problems. Otherwise it’s a good purchase.",

The strands are of tinned copper (See image where I scratched off the tin coat). Colors on the strands: White, Black, Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Yellow, Brown. There is plenty of chalk when removing the outer sleeve. Chalk is used to keep moisture out, which makes it less combustible. It's not riser rated though.

It's exactly as described on the listing. Keep in mind that this is stranded wire and the jacket is a bit thick. It's very flexible, so it does work as a thermostat wire although overkill. Because it's stranded, it's not as quick working on it as a solid wire. So not ideal as a thermostat cable, but a quality cable regardless.",

Looked at and tried many types and they were never flexible enough to give me the comfort that they wouldn't bind or have the wires break inside. This stuff flexes so well that it can be routed easily and definitely will clean up the wiring, it even maintains it's path and doesn't flop to the side so it won't need anything more than a strand of filament to keep it inline and away from motion parts. I can run all 3 fans, thermistor, and 3 wire LEDs in this one cable with all their individual wires hooked up. If you run even a cheap breakout toolhead and deck pcb with a common ground you can add in the 5 BL probe wires into it and only have your servo cable and heater wires separate in the sleeving, which they should be anyways due to size/current differences. All this in a 6mm or so package. I did tidy wiring before but could never get all the wires to less than 11-12mm and they were always lumpy and didn't flex well binding up my toolhead on certain movements. This will help me get it down to less than 10mm diameter in total. If i upgrade to a board system i'll definitely come back to see if there's a cable with the proper number i need to keep all the low voltage in one.

My methodology for Vine Program products is to give a more thorough -- often product-destructive -- review. If I like the product, I buy my own version of it, otherwise, it gets donated post-testing. I also may include my opinion on the product's value proposition to the market.

It's thick, and doesn't have a strong odor (common in cheaper products). Each comes with some zipties and a few pieces of heat-shrink if you need it. Inspection of the individual wires does seem to indicate tinned copper (instead of tinned aluminum), but I'd need a better device to really tell.

I'm very excited to see how they intend to wire 600v with this. Maybe I'm ignorant but that seems a bit misleading mixed with the 8/3 title.

      "B079NXCN6B ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Terrible adhesion renders the product useless</b> I bought 2 rolls of this cable, one with 2 conductors and another one with 4 conductors to wire my surround speakers. The cable is VERY finicky. You are supposed to flatten the cable, terminate it with the terminals (extra), test the cables before gluing them and clean the wall very well. So I spend about 3 hours doing all the prepping, and then installing it, with a hairdryer and a plastic card to flatten the cable as I went. Everything went pretty well and I was able to enjoy a movie that night. My plan was to add texture and paint the next day. The very next day I woke up to half of the cable detached from the wall. Total disaster. Re-installing it is a total pain. I contacted support and they told me that the textured wall shouldn't be a problem and to try again. What I did was to redo the installation in the baseboard. The results, after a couple of weeks, has been the same. The cable is starting to detach in some areas and now I'm wondering if I should add a stronger glue (very messy) or change cables (after the big investment on these ones). The idea is great, but in order to install this, be prepared to need to use additional glue and refinish the cables to add adhesion, otherwise this is not going to work.",

      "B0CN9FNFZC ★★★☆☆ <b>Handy multi-conductor cable; probably not quite 18ga?</b> As the title says, this multi-conductor cable will come in handy for a number of my DIY projects. Since some of those may involve something on my boat, having tinned conductors is a real plus -- it does help prevent corrosion of the copper, and you can see the tinned strands in one of my included photos. My one issue with this product is the claim that the conductors are 18 gauge. Granted, I don't plan to use this anywhere that I'll be pushing the limits of an 18ga wire, but I did want at least to test the claims. I don't have a great way of measuring the diameter of the wire, especially with twisted strands. This is technically what the wire gauge means. However, a wire's resistance is a function of its cross-sectional area, and there are numerous free online calculators to let you determine what the resistance of a certain gauge of wire should be for a given length of wire. Here's what you do: Search for wire resistance calculator Enter 18 gauge and 50 ft You get 0.319 ohms Measure the resistance of one conductor for the entire 50' spool Compare your resistance reading to what it should be As shown, I used the red conductor (they should all be the same) and I got between 0.38 and 0.40 ohms. Since the resistance is higher than it should be for 18 gauge, I can know with reasonable certainty that the wire is smaller than 18 gauge. In fact, a 19 gauge wire (uncommon in the US) should be right at 0.403 ohms for 50' of wire. This all may not sound like much, but the resistance is over 22% higher than it should be for 18ga, which means that you're getting 22% less copper than you're expecting. All that's to say that this product seems fine, and as long as you're not depending on the full conductivity of a true 18 gauge wire, you'll be good. However, I tend to score products pretty harshly when they make claims that they can't hold up to, and sadly that's the case with this cable. Buy it and use it, eyes wide open, or buy something else if you need a true 18 gauge wire.",

I've now ordered this 16 Gauge, UL 2464 Tinned Copper Stranded Wire for LED Lighting in 3 different flavors. I got the 3 wire / conductor, the 5 wire, and now the 4 wire. The 5 wire is great for LEDs with a DC dimmer (AC - hot, neutral, ground & DC positive, negative for my dimmer switch). Boom! all done 1 cable. I got this 4 wire for my third LED high bay; I already had an available ground in the rafters next to the fixture. I ran the cable down and 2 AC wires (hot to toggle switch, neutral to neutral) & 2 wires for DC dimmer. Done. The 3 wire I used for my first High Bay - I had another two wire cable for the DC dimmer. I had to zip-tie those two together. This 3 wire cable is all you need for a non-dimmable LED or an LED fixture that uses AC dimmer technology. The wire is - nice supple / pliable PVC insulated 1/4\" outside diameter 16 gauge tinned copper. The Engineering Tool Box specs this wire at 6 amp carrying capacity up to 1000v @ 30 deg. C (86 F) ambient temperature. There is a .71 correction factor for temperatures between 41 - 45 deg. C (105 - 113 deg. F) So: 6(amps) x .71 = 4.26 4.26 amps is enough amperage for (3) 150w LED lamps. I'm using each cable for one fixture – I prefer to have the amperage up there for additions and the extra cost is minimal. I don't mind the extra cost for the marine rated tinned copper, but this company sells the same cable in the non-tinned flavor also. This is quality cable and makes for quick easy installations.

      "B07TFF9FTM ★★★★★ <b>Ultra flexible wire, 200C, great value!</b> Very happy with this wire set -- great value, and it's what the listing says it is. Be sure you know what you're buying. This is ultra flexible, with many super-fine strands and silicone rubber insulation marked 200C (higher than PVC but lower than PTFE). The fine strands (150 of them, but I didn't count!) can be a bit of a challenge when crimping contacts... make sure no microscopic strands escape the crimp -- then it works great. The insulation is thick but soft: very easy to work with but also easily damaged if used in the wrong application. It's the right cable for routing in tight locations, since it's so willing to bend and lay flat... good for DIY drones (flexing arms or retracting legs) or making wiring harnesses that need to flex but are well protected from abrasion and pinching. For more rugged high-temp insulation, consider PTFE but it is much more difficult to work with and hard to find at a reasonable price. As noted by others, some colors are a bit off. Red is clearly orange, and blue is gray-purple. That's okay for my purposes, but maybe not if you are building to a print for assemblies that will be inspected. The velcro wraps keep each spool neat, and the box is good for organizing these spools when lots of other wire spools are around.",

The red and black conductors are not fused as is often common for this type of wire. If you are looking to connect a two-way radio or some other high-draw device, then routing the wire could be challenging since both black and red are completely separate. Given its diameter and insulation, I suspect that this wire is within spec and suitable for many applications."

Amazon delivered this wire last night and I didn't find it till morning. The package was covered in snow and it was 20F. I opened the package, and this wire was as flexible as it could be. I started to make a cable with it and noticed the two wires split very easily, too easily. With only moderate use this wire will keep separating. The ends should always have a piece of heat shrink tubing at the ends to prevent it from becoming two wires, even when storing. That is partially an effect of the insulation being so flexible. From the picture you can see how many small flexible strands there are. I measured one with my caliper and the reading was 0.002 inches. This is really nice wire to work with because of the extreme flexibility. I took a piece of insulation and hit it with my soldering iron set to 593F.

      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★★★ <b>Actually heat resistant, at least short-term, and insulation is good thickness and softness</b> With this being sold as silicone insulation, I tested it for heat resistance by holding the end directly in a gas stove flame for one minute. After a minute of flame contact, the insulation was chalky and white over about 1/2 inch, and the 1/4 inch that was directly in the flame was significantly weakened. The bottom part that got the most heat was easily peeled off with a fingernail. The top part lost about half its thickness, becoming the white chalky powder that didn’t stay attached, but the lower layers were still functional insulation. The insulation that was right next to the flame lost its gloss but stayed flexible and fairly tough. The portion of insulation just 1/2 inch away from the flame was completely unaffected despite probably reaching a few hundred degrees F in temperature. Seriously impressive results for generic wire, and this appears to be actual silicone insulation. The usual concern I have with off-brand wire like this is that the insulation will have one of a few common problems: the most common is being excessively thick to give the impression that the wire is lower-gauge than it actually is, and then it’s made very soft to keep it flexible so it ends up weak and vulnerable to damage. The other common problem I’ve found is thin, hard insulation and coarse wire stranding so the wire has too much “memory,” making it a pain to work with while still not offering much toughness. This wiring is in the middle, with a good moderate insulation thickness, fine strands, and what seems to be a good balance of flexibility and protection from the insulation. It’s still on the soft side, but feels like it will be fairly tough. It still definitely feels like cheap wire to me, but it’s a good price and it should get the job done.",

      "B079NXCN6B ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Started peeling off in less than a day</b> It doesn't stay stuck to my wall. I followed the instructions and watched the video beforehand. I wiped the wall with a damp microfiber to remove any dust and let it dry. I then applied the Ghost Wire starting at one end, peeling about a foot of the backing off at a time, smoothing it and rubbing it to the wall. Working the wrinkles out as I went along. Within one day, both ends of the run had about 6 inches peeling off the wall. Three days later, and both ends are now peeled off about 2 feet. Every morning I've tried to rub it back to the wall. My walls do have a very slight orange peel texture. Perhaps on a smooth finish the Ghost Wire would adhere better. I have not attempted to paint over it yet (and likely won't since it doesn't stay on). The total length of my application was 11.5 feet. Beyond the issue of it not remaining adhered, there were a couple other issues as well. First, there's about 1/8 of clear adhesive which is not covered by the white surface material running down the entire length of the roll. This is very visible (and sticky feeling). I was hoping that I could spray some wall texture over it since paint will likely not cover it correctly. I also snapped off my exposed ends when attaching the end connectors. Since the copper is very thin, any etching done with a razor blade to cleanly expose the copper strips weakens it to the point that any flex will shear it off. I had to peel back and use scissors, leaving a small flap rather than a nice clean transition. My Ghost Wire also was quite wrinkled from being rolled up. The manufacturer states that it's a known issue and recommends a heatgun/hairdryer to remedy so I expected that going in I liked the idea of this product. If it would have stayed on the wall, it would have been great. Even with the problems I had, I could see this working well if run under a carpet. I'm contemplating using a router to notch a shallow channel in the drywall and then just mud over the inserted wire. [update] A week later, and it's completely peeled off. Not an inch is left stuck to the wall. It's just hanging between the two connector blocks that are screwed in.",

      "B0CSD3GJ53 ★★★★★ <b>Great wire, but not compatible with some crimp connectors</b> I installed our landscape lighting almost 2 decades ago. Some bulbs have gone out due to failing electrical connectors. I tried replacing the connectors, but the insulation on the existing wire has become so hard that the prongs on the connectors just don’t penetrate correctly anymore. I ordered this to replace that hardened landscape wire. Unfortunately, the Quic Disc connectors I used previously do not work with this wire. Its insulation is slightly thinner than the original wire, and the conductors are spaced closer together. The Quic Disc prongs don’t align properly with the new conductors. If one prong hits the center of one conductor, the other prong can miss the other conductor entirely. The lights are only a few feet apart in a long flower bed, and I didn’t want to cut this wire into many short segments to use wire nuts at each light. So I tried the new Malibu Low Voltage Cable Connectors that pierce the insulation from both sides. They work perfectly, and have the advantage that the wire doesn’t have to be split apart every few feet to use an alternate piercing connector. Bottom line, this is great wire, with real copper conductors and flexible insulation that is easy to work with. It just isn't compatible with crimp connectors that expect the conductors to have the same spacing as in old 12 gauge landscape wire.",

Connecting the through wires on the top of the “tee” was fairly easy to do, but it required the assistance of pliers to ease the top down to pierce the insulation. Connecting the wires on the bottom of the “tee” wasn’t as easy. It took a couple of attempts to align the wires and hopefully get both to connect. The use of pliers was also required. Prying the top open required lifting 2 small tabs that can be a bit challenging to get them both to release at the same time.

      "B08TB4BVV9 ★★★★★ <b>1920s look without the risk of actual 1920s wiring.</b> It never looks right to restore an older electrical device with new AC cord. The trick then is finding fabric-wrapped cord that is safe and at least has the appearance of electrical cord from the 20s and 30s. Luckily, a variety of providers have arisen over the past few years. Here we have one where most of the work has been done for you, with the AC plug already connected. Now there's no question that this is a contemporary AC plug, and if you're doing a genuine restoration, you probably won't go this route, but there's also no question that this is a safe approach and one that is probably going to be hidden by furniture anyway. In this case, the fabric wrap covers two independently insulated wires, already stripped and soldered and ready to be wired directly into your device, lamp, appliance, etc. The fabric has a nice sheen and looks great; I picked the brown color to go with a copper lamp - works perfectly."

This is copper wire, NOT CCA wire (copper coated aluminum). Each lead, red and black have a substantial insulating cover. In addition, both leads/wires are surrounded by another insulation layer that binds everything together. The finished product is round and smooth. This is designed as a direct burial wire. That means it can be used outside, including in the dirt just as it is. However, remember to make all connections perfectly watertight. Part of my project will have the wire exposed to direct sunlight. So I feel certain it will hold up for a long time. Today I made connections using this wire by soldering as well as crimping connectors. I was super pleased with how it performed. Thanks for reading my review!

The wire is extremely flexible which is what you want from a good quality wire. I did take a fine emery board to the wires to verify that the strands were indeed copper and they were, the copper color revealed itself. So no aluminum in the strands. I have already used the 16 and 18 awg wires for replacement test leads on my DMM, power supply and electronic load. Very good wire!",
      "B0C5F4T9J4 ★★★★★ <b>Soft and Flexible</b> I was very impressed by the quality of this wire when I recieved it. The cable is soft and flexible while the insulation feels strong and durable. The 4 conductors are not very thick but will be sufficient for powering LED strips over a moderate distance. I would not use the wire in a location where it is exposed to the elements but for use inside a PVC conduit or indoors, it works perfectly and should last forever. Its easy to work with (cut, strip, solder). I liked that the pure copper strands wick solder immediately without having to apply excess heat which can damage the soft insulation. Overall this is a great value wire for any low voltage application requiring 4 conductors.",
      "B0CSD3KPX3 ★★★★★ <b>Good length, great wire</b> For all your landscaping needs, this wire has you covered! Pros: Solid copper and durable insulation. This paired wire is made so the individual wire can be pulled apart and still retain their insulation. The wire insulation is black so it will withstand the elements well. It's a 100 foot roll to make sure you don't come up short. The strands are pretty stiff and should crumple when you slide them into connectors and it's solid copper so it will solder well. Cons: None from me.",
      "B09KV23X1T ★★★★★ <b>Pure Copper, 16 gauge, direct burial</b> Review for: 'HONDERSON' 16/2 Low Voltage Landscape cable, direct burial Do the math! When it comes to outdoor, 12v landscape lights, you need to properly size the cable for the circuit. To do that, you take the number of lights you want to have on one circuit, and multiply by the number of watts. Nowadays, a typical LED type, 12 v light is in the 3 to 5 watt range. This is solid copper (the good stuff) 16 gauge cable, so it can handle up to 13 amps (which is about 1,500 watts!) but voltage does drop over distance. So this could easily handle one of the outdoor lighting kits or if you just want to add some more lights. (Old style, incandescent lights are a different story) 100% pure copper, direct burial, can't get much better than that, especially at this price",
      "B0BPQDDNBV ★★★★★ <b>Horay for OFC!</b> I didn't realize what the big deal with CCA (copper clad aluminum) was until I tried to solder it, that was rough. This is pure copper, I don't fully understand what the \"oxygen free\" portion means vs any other copper, but it sure is nice and easy to solder! This is kind of specialized wire with four color-coded conductors within a durable and flexible PVC jacket. The jacket is so tough that I would trust using it in an automotive application without additional conduit or sleeving. I think I will use some of it to add power door locks to a classic car that doesn't have any, seems like it will be flexible enough to withstand the door opening and closing many times without issue.",
      "B0CSD3GJ53 ★★★★★ <b>Great wire, but not compatible with some crimp connectors</b> I installed our landscape lighting almost 2 decades ago. Some bulbs have gone out due to failing electrical connectors. I tried replacing the connectors, but the insulation on the existing wire has become so hard that the prongs on the connectors just don’t penetrate correctly anymore. I ordered this to replace that hardened landscape wire. Unfortunately, the Quic Disc connectors I used previously do not work with this wire. Its insulation is slightly thinner than the original wire, and the conductors are spaced closer together. The Quic Disc prongs don’t align properly with the new conductors. If one prong hits the center of one conductor, the other prong can miss the other conductor entirely. The lights are only a few feet apart in a long flower bed, and I didn’t want to cut this wire into many short segments to use wire nuts at each light. So I tried the new Malibu Low Voltage Cable Connectors that pierce the insulation from both sides. They work perfectly, and have the advantage that the wire doesn’t have to be split apart every few feet to use an alternate piercing connector. Bottom line, this is great wire, with real copper conductors and flexible insulation that is easy to work with. It just isn't compatible with crimp connectors that expect the conductors to have the same spacing as in old 12 gauge landscape wire.",
      "B07ZBLZHN2 ★★★★★ <b>Very high quality flexible wire</b> Review of: **Spartan Power Bulk Battery Cable Made in The USA UL Listed 100% Pure Cooper Wire** I am very pleased with this wire - I purchased 4 gauge, and even at this thick size, this wire is very flexible. The insulation is very thick and has a nice, slightly rubbery texture. This is going to be perfect for my upcoming solar controller and lithium battery charging system in my travel trailer. It cuts very nicely and I will be adding pure copper crimps for my connectors. I have other battery cable and wiring from Spartan Power and it is always first-rate quality.

I got this for outdoor and attic runs for sensors or power. 8mm overall diameter, 1.8mm insulated wire, 1mm wire. Copper clearly visible at cut ends. Some white powder between insulated wires, perhaps for moisture or lubrication between wires for flexibility. 910mV voltage drop over length at 2A, works out to 9.29 ohms per 1000 ft. which corresponds roughly to 20AWG wire. 18AWG would be ~1.2mm dia. and 7 ohms per 1000 ft.",

I've been looking for a quality shielded 4 conductor cable to be used in a HVAC data line application. This cable meets the bill and then some. The jacket is tough and protective of the 100% shield with a pure stranded copper drain wire. Each conductor is also pure copper and tightly twisted together. This cable is installed in a common cable ally with 24 runs of CAT6a data and multiple RG-8a medium RF power coax lines. No crosstalk whatsoever! I Highly recommend the vendor and this cable.",
      "B09GHY1LM7 ★★★★☆ <b>Decent wire, but beware the differences of copper-clad aluminum VS pure copper</b> If you just need some wire that will carry far less than the normal rating for 14AWG wire, this will probably be fine. But it's important to note that copper clad aluminum has a lower current rating (higher resistance) than typical pure copper wire, so you shouldn't expect to be able to safely run 15-20A through this on a regular basis. It looks like nice wire, it's relatively flexible and has plenty of strands, and looks close to other 14AWG wire I have. Just make sure you're aware before you buy! I will probably need to find a different wire for the project I'm doing.",
      "B0C9H1G52F ★★★★★ <b>Pure copper, thick outer shielding</b> This wire is pure copper and not tinned so you get the best possible connection. The ZIP pull is tougher than normal to pull apart making it ideal for low voltage landscape lighting as it will not pull apart by it self. The outer coating of the wire is also very thick and being that it is UV and direct burial making this the best choice for my installation as I do have some wire exposed and buried. It is super flexible to go around corners and very easy to work with.",
      "B0CN316VHN ★★★★★ <b>Clean copper wire, verifies as true 16-gauge copper</b> I got this YOTIGER 16-gauge low-voltage copper pair wire to use for 12V lights in the house and car. It's pretty beefy and at 1A has less than 1V drop over the entire 100 feet. I had no problem stripping the wire and the copper is clean underneath. The roll didn't come with the inner end sticking out so I unrolled it all, drilled a larger hole so it would fit, then re-wrappped (poorly). The inner end could be connected to a power source to allow re-using the roll for temporary tasks needing power at a distance. I measured 3.4mm dia. insulation, 1.4mm dia. wire. Resistance over the whole roll (100 ft. x both directions) was 0.864 ohms, which works out to 4.32 ohms per 1000 ft (verified with LCR meter and running 2A current through it). Matches expected for 16-gauge copper stranded wire. I had to unroll all the wire to get at the other end as they don't poke it through the hole on the side of the spool.",
      "B000PANY2G ★★★★★ <b>Great price for 100% copper 14 guage wire</b> I verified that this is an all copper (not copper clad aluminum) stranded wire.

      "B0BZTW2XMN ★★★★★ <b>I like it</b> The copper wire construction of this landscape wire is a standout feature. Copper is known for its excellent conductivity and signal transmission properties, making it a superior choice for audio applications. I have noticed a significant improvement in the audio signal quality when using this wire for my speakers. The heavy-duty jacket of the wire is another commendable aspect. It provides reliable protection against tearing, cuts, and scrapes, ensuring the wire's longevity and performance even in challenging outdoor environments. I feel confident that the wire will withstand the test of time and maintain its signal integrity. The flexibility of the UBOORY landscape wire has been highly convenient. It is easy to work with and maneuver around tight corners or obstacles, making the installation process hassle-free. The flexibility of the wire also allows for neat and organized cable routing, ensuring a clean and professional-looking setup. Compared to copper-lined aluminum wires, this pure copper wire offers superior conductivity and flexibility. The enhanced conductivity results in a stronger audio signal, providing clearer and more vibrant sound quality. Additionally, the increased flexibility ensures that the wire can be easily routed without causing any signal loss or degradation. As I primarily use this wire for my speaker setup, I have been thoroughly impressed with its performance. The improved signal transmission and flexibility have elevated my audio experience, delivering rich and detailed sound output.",

Properly striped for +/- orientation (important for some LED installations), stranded copper, wire was easy to cut and split into separate wires for connections. Stripped well. All LED installation means I had very little amperage to carry so could use much thinner wire (higher gauge) and therefore decrease overall cost. Used this to run any split leg off of main run (12 gauge) and had no issues with any lights. Total main run was <100 ft. Each leg run was <40 ft.

The outer PVC insulation is thick but flexible and has very little coil memory once straightened. The 22 AWG stranded copper conductors are nicely tinned, and flows solder nicely. Both the outer jacket and wire insulation are easily stripped with a quality tool and I did not experience any issues with broken conductors. The black/red/yellow conductors are convenient for many applications that have power/ground/control requirements within the 300V 2.2A rating. The -40℃ to + 80℃ temperature range also make it suitable for most DIY projects. The 22 AWG conductors are perfect for DuPont connectors, which are convenient for jumper wires, electronic projects, and testing.",

The outer sheathing is really durable and flexible (as you can see in the picture). The inner sheathing around each individual wire strand is on the thinner side I thought. If you strip away the outer sheathing, I would definitely recommend using heat shrink or electrical tape to add a layer of protection to the inner sheathing. I wanted to see how this wire would do when it is cold, so I put the bundle in the freezer for an hour. It was obviously much stiffer when it was frozen, and it tended to hold its shape when bent; however even when it was frozen, the outer sheathing still allowed it to bend just as tightly as I showed in the one picture. The sheathing did not crack or discolor when it was frozen and bent this tightly. So I think that this wire will work well, even in cold-environment applications. Overall great bundle of wire, I plan to use it in an automotive application.",
      "B0CF55452S ★★★★☆ <b>Low voltage landscape copper wire</b> 16/2, 165ft - This is a competent product: labeling on the jacket says direct burial underground, and the insulation is relatively flexible at room temperature for stripping and bending. Stiffer in a colder outdoor environment. I did not measure the length to confirm advertised 165 ft though. Conductor appears to be pure copper strands, which is as claimed, not copper coated aluminum. The individual strands are quite fine. I counted 64 strands after stripping. Makes it very flexible and not likely to break after many and extreme bends. See photo. - Was easy to strip. - Actually the product seems fairly generic: there is no branding printed on the jacket nor any identification label on the roll. But you weren't expecting a mainstream brand anyhow, and it's just outdoor low voltage wire. It's fine. Looks like it will hold up in the garden. - One thing to keep in mind is that because it's bare copper wire (not tined, like marine wire) the connections are subject to corrosion from moisture and humidity. Make sure to use a connector method that either bonds the ends (solder) or creates a waterproof barrier to prevent this. - At the time I ordered the 16/2 165ft roll was $41, making it an okay deal, considering it's generic wire. - Hope this helps",
      "B0C65LQYPP ★★★★★ <b>Very Good Quality Wire</b> My favorite pastime is restoring old vehicles. I specifically ordered this wire because of the incased double red/black wires. I will be using this for running positive/negative wiring sets. In an old vehicle, wiring sets are a regular occurrence. I tested the outer casing by attempting to stretch it out of place. It held on very nicely. In my photos, I stripped back the inner wires to show the strands of copper wires. I really like this roll of wire.",
      "B01M22ZU7X ★★★★★ <b>Great Wire</b> I upgraded my garage lights from fluorescent to LED and needed custom wire lengths that exceeded the cables included with the new LED lights. This cable fit the bill. The wire gauge for the 500 ft roll appears to be true to size and the copper strands are of the size that allow for you to strip the insulation without the copper strands breaking. The white sleeve is also durable and appears to be able to feed-through without sustaining damage."

      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Great quality automotive & marine wire</b> This is perfect wire for automotive use, including campers and marine applications. The conductors are fine stranded, tinned copper, which is a thin protective coating on the copper to keep it from corroding in harsh environments such as ocean areas, or auto applications where winter road salting can cause problems. Despite what other reviewers have said, this is indeed copper wire, but the “tinning” process makes the wire appear silver unless you look at the cut end. It is typically used with crimp connectors in most applications. There is no indication that this wire is UL listed, so I would not use it for home-wiring applications or any 120 volt (or higher) AC current. The silicone insulation and fine stranding make this wire very flexible, so perfect for sharp turns and pulling through tight locations like behind the dash. The 14 gauge that I used is good for any circuits of up to 10 amps unless they are longer than 25 feet or so. Remember to calculate for both positive and negative lengths, and whether you can afford any voltage drop in your circuit. Circuits for an automotive refrigerator or fog lamps, which have extended use times for example, are different than a circuit for a horn, which is only used for a couple seconds at a time. This seems to be a very good quality and well manufactured wire, and is available in a wide variety of gauges, both red and black.",
      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Super flexible with extreme temperature rating</b> This wire uses solid tin-plated copper conductors and has a very high strand count for extreme flexibility. Although I don't see any voltage rating printed on the wire, the silicone insulation is quite thick compared to some other 16-gauge silicone wires that I have used. The outside diameter measures 3mm. The only markings on the wire are the gauge and the 200C (that's 392F) temperature rating. The ad does indicate a 600 volt insulation rating (but this is not marked) and gives a strand count of 252 @ 0.08mm. Of course with the silicone there is no insulation creep from soldering heat. This is good for RC work, and if you need a quantity the per/foot cost is much lower than hobby shop prices where you pay much more for a carded and packaged 3 or 6 foot length. Recommended.",

      "B0BY25MWGN ★★★★★ <b>Tinned for corrosion protection</b> This is a solid pair of good true 16 gauge wire. And it's tinned which I usually select for anything that I'm going to connect outdoors because tinned wire helps protect against corrosion and oxidation if you were only going to be inside in a dry location with your wiring it's not as necessary this and bear copper is just as conductive, but any where you're going to run into higher moisture levels or outdoors. I always pick tinned wire and lugs. Both rolls came out to just over 50 foot in length and they have good insulation on the wires. I'm using these to push 24 V at 5 A almost 50 foot which is still within their rating and no significant voltage drop so these are true 16 gauge.",

      "B0CK4WHWBY ★★★★★ <b>This is high quality wire with all the appropriate markings and ratings</b> This wire/cable seems to be quite a bit higher quality than some of the no-name 3-and 4-conductor bulk cable that I have been buying. The most significant thing that I noted right away is that although this has a PVC jacket it is significantly more compliant than some others that need to be uncoiled and back-bent to get the curlies out. This wire has a softer jacket that could be mistaken for rubber. It's almost as flexible as a professional microphone cable. Of course this doesn't matter a whole lot if you are burying it, but I have other uses where the flexibility is a plus. And of course with the heinous increase in the use of CCA (copper-clad aluminum), you now have to be careful what you buy. This wire is the good stuff - the individual strands are tin-plated solid copper. Highly recommended.",

      "B0CN768S54 ★★★★★ <b>AC & DC sides - Same Bat Cable, Same Bat Time</b> I like this wire. I like this companies products. I've now ordered this 16 Gauge, UL 2464 Tinned Copper Stranded Wire for LED Lighting in 3 different flavors. I got the 3 wire / conductor, the 5 wire, and now the 4 wire. The 5 wire is great for LEDs with a DC dimmer (AC - hot, neutral, ground & DC positive, negative for my dimmer switch). Boom! all done 1 cable. I got the 4 wire for my third LED high bay; I already had an available ground in the rafters next to the fixture. I ran the cable down and 2 AC wires (hot to toggle switch, neutral to neutral) & 2 wires for DC dimmer. Done. The 3 wire I used for my first High Bay - I had another two wire cable for the dimmer. I had to zip-tie those two together. The wire is - 16 gauge tinned copper - nice supple / pliable PVC insulated outside diameter is a spit bigger than 5/16\" (fits well in NPT3/8\" cable gland) . The Engineering Tool Box specs this wire at 6 amp carrying capacity up to 1000v @ 30 deg. C (86 F) ambient temperature. There is a .71 correction factor for temperatures between 41 - 45 deg. C (105 - 113 deg. F) So: 6(amps) x .71 = 4.26 4.26 amps is enough amperage for (3) 150w LED lamps. I'm using each cable for one fixture – I prefer to have the amperage up there for additions and the extra cost is minimal. I don't mind the extra cost for the marine rated tinned copper, but this company sells the same cable in the non-tinned flavor also. This is quality cable and makes for quick easy installations. I'll call that 5 Stars Thanks for Reading Tip: Don't get your crires wossed. Make a schematic – if you put AC power on the DC side your likely to fry your lamp.",

It’s tinned oxygen free copper and the insulation is silicone so it is incredibly flexible. I would recommend any of their products.",
      "B0BWY3JGGV ★★★★★ <b>Good stuff.</b> The wire inside is silver in color, but I believe that is because it is already tinned. However, it does make me concerned that this is aluminum wire and not copper. I used it for a wiring project on my car, extending the leads from a wiring harness that was too short. It worked beautifully for that. Aside from that the rolls are great - provide a wide assortment of colors, the insulation is good, and it is indeed 20AWG stranded wire. Worth the purchase price, IMHO.",

The silicone casing is both soft and resilient, indicative of quality silicone wire that can withstand a range of environmental factors. While the product claims the use of tinned copper as its conductive material, my efforts to verify this were inconclusive. Despite this, the wire does exhibit characteristics of high-quality conductor wire, including the appearance of a coppery color upon scraping. Given the uncertainty surrounding the confirmation of the tinned copper, I've decided to proceed with its use under the assumption that it meets the product description. The wire's overall feel and performance suggest it's up to the task for applications requiring high flexibility, temperature resistance, and reliability, such as automotive or battery connections. Considering its construction, usability, and the slight uncertainty regarding the material verification, I rate the Alienhomy 16 Gauge Silicone Wire 4 out of 5 stars. It stands as a solid choice for those in need of durable, high-temperature resistant wiring, with a minor reservation about the confirmation of its tinned copper content.",

For me, that's a great selling point and one of the reasons that I ordered this coil of wire. The short version of this review can be summed up in one word: perfect. The outer insulation of this wire strips easily with either a romex stripping tool or (shudder) a sharp knife. The individual conductors’ insulation can be removed almost as easily as it’s not bonded to the surface of the copper conductor. Thankfully the conductors themselves are solid copper wire and not copper clad aluminum otherwise known as CCA. And for a bit more icing on the cake, this coil of Arizona Electrical Solutions wire costs less than half of what the same length coil of wire in the big box stores near me costs. And in case 25 feet of 14 gauge wire is not what you need for your next project, this company also sells other gauges and lengths here on Amazon. And again, it's made in America.

I bought this product as I only needed about 15' to finish a project - the length was right and was far cheaper then anything else I found online or in store (HD, CTC, HH - Canada). UL rating should be fine in Canada. 1st - this wire is a much lighter wire and insulation then what should be the equivalent 12/2 NMWU. 2nd - the ground wire is molded into the sheathing making it difficult to separate and strip your hot and neutral wires (black, white). 3rd - this wire feels more rigid then 12/2 NMWU, making me wonder about copper content. And finally, this wire is rated for 600 V where 12/2 NMWU is rated for 300 V (as is 14/2 NMD90) - this does NOT change the Amperage rating. - so not sure why. Above is 14/2 NMD90 (top), UF-B 12/2 (middle) and 12/2 NMDU (bottom). I don't know if this is standard in the US, but as noted in previous review, the 25' seems inadequate.",

For bodging and wrapping electronic projects, it is better to have thinner insulation ... the jacket on this wire is exceptionally thick for the gauge.

The outer black sheath is smooth and feeds well through conduit without lubrication. The product is priced very well if you think you are buying top quality copper conductor cable. The cons: This is really lousy cable. The conductors are supposed to be 23 AWG but the box I received measured below 24 AWG. The individual wires are brittle and break easily. So easily in fact that it was almost impossible to terminate in an RJ-45 plug. After spending hours placing this cable through walls and attic space, testing revealed there was a break somewhere along the cable. Makes perfect sense. Just manipulating the twisted pair to straighten for termination would cause at least one of the eight conductors to snap off. I have terminated lots of twisted pair cable and this was by far the most difficult to work with. Also, the product title does not indicate this is copper coated aluminum (CCA) cable wire.",

The wire is just a (very) little bit stiffer than what I would expect with full copper stranded but the difference is very minimal and could also be due to the wire sheathing as well. Also, these two are being stored in an unheated garage which could be adding to the stiffness. I’m planning on using the wire for auto and trailer wiring.",

      "B0CH2R3XNH ★★★★☆ <b>Copper Clad * ALUMINUM * for maybe 10 amps</b> This product sort of tricked me. I saw 12/2 wire and I’m just so used to everything being copper that I didn’t notice this listing is for CCA (Copper Clad Aluminum). That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but if - like me - you see 12 AWG and have a knee jerk expectation this can carry twenty amps then you’re going to be disappointed. That said, you don’t normally need that kind of amperage in a low voltage system anyway. What tipped me off was measuring the resistance. When I join the two ends of this roll to get a 240-ft loop, I measure 1.0 ohms (after subtracting out 0.1 for my test leads). That’s about double what I’d expect from 12 AWG copper, and puts it more in the neighborhood of 16 AWG copper. So we’re looking at wire here that can carry something in the neighborhood of ten amps — assuming you have enough voltage to even make that happen. This is a consideration that I don’t see mentioned in the product listing at the time of this writing. And that’s probably fine for most garden lighting projects (up to maybe 100W, hopefully not all going down one wire). LED lights these days really don’t use a whole lot of power. So if this product meets your needs then by all means go for it. I see nothing to complain about in terms of build quality and fully expect it to survive direct burial operation. I just want to make sure you’re not under-sizing your wire. And, just to be clear, this wire is for low voltage applications. If you’re looking to carry line voltage without running conduit then you probably want UF-B wire instead and there are rules about how deep you have to bury it (usually one foot at the very least — and that’s assuming you have ground fault protection).",

Good: - Comes on a spool and is tidy for easy removal and use. - Has length markings every foot, counting down from 100' so you know how much you have left. Nice! - Sheath material easy to work with and strip, as are the wires themselves. Bad: - The listing shows \"CL2/CL3 rated\". Well which is it? Neither the spool or the wire say anything about the rating, except for the spool which mentions 12 and 24 volts DC. No amperage given, which is possibly to be expected for speaker wire. - Additionally the listing mentions Direct Bury, which again, is not listed on the wire or spool. It has no filling in the sheath, and looks like no direct bury wire I have ever used. I am skeptical. - Frankly the overall lack of assurance that the wire is rated as it says it is in the listing is a problem for me. NOW IF it is indeed as the listing claims, then this is pretty nice two conductor wire and a good deal. Know what you are getting, and if it matches your need.

      "B07DY7PT24 ★★★☆☆ <b>buy from home depot instead</b> Just realized it was CCA copper clad aluminum and not solid copper wire. lol. I wired my house, exterior and interior, a couple of years ago with this cable. We've been through two winters in the PNW with a couple weeks of snow each time and it has worked great. But now that I know it's CCA, looking back I would have opted for solid copper. I will be wiring another house but will be buying solid copper CAT5e from Home Depot instead because it's for someone else and I'd like to minimize any issues that might arise in the future. Home Depot has both indoor and outdoor bulk CAT5e cable. It's not as expensive as I thought it was going to be at Home Depot. I'm willing to pay a little extra for some peace of mind. Now I'm interested in running LAN speedtests to see what kind of speeds we're actually getting at home. If you end up buying this cable anyways, and specially if installing cable for someone else, I would highly recommend getting a decent cable tester like the ELEGIANT RJ11 RJ45 Cable Tester B01HCQSHNG. I would not recommend this cable for people who use their internet to work from home because it can turn into a troubleshooting nightmare if your internet connection starts dropping occasionally / sporadically. I would only recommend this cable for temporary solutions or people who have spare time to troubleshoot their network if an issue arises and have no problem re-terminating or re-running a wire. p.s. I've loved using 4.5mm saddle brackets B01NBLP9RU + exterior screws + zip ties to tie down cables, specially if running outdoors or more than one cable along the same path. sturdiest setup I've come across.",

      "B07GH7JHG9 ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Beware of Copper Clad Aluminum Wire!</b> When shopping for Cat5e or Cat6 network cables, make sure you are comparing apples to apples. One of the most common tactics of the “low cost leaders” is to use aluminum instead of copper wire. This can lead to network issues from using inferior materials to transmit the signal. Looking to cut costs, manufacturers started using aluminum wire dipped in a thin coating of copper. This technique created an aluminum core cable surrounded by a thin layer of copper. The performance and safety of CCA cables are radically different. In fact, aluminum network cables violate TIA and IEC standards for Cat5e and Cat6 cables. CCA cable has higher attenuation than pure copper cables. This results in a greater loss of data, as packets have to be re-transmitted. The more data that is re-transmitted, the slower your network performs. Plus, these problems are compounded by every foot of cable you use; the longer the cable, the worse the performance. CCA cables also have a 55% higher DC resistance. This increases the amount of energy that is transferred into heat and reduces the amount of power that can be transferred. This issue makes them unusable for power over Ethernet (PoE) devices like IP cameras and phones. These cut corners also affect installers because aluminum wire creates installation issues. Due to the lower tensile strength, aluminum cables can be damaged when being pulled. Single conductors can break, making the cable useless, or the whole cable can snap. Aluminum also has a lower bend radius than pure copper cables. This means you can’t bend it as much before it fails. In short, spend the extra money on solid core copper cable.",
      "B07DY7PT24 ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Here is my opinion as an engineer</b> Thinner than I expected, I was in shock after a 1 hour of installation right doing the RG45 connectors, this can't be happenings, the cable pairs are so thin and flimsy.

The outer insulation of this wire strips easily with either a romex stripping tool or (shudder) a sharp knife. The individual conductors’ insulation can be removed almost as easily as it’s not bonded to the surface of the copper conductor. Thankfully the conductors themselves are solid copper wire and not copper clad aluminum otherwise known as CCA. And for a bit more icing on the cake, this coil of Arizona Electrical Solutions wire costs less than half of what the same length coil of wire in the big box stores near me costs.

Cost is always a consideration when working on projects. What is CCA wire? It’s a copper cladded aluminum wire, meaning that the outer layer is coated with copper while the inner core is aluminum. How does CCA work? The copper clad aluminum isn’t going to have the same conductive or durable performance as a pure copper, but it is pretty good. What’s to like? For non mission critical projects, the advantage of a CCA wire is cost as it is less than the cost of pure copper. What’s not to like? It’s not as durable and it has a higher resistance than pure copper. In conclusion, if you’re working on lots of non mission critical low voltage projects, the CCA wires can be a great cost saving while still getting decent performance.

      "B0CLBHT8YX ★★★★☆ <b>Good for small projects</b> It seems I'm always scrounging for sections of wire on different RV projects and usually find something leftover from an older finished project that works but maybe is not the best (such as by adding pigtails). This has 5 fifty foot rolls of 5 colors that should end the scrounging. This is a copper clad aluminum core (CCA) wire. The copper reduces corrosion caused by moisture and oxidation and adds surface conductivity. I got it to use for some small 12V wiring projects in the RV (additional 12 volt computer fan for gas refrigerator cooling) and to have on hand when I just need some short lengths of wire. For reference, Cu Clad Al (CCA) wire can be used for main wire projects but at a much larger gauge as aluminum has a higher resistance than copper. 12 AWG is recommended for a 15 Amp 110V circuit and 10 AWG for a 20 Amp. This is a 36 strand 16 AWG braided wire so it's not made for heavy loads or 110 volt wiring. Specs are for up to 80 volts. The wire is flexible and there's enough copper coating for it to solder easily to itself. If there's trouble having the wire stick, a copper infused solder works. I used some lead free Rosin Core 2.0 Sn99 Ag0.3 Cu0.7 electronics solder and everything was sucked into the wire and stuck together. I couldn't find the percent by weight of copper anywhere on the rolls, package, or website. The range for CCA is anywhere from 10% to 24% by weight, with the more the better (but also more expensive). 15 small zip ties and 10 heat shrink tubes are included in the box. I'm never going to use this on a main AC wiring project but for small electrical projects, it's a good economical choice and should last a long time. If you don't want 5 colors and a dispenser box, 4-color roll packages of 100'/roll 16AWG of this brand are the same price if you shop around. 4 stars - copper specs not given.",

You can use it to power low-mid power stereo equipment (probably would go bigger for over 1k watts). Use it to run new circuits on the interior like a few more 12v power points or USB chargers for phones, powering 12V displays or really anything on the interior of the vehicle. You can use it for other automotive needs but I would use a sleeve for anything under the hood or tucked into the undercarriage.

      "B01C7O8166 ★★★★★ <b>Honest Seller, will buy again</b> For sure will buy from this seller again. They do advertise it as CCA, copper clad aluminum, and I unfortunately verified that by cutting into the wire when stripping it. However it is advertised as 10 gauge (they are very adamant that this wire does not conform to AWG spec and will not advertise it as AWG), but it fits perfectly into a 12ga/AWG ferrule. I looked around reviews both for this one and the 12gauge variant and all around I saw that the 12ga wire that they sell is actually more like 14ga/AWG size and the 10ga size is more like 12ga/AWG size. The outer diameter is probably 10ga but the inner is for sure very close to 12AWG. Pure copper for the same length would be like 2-4x the price, but a safe assumption would be that CCA holds 80% of pure copper amperage (since aluminum has 70% of the conductance of copper, but I add in roughly 10% cause there is a copper layer on top). Say if 10AWG pure copper holds 30 amps between 12-80V DC, then CCA wire of the same cross directional size would probably safely hold ~24 amps or less (<21 amps) if you hold CCA wire as the same conductance as pure aluminum and believe the copper layer is just for show. Just know what you're buying and your tolerances. Overall, very good for your low budget, low amperage needs.",

      "B0CKTBGCXV ★★★★☆ <b>12 gauge speaker wire does the trick</b> We've used this 50 foot roll of HiFind double 12 gauge electrical wire on several projects, include a short run for high powered speakers and to repair a 12 volt lamp. It's aluminum with copper clad construction ( a thin copper coating), so less expensive than pure copper and nearly as good for our purposes, for less than 50 cents per foot. As seen in the photos, this 50 foot coil of wire did not come on a spool. Not a bad product, would purchase again.",
      "B0B5DSNSFX ★★★★★ <b>If you do wiring on trucks and heavy equipment, this is the wire you need for high current loads.</b> This is high quality, 10 gauge, stranded copper clad aluminum wire. It has the ampacity to supply high current draw loads like spotlights, electric hoists, electric brakes, and winches. The insulation’s PVC jacket makes it impervious to rain and snow. At approximately 25 cents a foot, it is very affordable, even for the most budget minded. The copper cladding makes it easy to solder, quick and clean joints every time. The 100 foot rolls make it easy to carry and work with, even in the field where you may be working on your back on the ground.",

Overall, I am very happy with this cable. It’s heavy duty and easy to work with. You can tell that the pairs are soft (aluminum clad) versus the solid cable cable, but I have not ran into issues. It actually makes straightening the cables easy. I did not find the cable to be brittle as some reviews complained. I used the cable directly buried around my 6 acres for IP cameras. The cable is very light. And....floats. Which, really shouldn’t matter but it was an observation I made. This will probably be my go-to heavy duty Cat6 cable.",

      "B09CG2S2P2 ★★★★☆ <b>Great Lightweight Wire</b> This Cablectric 4 Roll 12 Gauge Copper Clad Aluminum Primary Wire came in four bright colors. It is lightweight and doesn't qualify for use as the wiring in a house and isn't rated to be used outdoors. I wonder why they say it is good for marine usage if it can't be used outdoors. All I can figure is it may be used if concealed from the weather, such as under the sides of a boat or inside a houseboat. It wouldn't be acceptable for a boat trailer, however, as the wires are exposed to the elements there. We chose to use the wire for the new speaker system for our television. My adult son and I live together and he wired the speakers. He said it was very easy with this wire as it stripped easily and didn't break any when he wrapped the ends around the terminals. I have to take his word for this as I certainly don't know anything about it!! Next, he plans to rewire the LED lights under our countertops. They don't carry enough current to count as house wiring. All in all, this is great wire for general use. It is nice to have available for things that may pop up. Who knows, I may have a need for some brightly colored wire for a craft project, too!! At this writing, it is only about $30 for 100 feet of wire, so it is very reasonable. I do recommend it!!",

Made of copper clad aluminum (CCA), it offers the conductivity of copper with the lightweight properties of aluminum, making it flexible and cost-effective. The PVC insulation ensures durability, flexibility, and resistance to aging, moisture, and corrosion, with an operating temperature range of -20°C to 70°C. The 100ft length provides ample wiring for various projects, and the two-color jacket allows for easy polarity differentiation, reducing the risk of device damage due to incorrect polarity. Overall, this wire is convenient, durable, and offers excellent value for money, making it a practical choice for anyone in need of reliable electrical wiring.",

This 6 pack became available on Vine so I decided to get it as it will probably last me a very long time being as each roll is 100'. The wire seems to be pretty decent. It is copper clad aluminum which isn't the best according to some but for automotive applications I've found it to be perfectly acceptable. This shouldn't be used in residential applications and the manufacturer notes it right on its ad, but for other less critical projects will be fine.

I was able to run most of it underground, so it stays hidden very well. Music quality sounds great and I have no complaints. 14 ga. wire is perfect for my application. The wire is CCA which means it is aluminum wire covered in copper with copper being the better conductor. That is fine with me, as pure 14 ga. copper would probably be 3x as expensive. It is also cable rated to be run in walls."

The wire is super flexible due to the silicone insulation and the multi-strand wire. The wire solders easily though the twisted strands should be tinned before soldering. I twisted the strands and crimped 16 ga. connectors. The twisted wires fit the connectors and crimped properly. I could not pull the connection apart. It would have been nice to have had a hole in the spool to keep the wire from de-reeling, but an 11/64 drill bit took care of that. The seller specs the current rating at 20 amps-600 volts AC. 16 ga. wire in 12VDC applications ranges from 8 to 10 amps depending on length, and 13 amps in AC applications.",
      "B0CN2RB68V ★★★★★ <b>Great wire set for low voltage applications</b> Ordered this wire to use in some repair work on my old car. The gauge is appropriate and the wire inside the sheathing is stranded and seems fine. Overall happy with the wire for my application.",
      "B07CWQ6JPB ★★★★★ <b>Decent Wire</b> Basically you're getting a total of 200' of wire, one black and one red. It's attached if needed or can be separated with a quick snip and pull. The stranded wire is tinned which is an excellent feature at this price point. You can see my pictures as to the quality. After a quick strip I soldered for effect. Excellent solder connection with no issues. Yeah, yeah, it's made in China. Go ahead, try to find US made stranded copper wire AND tinned at this price. I triple dog dare you.",
      "B0BKPBRFF2 ★★★★★ <b>Exactly as advertised.</b> This wire is so specific about what it is that it's just self-explanatory. It's stranded wires rather than one thick piece of copper inside, which allows you to bend and move the wire a whole lot easier. The jacket is black and feels like silicone or rubber. Decent twenty-five-foot length. Neither end comes pre-stripped, so you'll need to strip it yourself when it's time to install. Very nice quality wire.",
      "B0CKTBGCXV ★★★★★ <b>Stranded Wire</b> I ordered 75' of 14 gauge speaker wire. The wire is indeed stranded, thickly insulated, and very flexible. This will easily work with longer runs or larger speakers without issues. The two wires are easy to separate and strip. Overall this seems like a solid choice worth considering.",
      "B0CK4WHWBY ★★★★★ <b>Heavy Duty</b> This is really nice wire. Stranded copper already tinned making it easy to solder. The jacketing is flexible yet really durable. Took a couple passes with the wire strippers to get it through the outer jacketing. The inner wires jacketing was also thick. You can easily see that this wire can handle being buried if needed. The 18 gauge can also handle quite a bit of current if running lighting (or even speakers). Little on the expensive side...but keep in mind that this cable is made for outdoors and/or direct burial and that is definitely what you are getting for you money. If you need to run a cable outdoors, do yourself a favor and get the right wire to do the job. Nothing worse than trying to save money only to have something short (or catch fire) on something cheaper. This is worth the price for what it does...",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Great assortment of high quality tinned copper wire</b> This is an excellent multi-color assortment of silicone-insulated 16 gauge copper stranded wire. It is made of tinned copper strands, which protects it from oxidation. The tin coating makes it look like aluminum wire, but it is not. One easy test is to strip some, twist it, then wiggle it back and forth a number of times. If it's aluminum wire it will start falling apart in your fingers, but this wire does not. This wire also accepts solder very readily. The silicone insulation stands up to flames without melting, and is super flexible. This is great wire for hobbies like radio control, and other applications where the wires are subjected to movement, and heat. Highly recommended! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
      "B07F111X9J ★★★★☆ <b>Stranded wire is very fine. Difficult to twist and remain twisted.</b> I am not sure what the best application for this very fine stranded wire could be used for. It is very flexible. attaching connectors would be a consideration.",

The resulting cross-cut area is approximately 4.374 square millimeters. After adjusting for an equivalent solid cross-cut section by reducing spaces between strands (around 27.3%), it should be around 3.18 square millimeters. When compared to the expected cross-cut section for standard 12 AWG solid wiring, which is 3.31 square millimeters, this wire fulfills approximately 96% of the anticipated standard section.",

      "B0CKTBGCXV ★★★★★ <b>Works</b> Somebody online said that for long runs you should use 14 rather than 12 gauge wire. I have tried both and maybe my runs were too short to notice, but either seemed to work. These are thick connected wire meshes of copper super-thin wires. The red and black are easily parted by intentional effort, but stuck well enough that you won't lose integrity on accident. It worked for me on an old Yamaha sound system and I used the rest for hanging pictures and a pinata.",
      "B0981NF1HV ★★★★☆ <b>Good for clean guitar wiring.</b> Might be 22ga. Feels more like 24ga. You need to tin it, because although each individual strand of wire it tinned, all strands together are not. Solders well. Decent wire for low voltage applications like guitar wiring.",
      "B0CK4WHWBY ★★★★★ <b>Reliable and Durable Outdoor Wiring Solution</b> One of the standout features is its robust construction. The wire is encased in a flexible PVC jacket that not only makes it durable but also ensures it is waterproof, oil-proof, and UV-resistant. This is a crucial aspect for outdoor installations, providing peace of mind that the wire can withstand various weather conditions without compromising its integrity. The 18-gauge thickness is perfect for low voltage applications, such as LED lighting and automotive speakers. The stranded design adds flexibility, making it easy to work with and allowing for smooth installations even in tight spaces. Additionally, the direct burial capability is a notable advantage, eliminating the need for conduit in certain situations. I found the cable easy to strip and terminate, making the installation process straightforward. The overall build quality instills confidence in its longevity, and I appreciate the attention to detail in its design. In summary, the 18 Gauge Electrical Wire has proven to be a reliable and durable solution for outdoor lighting projects. Its waterproof and UV-resistant properties, combined with the flexibility of the stranded design, make it an ideal choice for anyone seeking a high-quality cable for low voltage landscape lighting and other outdoor applications.",

      "B0CG1GSW3P ★★★★★ <b>Very nice 10 AWG stranded copper core wire!</b> I'm using this for RV wiring, from deep cycle batteries to high power LED flood lights, solar, water pump, etc. The seller doesn't appear to be overstating anything. The wire is flexible, stranded, copper (each strand is tinned) and should have no issues meeting the power and temperature specs. 10 gauge is far more than most people will need for most basic RV wiring, but if you aren't sure, check with an electrician. I added pictures of the strands, before and after applying high heat. Note, the end of the strands ball up, which is a trait of copper, not aluminum. The tinning is easily burned from the wire to show the copper core. This is good stuff, actually great, considering what I see as the price of around 34 bucks. I'm pleasantly surprised!",
      "B0BXKLS2T4 ★★★★★ <b>Was exactly what I hoped for</b> Lots of thin conductors, very flexible.

      "B0C65LQYPP ★★★★★ <b>Good quality low-voltage wire</b> This is good quality low-voltage wiring. I think it is intended for speaker wiring which is what I originally intended to use it for. But I ended up using this for some outdoor 12V landscaping lights. You don't really need the individual wire color coding for that application, but this worked out perfectly well for me. Seems like the stranding is well done, it does not break when bent. And it is designed to be used outdoors as it is waterproof. However, keep the ends well protected from rain and snow. Just because the cable is water proof means that the connectors and copper is waterproof, so keep your ends/connections dry. This was a good price and it works very well for my purposes. I imagine I could find any number of users for this including LED lighting.",
      "B07RRPFSZ1 ★★★★★ <b>Silicone wire - love this stuff!</b> I really like the flexibility of the wire. I did note that the strands are not copper but a silver or another metal.

Comes with caps over the wire ends for protection. For the 6 wire, colors are red, black, yellow, blue, white and green. Overall diameter is slightly larger than expected for non-shielded. But I think it has to do with the insulation of both the individual wires and the overall. Not sure what is and isn't allowed but I'm planning to use this for some hardwired sensors and a 5V line. Looks good.",

The wire is also stranded tinned OFC copper. Good stuff. As an Engineer, the only thing that stands out to me as incortrect in the description is the 36 amp rating. That isn't right - or safe. Yes, it may carry 36 amps for a while but it's going to get real hot and at some point fail or start a fire - silicone jacket or not. Here in the U.S. Code requires the use of 10 gauge wire for 30 amps. Any load on this 12 gauge wire that exceeded 20-22 amps would fail inspection. Keep that in mind when using this. Safety first, right? All that said, this IS really good wire and I'm glad I got it.",

That gives a area of wire of 0.276 square mm and places it between 22 AWG and 23 AWG. An 18 AWG wire has a area of 0.823 square mm, considerably larger. This wire has much less current carrying capacity and if a buyer uses it expecting the current carrying capacity of an 18 AWG wire a serious over heat/fire could be the result.

      "B01KWBPC7M ★★★★★ <b>Very decent wire. In depth review & Pics</b> Running some permanent LED strips in the living room vaulted ceiling. Needed wire to run through the attic from the LED strips to a controller about 22 feet away. Wanted something heavier than the 22 gauge wire you find everywhere, and I wanted 100 foot spool Those two combinations limited what was out there. Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white). Even with my current strips, would have been nice to be able to upgrade without having to re-run wire. Oh well, happy anyway!",

The Bad: Nothing. These are good cables if they fit your needs. I suggest ferrules or tinning the ends. The stranded wires are extremely thin. Tinning is easy, but takes a little flux and a LOT of solder because the tiny strands soak it up so fast. These wires will take solder, no problem at all.

Actually, here is a fun fact. because it is stranded it is able to carry more current than the solid gauge wire. I’m not about to go and unravel this whole thing just to measure if they gave 50ft but based on what I am seeing, that appears to be the case. I like this wire, I know it will be useful in the future. I plan to use it to wire some outdoor lights in the sun room at my park model when it opens up again for the season. Upon inspection of the wire it appears brand new and there are no signs of damage anywhere on the wire. I’m not sure why this wire is tinned because generally you would utilize screw on caps in order to secure the junction between two wires in a home rough in environment. Or at least that is how electricians do it so maybe there is a use I am not aware of. Therefore, I would recommend this wire as it is good quality and the listing order is exactly as described.",
      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★☆ <b>Decent silicone wire, nice dispensing box. Came with strippers and shrink wrap</b> Decent budget friendly stranded wire with silicone cover.

      "B0CF55452S ★★★★☆ <b>pretty good cable</b> This seems to be a reasonably well made cable. The wires are stranded wires...a set of two. By appearance (just for reference) this would look similar to like a lamp cord with 2 stranded conductors. This however seems to be significantly thicker insulation making it durable for outdoor use. Decent solid cable.",
      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Excellent hookup wire with heat resistant insulation</b> Occasionally there are wiring situations where heat may play a factor, such as when running power to an installation in a car. The wire may run past a heated surface or it may just get exposure to the heat that can buildup on a sunny day. For those occasions Silicone coated wire is essential, this one is rated to 390F. I also like it for test equipment and a host of other uses where high flexibility is needed. This wire is multistranded and 20AEWG is a good size for general purposes. It appears to be good quality and shows no magnetic sensitivity so it is hopefully pure copper as stated. Recommended.",

      "B0CV7XSN9H ★★★★★ <b>Fantastic Quality - Long Lasting, Weather Proof, Well Insulated, Good Conductor.</b> 16 Gauge, 6 Conductor Stranded Tinned Copper Electrical Wire 25FT by ENERJOUR The Wires The individual insulated wires are exposed 4 inches on each end of the cable. But NOT bare like the pictures show. This is good because you can strip them like you need them. The Weight It seems a bit heavy, but how could it not be, that’s a lot of thick insulated wires in a cable. The Quality This cable and the wires in it are all smooth and strong. It all really looks like it will last a long time. Advice The best stripper I ever used was the Klein Tools Katapult. It’s got 5 stars out of over 9,000 reviews. I very much wish I had one of these a long time ago.",

The current price of ~$66 is reasonable. LIKES: - Great quality for low voltage uses. - Good temperature profile. - Tinned copper. - Working well for connecting 2 buildings for a low voltage application. DISLIKES: - The individual copper wires sort of float inside of the outer protective plastic sheath. This leaves a somewhat sloppy appearance.",

      "B0CBMZGNFL ★★★★★ <b>This is a nice tinned copper 14-gauge 2-conductor cable.</b> This is a nice cable with two 14-gauge conductors and in a round sheathing. The copper is tinned and appears to be true to size, based on my stripping and crimping tools. The wire is rated at 80 degrees Celsius instead of my preferred 105 degrees but should be sufficient for most uses. Recommended!",
      "B0CGQ29J9Q ★★★★★ <b>Perfect for outdoor speaker wire.</b> I like listening to music when I’m outside working in the yard. I move a column speaker outside and connect it to a small PA amp. The flexible KWANGIL 16 AWG wire makes this process much easier than the stiffer 18 AWG speaker wire that I had previously been using. As an added bonus, this wire is UV stable and also tinned to protect it from corrosion. And the tinned wire is super easy to solder. KWANGIL even supplies the coil with an end cap on each wire end to keep the wire in perfect condition until it’s ready to be used. The 20 feet of wire is supplied wound in a ~7 ½ inch coil and packaged in a sealed plastic bag. Thanks to the large size of the coil, when the wire is unwrapped it lays fairly flat unlike wire that has been tightly coiled. Stripping the outer jacket was just as easy as the listing said it would be. I stripped 4 inches from one end with no problem. Stripping the individual wires on the other hand isn’t as easy. The insulation on each wire is tight but that also keeps moisture away. Stripping ½ inch took a bit of work, stripping 1 inch I found easiest to do in two ½ inch pieces. The wire works great with the speaker and is easy to coil when I’m ready to put the speaker away.",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Practical kit for small wiring jobs</b> This is a convenient set of wire for small automotive or hobby projects. The wire is tinned copper, and I exposed the copper with a grinder to be sure of the copper. The tinning makes the actual wire appear silver and protects against corrosion. Very flexible and finely stranded, so it is easy to pull and route where needed and various colors for identification according to your needs. 14 gauge is typical for 15 amps or less in relatively short distances like a vehicle, and the silicone insulation is both durable and well suited for applications where moisture, oils or dirt may be encountered. Also comes with an assortment of wire ties. Note that this is not manufactured or or suitable for use in house wiring, nor is it UL Listed. Overall, a nice selection of quality wire at a reasonable price.",
      "B01KOEZ498 ★★★☆☆ <b>Not silicone, 1007 PVC, but is tinned copper inside - check it for yourself.</b> No longer silicone, it is 1007 PVC jacketed. The core is tinned copper. These folks saying it’s not copper are ignorant. Take a lighter to the jacket and it will smolder but to solder with this is a breeze. The tin over copper is useless to me but once you melt the tin off what do you have?? Orange copper boys. Just check out the weight compared to a length of copper wire of the same gauge and aluminum of the same gauge. I have weighed this wire and it matches weight by foot of similarly selected copper core wire. Unfortunately I DID order silicone jacket and this is pvc but it seems like good enough stuff to keep around. I’ll just get the thinner gauge stuff with silicone jackets from their website. This company has a decent product.",

It comes in a plastic zip-top bag, and there is a small roll of electrical tape and what appears to be a screwdriver. I bought this to connect 4 Ohm bookshelf speakers to my 50W-per-channel stereo amp, and it works fine. The Gerilik cable's jacket is more robust than standard speaker wire, making it overkill for my application. However, I like the look and appreciate the added protection. It's worth mentioning that this \"general purpose\" wire is not rated for in-wall use.",
      "B0CRYX1P5T ★★★★★ <b>Quality hookup wire.</b> This 12 gauge wire comes on a small spool and in a cardboard box. There are 2 conductors and the wire has a silicone jacket. The wire is also stranded tinned OFC copper. Good stuff. As an Engineer, the only thing that stands out to me as incortrect in the description is the 36 amp rating. That isn't right - or safe. Yes, it may carry 36 amps for a while but it's going to get real hot and at some point fail or start a fire - silicone jacket or not. Here in the U.S. Code requires the use of 10 gauge wire for 30 amps. Any load on this 12 gauge wire that exceeded 20-22 amps would fail inspection. Keep that in mind when using this. Safety first, right? All that said, this IS really good wire and I'm glad I got it.",
      "B0CNXJ9H6Q ★★★★★ <b>100% copper wire</b> The tinning on this wire protects the copper wire from oxidation, which makes it perfect for outdoor use. Don't bother with CCA (copper clad aluminum) wire because not only do the strands break very easily, it does not hold up very well when exposed to moisture because it corrodes very quickly. If you've ever had wiring on a trailer fail on you without any signs of physical damage, most likely it was made out of CCA wire. Tinned copper wire is my preferred choice to use on trailer wiring because it'll withstand being exposed to the elements.",

It's great for wiring split wired landscape lighting, which is what I use it for most of the time.",
      "B0CN9FNFZC ★★★★★ <b>Nice well made cable</b> Nice highly flexible 18 gage wire. It is tinned, so if you plan to solder, that is even better. I am using this as a signal wire from remote/pendant mounted switches to control small relays. For this, it is well suited, possibly a little overkill. But I like having a little heavier gage than what it takes just to get the job done. In my experience, it lasts longer and more forgiving to unexpected issues and faults. The outer sheath is not terribly difficult to cut, but I do not think average use will cause damage to it. Probably not suited to use in a manufacturing plant where it would be subjected to many types of abuse. But for the average DIY home entrepreneur, it would likely be just fine. I think we all take better care of things when it is us who foot the bill to pay for them. The individual wires are color coded (think thermostat wire), so they are easily identifiable on each end. As mentioned they are tinned, so the are easily soldered as well. I like soldered connections. They are more trouble to install, but, when properly done, I feel they are extremely reliable and with lower resistance due to more surface contact area. Soldering is not always an option, but these wires will do just fine when crimped as well.",
      "B0BYNNJS8B ★★★★☆ <b>Good Quality But Not As Flexible As I Had Hoped</b> This is good quality wire at a reasonable price. The 18 gauge I ordered appears to contain 24 tinned copper strands and it takes solder well. While the product description lists it as “flexible”, I found it to retain its shape much more than I expected for which I knocked off one star. That said, unless you really need ultimate flexibility, this is a good option at a solid price point.",
      "B07111R7N8 ★★★★★ <b>FOR CAR AUDIO PEOPLE…</b> I was looking for copper tinned lugs for my car audio build. I usually buy my lugs directly from sky high car audio, but I was in a bit of a money pinch so $10 for a pack of 10 didn’t seem that worth it at the time. I ended up coming across these bad boys, which happened to be the best deal around. 50 lugs for less than $40. Honestly I was pretty hyped. I ended up remember that car audio 1/0 is not standard 1/0 welding wire. It’s actually oversized 1/0…so right in between 1/0-2/0. I decided to go for the 2/0 lugs and purchased 50 of them. I tested it out on 1/0 sky high wire and it fit like a GLOVE. The 2/0 lug itself is smaller than sky high 1/0 lug, which was kinda nice because I am working on tight space. I did try the 2/0 lug on some sky high 2/0 and there’s no chance it would go in. Maybe if you force a ton, but even then it won’t work. I couldn’t even get the head of the wire in and these lugs are flared outwards too. I haven’t crimped them yet but I will soon, I’ll update the review when I get to crimping stage. But as of now, they get a 5/5 for fitting oversized 1/0 car audio wire. Update 3/6/22: crimping is absolutely awesome. I have two types of crimpers, hydraulics and handheld $30 crimpers from amazon. I decided to use the handheld crimper, even though it doesn't go up to 2/0 size. Stuck it on the 1/0 setting and did 2 crimps at the bottom and top of the lug. Had my dad pull one end of the wire while I held the lug end of the wire. We both pulled as hard as we could and it didn't even move. I'd say they work as intended.",

      "B09XQWWPD2 ★★★★★ <b>Good gauge wire at a great price</b> This is nice wire for speakers or solar connections. At first glance the wire looked to be a smaller gauge than it is but I have been looking at larger gauge wire the last couple of days. The wire clearly states 14AWG on the insulation. This is all tinned copper wire and designed for low voltage like car wiring. You get 50’ of both the black and red insulated wire. That is a great price, probably half of what I have seen wire selling for. The wire has good flexibility and has a good feel in your hands. This should be able to carry sufficient amperage for most of your 12-volt lighting or speaker need as long as the distance is not too long. I would not recommend this for running a winch or anything that has a very heavy draw.",

This wire (#22) has insulation that is slightly thicker than some PVC insulations but not a lot thicker. Its easy to strip the insulation but its not so soft that it tears or can be crushed off the wire easily - I've had silicone insulation that was just to fragile and this is perfect - The slightly tougher insulation is slightly stiffer but its a much better compromise for applications where the wiring won't be completely protected in a sleeve - even inside an enclosure, some of them are too easily damaged and this holds up well. Colors are very solid/bright - no issues there The conductor is very finely stranded and individually tinned strands - very nice construction and easy to work with. Seems like very nice wire - good combination of insulation and stranding and easy to identify colors - nice little kit of spools.",

I did not unroll to make sure it is 100 ft, but since I only need a foot here and there, if it's off, I don't really mind. Oh, and it also came with a roll of electrical tape and a what appears to be a single-pole voltage presence detector with a phillips tip, which makes it difficult to use.

      "B0CV7XP7JN ★★★★★ <b>3 Flavors - Taste the Same to Me</b> I like this wire. I like this companies products. I've now ordered this 16 Gauge, UL 2464 Tinned Copper Stranded Wire for LED Lighting in 3 different flavors. I got the 3 wire / conductor, the 5 wire, and now the 4 wire. The 5 wire is great for LEDs with a DC dimmer (AC - hot, neutral, ground & DC positive, negative for my dimmer switch). Boom! all done 1 cable. I got this 4 wire for my third LED high bay; I already had an available ground in the rafters next to the fixture. I ran the cable down and 2 AC wires (hot to toggle switch, neutral to neutral) & 2 wires for DC dimmer. Done. The 3 wire I used for my first High Bay - I had another two wire cable for the DC dimmer. I had to zip-tie those two together. This 3 wire cable is all you need for a non-dimmable LED or an LED fixture that uses AC dimmer technology. The wire is - nice supple / pliable PVC insulated 1/4\" outside diameter 16 gauge tinned copper. The Engineering Tool Box specs this wire at 6 amp carrying capacity up to 1000v @ 30 deg. C (86 F) ambient temperature. There is a .71 correction factor for temperatures between 41 - 45 deg. C (105 - 113 deg. F) So: 6(amps) x .71 = 4.26 4.26 amps is enough amperage for (3) 150w LED lamps. I'm using each cable for one fixture – I prefer to have the amperage up there for additions and the extra cost is minimal. I don't mind the extra cost for the marine rated tinned copper, but this company sells the same cable in the non-tinned flavor also. This is quality cable and makes for quick easy installations. I'll call that 5 Stars Thanks for Reading Tip: Don't get your crires wossed. Make a schematic – if you put AC power on the DC side your likely to fry your lamp.",
      "B0CPPWBGT8 ★★★★★ <b>High Quality Copper Wire - Great for High Current Applications..</b> When you buy electrical wire these days you have to be very careful to make sure that you’re getting a product that is actually copper and not some sort of copper cladded aluminum, which is difficult to use and can easily corrode. This wire is made from oxygen-free copper with a little silver and tin to protect it, which is especially important when the wire is carrying high current. It is easy to strip, readily accepts solder, crimp, compression, or butt connectors so you can make reliable connections and splices. The manufacturer also includes some heat-shrink tubing with this product but its small diameter (only a little larger than each insulated conductor itself) didn’t make it particularly useful. I did a high current test to measure the wire's resistance and found it to be 0.0025 ohms/ft., just what it should be for AWG 14 copper, so, this is definitely a high quality product.",

My methodology for Vine Program products is to give a more thorough -- often product-destructive -- review. If I like the product, I buy my own version of it, otherwise, it gets donated post-testing. I also may include my opinion on the product's value proposition to the market. REVIEW: -------------------------------- If I was to give a description that people might be able to reference, I'd say this feels like the power cord you'd find on a high-end power tool. It's thick, and doesn't have a strong odor (common in cheaper products). Each comes with some zipties and a few pieces of heat-shrink if you need it. Inspection of the individual wires does seem to indicate tinned copper (instead of tinned aluminum), but I'd need a better device to really tell. At slightly over ~$1/ft, it's not a bad deal if you just need it in a pinch for a project.

      "B0BYNNJS8B ★★★★★ <b>Good Quality, High Temp Wire</b> I work on a lot of electronics requiring 12-gauge wire and recently procured this wire for a couple of my projects. I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable.

The wire itself is indeed tinned copper, as I confirmed by scraping off the tin plating. It solders easily. The silicone insulation is more than adequate, but (perhaps due to how soft the wire is) it initially felt smaller than the 18 awg wire I ordered. However, my digital calipers confirm a 1.02 diameter, which is exactly what 18 awg should measure. That makes this wire the real deal and I would suggest that makes it an excellent value.

      "B0CNXJ9H6Q ★★★★★ <b>UL Listed low voltage cable</b> Reviewing the 50 ft. version. Ideal for low voltage applications, got this to use on speakers. I like that is UL listed/ These are tinned copper cables. Tinned prevents oxidization. Copper is a much better conductor.

      "B0CV7XP7JN ★★★★★ <b>Well made sheathed 3 conductor wire</b> This wire is as described in the product description. The tinned pure copper, and it really is, allows it to be used in many applications where it might see some humidity. The outer sheath is a nice thickness and molded tight to the three conductors , which will help prevent moisture intrusion. The insulation on the individual wires is on the thinner side, but again, the outer sheath toughens the whole bundle. The combination, along with the 27 tinned copper filaments in each wire, allows the wire to be fairly flexible. The included shrink sleeves are not dual wall (w/adhesive inner surface), so I won't be using them for my project, but they are not the main reason for getting this wire. The wire itself is nicely made and we are happy with it.",
      "B0BZ4R7JCZ ★★★★★ <b>Works great</b> The build quality of this electrical wire is outstanding. The wire features a solid and heavy-duty jacket that instills a sense of durability and reliability. It can withstand moderate impacts and rough handling without compromising its integrity. This rugged construction ensures that the wire can handle the demands of various electrical applications, making it suitable for both professional and DIY projects. Despite its solid construction, the wire remains surprisingly flexible and soft. It easily bends and maneuvers around corners, allowing for convenient routing and installation. The flexibility of the wire is especially useful when working in tight spaces or when dealing with complex wiring configurations. Its softness adds to the ease of handling and makes it effortless to work with during installations. I primarily utilized this wire as a tool power cable, connecting power tools and equipment to a power source. Throughout my projects, the wire performed flawlessly, delivering a consistent and reliable power supply. I encountered no issues with power transmission or connectivity. The tinned copper construction of the wire ensures excellent conductivity, minimizing any potential voltage drops or interference, resulting in efficient and uninterrupted operation of my tools. Additionally, the 16-gauge thickness of the wire is well-suited for most power applications. It offers ample current-carrying capacity for typical household tools and equipment, providing a safe and stable power supply. The wire's length of 100 feet provides sufficient reach, allowing for flexible placement of tools and work areas without the need for additional extension cords."

      "B0CH861BMS ★★★★★ <b>Good for cars and boats!</b> Wow! Great looking wire! Tinned copper wire is the way to go! It has the preferred characteristics of copper (low resistance and flexibility) with the corrosion resistance of tin. I have had to throw away pure copper wire from the 70s since it develops green oxidation and is a pain to clean but have yet to have to clean tinned copper before crimping or soldering. This wire has fewer strands that are larger and a heavy PVC outer coating, compared to the small strand silicon coated wire I use for RC helicopters. This makes it stiffer, easier to route, and tougher. I wouldn't hesitate to walk on this wire or pull it across metal edges that would cut silicon insulation. The larger strands are also better for crimping since smaller strands are more likely to break at the crimp. The only negative is the large outer diameter will limit the number of runs you can have in small spaces. Excellent wire! Recommended!",

These measure 0.102\" diameter and 0.042\" extra is a lot! Also, the spool interior that shows round is actually a small hex shape, ~0.0723\". Norma would be round, and either 0.750\" or 1.000\".

I must admit I had quite a lot of trouble stripping this wire at first. Traditional strippers that have a sharpened hole certainly wouldn't work due to the two conductors inside occupying more space in one direction than another. I tried cutting them carefully with a sharp knife and ended up cutting into the inner conductors despite my care. I think the trick is to either have some nice wire strippers that have the two heads that pull apart, which mostly work, or using a sharp knife in concert with bending the wire away from the cut so it pulls itself apart when split. A dismantling tool also works fairly well, though is harder to keep as pretty. The self-adjusting stripper is the easiest way and makes a decently clean separation, but is a bit fickle at the size and stretchiness of the outer layer.

      "B01B6R0OKQ ★★★★★ <b>Works well, looks nice</b> I installed some wireless, solar-powered security cameras on my house and was concerned about the longevity of the USB cable used to connect the solar panels to the cameras. The cords are permanently attached to the panels and cannot be replaced, so I didn't want them exposed constantly to sunlight and weather. So I ordered a 10' roll of the 3/8th\" tubing. I measure out how much cable length I'd need plus a little slack, then I wrapped the excess around one or both of the panel/camera mounts (depending on how much unused cable length there'd be) and wrapped self-bonding silicone tape around the cable to secure/waterproof/protect it. Then I cut an appropriate length of the split tubing and slipped it over the exposed cable between the two, then for some cameras where necessary I cut a smaller piece or two and added them to the small amount of slack I left after the wrapping. Where appropriate I wrapped a small amount of the silicone tape on the ends to keep it in place/further waterproof it. This gives a clean, finished, and professional look. I was impressed with the results so much I've ordered more additional cameras, as well as to help reorganize some computer cable routing.

I'm not sure the Amazon listing made it clear that this is UL approved, but it is. I measured the outside diameter at .225\", and peeling back the Rayon cover reveals a round white PVC jacket that is .210\" diameter. The PVC makes this cord rugged but also quite stiff compared to true antique (and less safe) cloth-covered cord that was usually just one or two cloth layers wound directly over the two individually-insulated conductors, but without the extra molded PVC jacket. Vintage cord used on lamps, radios, and other electrical devices usually was a little less bulky, more flexible and sometimes had an oval cross-section rather than round. This cord is well-suited for modern retro lighting and restoration applications where extreme flexibility and the ability to hang naturally under its own weight over short lengths is not a requirement. For greater flexibility, twisted cloth-covered cord is available from other sources. This has each PVC coated conductor individually wrapped in cloth and the pair of wires twisted together, yielding greater flexibility.

      "B0829NPHF3 ★★★★★ <b>As described, but double check your needs!</b> This is exactly the product that is described. It comes neatly spooled and held in place with three velcro wire wraps (a nice bonus, since I use those with all sorts of stuff). The wires can be pulled apart very easily, without any fear of exposing copper, for applications where you don’t need three or where the wires terminate in different places. My only caution is to double check the gauge requirement for your application. These are very thin wires. They’re supposed to be that thin, but if you’re not well acquainted with electrical hardware, you might accidentally order these for the wrong application. Know up front how much current you’ll be running (and how far) so that you don’t burn something down. In my application, I was mostly wiring LEDs, which draw a tiny current.",
      "B01MSHRGQS ★★★★★ <b>Fast shipping and variety.</b> Unfortunately, I had to send it back,as it was too thin. I ordered 20 gage to replace it and that was perfect for what I needed. Cheers!",
      "B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ <b>Thick jacket</b> If you think of a classic hand power tool cord with about a 1/4\" diameter power cable, this matches that - although it is only two wires, so not the right choice for that purpose. Just fine for outdoor speakers and other projects where a little extra protection on the wire is important. Takes a little skill to strip due to the jacket thickness; that's a good thing.",

It's really thin, really stiff, doesn't bend well, and overall just not what I was expecting. I've ran a lot of 12/2 (granted, solid) and this stuff is just so much thinner there's no way it's 12awg. And yes, I'm talking the wire itself without the insulation.",

      "B0BWY3JGGV ★★★☆☆ <b>Difficult to work with, especially for beginners.</b> The silicon sheathing makes for a very flexible wire. You do have to ensure that you are using the proper gauge stripper or you will break some of the center conductors. The center conductor consists of micro-fine strands, about the thickness of a human hair. This makes the wire even more flexible, but can be a pain in the ass when using especially for those that are new to soldering/prototyping. It can be easy to have a stray strand inadvertently short our components/connections. When tinning the wire, you have to be extra vigilant with any stray strands.",
      "B092XTB55G ★★★☆☆ <b>Conduit size Not standard.</b> Purchased this I had a tough time finding Correct fittings as this is an awkward off size conduit. A little frustrating going from store to store looking for something that doesn’t exist. I had to bootleg some 3/4” fittings. Other than that, it worked just as I needed it to.",
      "B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★☆ <b>True to gauge</b> The insulation is much thicker than it needs to be but the wire is the correct gauge and seems to be of good quality.

The white wire is much thinner. Running 12v 1A, it gets warm. It's like 110F the whole 5 feet I extended. So, if you need it to do the job of actual 20 gauge wire, buy another brand.

Verglichen mit anderen feinstdrähtigen (nicht feindrähtigen!) Kabel sind diese Silikonkabel bei gleichem Nennquerschnitt deutlich dicker, da der Mantel dicker ist. Trotz des dicken Mantels finde ich sie allerdings nicht wirklich schlitzfester. Das zu den Kabeln mitgelieferte Zubehör ist für mich nicht zu gebrauchen. Da ich mit diesen Kabel so unzufrieden bin, habe ich mir umgehend Ersatz besorgt und werde nur im Ausnahmefall auf diese Kabel zurückgreifen, wenn meine Markenware aufgebraucht ist.

      "B07VC719GS ★★☆☆☆ <b>This is supposed to be SPT-1 cable, but the insulation was so thick it broke an add-a-tap</b> I don't know why one buys zip cord like this unless it's to create fast, simple extension cords with the potential to add multiple outlets to them. Regardless of the type of add-a-tap or gilbert style plug you're attempting to install on these things, the diameter of the cord is really important. If it's too big, your taps and plugs simply won't fit. SPT-1 cord is supposed to have a much thinner insulation that SPT-2. I specifically chose this cord because it is listed as being SPT-1. Well...I nearly broke my thumbs trying to jam this into the Gilbert plug I bought. And then the first add-a-tap female plug I tried to install snapped in half because of the inordinate amount of pressure I had to apply to get it to close. I ended up having to file away some of the insulation so I could install my female plug. So if you're buying this cable with the idea of installing plugs on it, and you're not sure it will fit...well...it probably won't fit.",
      "B0CH861BMS ★★★★★ <b>Works Well</b> Great 18 Gauge 2-wire! It is slightly larger in diameter than my normal brand. So, I had to increase the hole I am using from 5mm to 5.5mm but that is no big deal! I wish they offered a bundle more than 50ft but maybe that will be available in the future! It provides good conductivity and the flexible shield is quality protection against the elements and strain. The price is on par with similar 18 gauge 2-wire. A solid option if it fits within the parameters of your project!",
      "B0C84BL61V ★★★★☆ <b>Incredibly flexible</b> Seems like decent wire, super flexible, insulation held up fine to being pulled through a raceway with a fish tape, does seem significantly larger OD than normal 12ga and perhaps it's the tinning but the conductor bundle seems a little fat too. Being tinned it didn't solder as nice as I hoped. Works fine though.",
      "B07YJNHCVH ★★★★☆ <b>Pretty sure this is 22 AWG</b> I compared this against some 20 AWG wire from an auto-parts store. I stripped and tightly twisted all the wires. Then I tinned it with solder to make it stay round when I measure it. The 20 AWG autoparts store wire measured 38 mils, this wire measured 25 mils. A wire gauge chart says 22 AWG is 25 mils.",
      "B01K4TM5A4 ★★★☆☆ <b>Slightly thicker outer diameter than standard 24awg</b> It is very good wire, however, if you are buying this for rgbcct lighting, go one size smaller, I could not fit this into connectors meant for 24awg.",

But this wire that I got (8 gauge it says) does not look anything like the wire that is used throughout the electrical work of the stove/oven. The stove/oven wire appears to be about one third the diameter of the ordered wire in question. It has a hard, heat resistant , thin coating whereas the wire that was sent to me is covered in soft silicone, the kind you might use to make a mouthpiece out of. Apparently the wire I ordered is used to enhance the volume of the crappy music people play these days.",
      "B01MSHRGQS ★★★★☆ <b>Not quite what I was expecting</b> Little small the images make it seem a lot larger",
      "B0BGMVRR6G ★★★★★ <b>Larger than expected</b> The product is well made and can be buried without a conduit due to its superior cover. It is as watertight as possible. The only thing I didn't like was all the extra material which made the 6/3 wires with insulation, and is covered by a durable rubber jacket was larger in diameter than my 4/4 of the same SOOW.",

      "B000BPG1ZC ★★★★☆ <b>It's wire. Not like the old wire.</b> I am not a pro, just a do-it-yourselfer. I didn't have to pull this through conduit so I can't vouch for that. I will say the shielding is flimsy, it tears fairly easily. It does not hug the wires, the wires rattle around inside the shielding. The shielding is very easily cut and removed. I assume all this makes it easier to work with for pros, but for a layman you have to be cautious not to rip through to the conductors. I was attaching this to 1979 wiring, and it's pretty shocking how much smaller the new wire is. Both old and new were 12-2 gauge, but the original copper is about twice as big around. How does that work?",
      "B07M94L2F8 ★★★★☆ <b>Big projects only</b> It's a pretty thick wire for grounding. That being said it's not very flexible and you should keep it away from smaller projects.",

It arrived overnight but it's definitely not 22 gauge. Not even close. I didn't need 22 gauge anyway so it worked for my need, but it won't work if I need 22 gauge in the future. It's pretty shady trying to pawn this off as something it's not. My 22 gauge ferrules didn't really grip on to this either, but again I made it work. If this was advertised as 24 gauge it would have gotten 5 stars.",

      "B09DSQ9YLC ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Not worth the price paid</b> I am hard pressed to believe there is any copper in this wire at all. I was able to strip the insulation with a finger nail and then pull off the insulation with my finger tips unfortunately the strands of wire are so thin that you loose 1/3 - 2/3 trying to strip it. The wire is basically worthless for any use. Before i tossed it in the trash I actually ran it off the spool and there was not 50'. It made it about 2' beyond the 40' shop I was working in. Don't waster your money on this wire from this company.",

I scraped the tin coating off and got the red of copper. Cut through it and it looked like copper in the core. Wire core is about 2mm thick which lines up with the thickness of 14 awg wire, 4 mm total with the sleeve. It's very flexible and easy to manipulate and looks like quality wire.

Including the connectitions routing through wall, ceiling; approximately 25' of cable was used to make the new connection from the panel. 6 awg wire is rated 75 amp at 90 deg. c. Tesla, maximum current draw is 48 amps. Hooked up to a 60 amp breaker, and set the charging to 60 amp via charger app, which Tesla limits to charge current to maximum of 48 amps. Fastest home charge set up for model 3 and Y. Metal clad is a good option for me as i don't have to set up conduit to route wires. 2 hot wires-6awg wires, 1 ground(green),appears to be a 8 awg(wire stripper works at 8 awg setting), while 2 hot wires, were stripped using 6 awg wire stripper setting. This brand(wirenco) is cheaper than other md 6/2 cables. Others selling for near $220 for 50', this brand(Wirenco) sells for $164.95(50') with same spec as more expensive ones, MC connectors were a bit hard to find (.75 inches in diameer) for this cab le, as 3/4 mc connectors most often do not specify cable size or diameter.

      "B0BXKLS2T4 ★★★★★ <b>Actual real copper wire, unlike many other brands, and exactly as advertised. Very pleased.</b> I've previously ordered silicone sheathed wire from suppliers like BNTechGo and others which advertise as \"stranded copper wire\", but are no such thing. They might have a single strand of copper in each wire, and the rest be aluminum, but they are certainly not predominantly copper. The wire strands look and feel nothing like solid copper. Enter Shonsin brand, who I only recently discovered. I ordered this 10AWG cable hoping that for once it might be what was actually advertised, and for once I was pleasantly surprised ! Real solid copper strands, great flexibility, wire gauge to specification, nice flexible silicone sheath that doesn't shrink back when soldering or using heatshrink with a heatgun. Exactly what it should be. The outer diameter of the 10AWG wire was a little larger than ideal for part of my project (my fault for not checking, since it's EXACTLY as they list in their description and sizing/gauge table), and since for that specific use I can get away with 12AWG electrically, I just placed an order for some of their 12AWG cable too. I'm still using the 10AWG cable where the size permits, and will just use the 12AWG for the wires that needs to pass through a small grommet. Hopefully the 12AWG wire is just as good as the 10AWG that I'm already using. Buying shorter lengths is always a little pricey, but this brand seems better quality by far than any of the other brands I've tried (and no more expensive for similar lengths)",
      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Super flexible with extreme temperature rating</b> This wire uses solid tin-plated copper conductors and has a very high strand count for extreme flexibility. Although I don't see any voltage rating printed on the wire, the silicone insulation is quite thick compared to some other 16-gauge silicone wires that I have used. The outside diameter measures 3mm. The only markings on the wire are the gauge and the 200C (that's 392F) temperature rating. The ad does indicate a 600 volt insulation rating (but this is not marked) and gives a strand count of 252 @ 0.08mm. Of course with the silicone there is no insulation creep from soldering heat. This is good for RC work, and if you need a quantity the per/foot cost is much lower than hobby shop prices where you pay much more for a carded and packaged 3 or 6 foot length. Recommended.",

      "B0CV7XSN9H ★★★★★ <b>Far superior to what I found in the walls...</b> I've bought and used a lot of wire over the years-- enough to have found the experience peculiarly reminiscent of my old online dating days. What I see and read online isn't always what I get. (In this case, however, things are even better in person than in the pics.) ; ) PROS: - Thicker-than-usual copper strands - Tinned (coated with an oxidation-resistant metal to protect the copper) - Banana plugs grip tight on the copper strands - not going to rip out - Stiff-yet-flexible (unlike solid core) CONS: - Does not include B&W speakers. But to be fair, that would be a really bad business decision. * NOTE: - This is unshielded speaker wire. (Just mentioning it for people like me who search for the word \"shielded\" on wire product pages when I need to verify if it's shielded or not.) * that was supposed to be humor.",
      "B0BDP5JM4D ★★★★★ <b>I like them better than Lever Nuts!</b> Blasphemy, I know. I was tired of Wago not offering a 4 conductor Lever Nut, so I decided to give these a try instead. I’m sold. They are TINY! Slimmer than Lever Nuts and they provide some serious clamping force to a conductor. I’ve had Lever Nuts open on me in a crowded box, so I’m always paranoid and have to double check each Lever Nut before I close it all up. No more worrying about that. Stick the conductor in and I don’t have to worry about it coming out. I pulled as hard as I could and I could not remove it. The conductor can only be removed by twisting and pulling at the same time. Love them so much I bought multiple sizes.",

      "B088NWL5RL ★★★★★ <b>Cavo eccellente!</b> Ho recentemente acquistato il cavo di prolunga Carlits 22AWG e devo dire che sono rimasto estremamente soddisfatto della sua qualità e delle prestazioni. La lunghezza generosa di 30 metri (100 piedi) è stata esattamente ciò di cui avevo bisogno per i miei progetti di cablaggio. Il cavo è realizzato con rame stagnato di alta qualità, che garantisce una trasmissione affidabile del segnale e una maggiore resistenza alla corrosione nel tempo. La flessibilità del cavo è ottima, il che rende facile maneggiarlo e installarlo anche in spazi ristretti o complessi. Inoltre, la sezione trasversale di 0.3mm² è adatta per una varietà di applicazioni, dalla cablatura di dispositivi elettronici al collegamento di sensori e attuatori. Ho trovato che la saldatura su questo cavo sia stata estremamente semplice e pulita, grazie alla superficie stagnata che favorisce un'ottima adesione del saldatore. In conclusione, consiglio vivamente il cavo di prolunga Carlits 22AWG a chiunque abbia bisogno di un cavo di alta qualità per i propri progetti elettronici. La sua affidabilità, flessibilità e facilità di saldatura lo rendono una scelta eccellente per hobbisti e professionisti alike.",
      "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★☆ <b>Seems good, but lacks expected compliance markings</b> This is massive wire - 16AWG / 6 conductor … it's about 1/2\" in diameter, and surprisingly heavy. I'm a little concerned - the jacket is a PVC tube, not molded to the internal conductors in any way, and bears no markings - cable like this normally carries various markings indicating its flammability/flame-resistant characteristics, and so forth - but this cable bears no such markings. That makes me wonder if it meets all of the relevant standards and such. I certainly wouldn't use it in any application where that sort of thing were important.",

The heater was fairly new, but the wiring was probably 40 years old. I updated to a smart thermostat and didn't want to have to use the adapter included with it. Luckily my thermostat wire was a short 10ft run almost straight up from the basement. Mine was a super easy tape and wrap job to pull the wire straight up. This wire is actually a bit thicker than what was there, and it's got some sturdiness to it. the Sheathing is quality and the colors are right for the job. I had the manual from the Heater to make sure the connections are correct. And always power off your heater BEFORE doing this. There is a fuse in the heater you can blow which makes it a 2 day job.",
      "B0B3H27JG2 ★★★★★ <b>Convenient dispenser</b> I got this (along with a box of the 22 awg) to wire a custom-built Delta printer. The box is nicely designed, so you can feed the end of each colour through a hole in the box and pull out the length you need, without having to open the box. It comes with a collection of coloured cable-ties and heat shrink, plus a rather feeble wire stripper, which I thought was a nice touch. The wire is a good quality, crimps and solders easily and is easy to work with. This box was primarily for wiring the mains, power supply to the main board and power the mosfets, hot end and print bed.",

Copper wire is copper wire.... why pay more? Especially good value if you are powering halogen or incandescent landscape lights, or a LOT of LEDs. Wire is a bit beefy for a few LEDs, but it will work and you'll have an upgrade path. You should be good for 180 watts worth of lights on a 12 volt system (360 on a 24 volt system) with this gauge stranded copper wire. At 3-5 watts each per LED garden light, that's a lot of LEDs! This insulation is a little tough. This makes installation difficult and may not be compatible with substandard or old, used, oxidized landscape wire taps. That being said, the wire being tough should ensure it will last a long time buried, even if installation is a little difficult. For what it's worth, the cheapest 14-2 option at my local hardware store had tougher insulation.",

So as you might imagine, I have used hundreds upon hundreds of feet of low voltage wire, and a good deal of that number is of the 12/2 variety. So what sets this particular wire apart from the others? Well, nothing really, and I don't mean that in a bad way. It's really quite simple - this wire is every bit as good as any of the other 12/2 wire I have on my system, and that is a good thing, because all of the wire I have used is a good quality, and this is wire is no exception. Since this wire is essentially the same as all the others I have used, what it really comes down to is value for the money.

It might matter a little bit if you are trying to pull it through 10 studs at once or so, but I don't think it would be a big difference. Overall, this wire seems to be right in line with the Romex. At the moment, this 100 ft roll is cheaper by about $20 than the 100 ft of Romex. I will say if you can bump up to the 250 ft roll, that is usually the best deal, but sometimes that is just overkill for your project and a smaller roll works out better.

The PVC insulation is tough and will stand up to abrasion. This cable should not be used for line voltage applications as the insulation is not rated for that application. I use 14/2 cable in my landscape lighting for the final connections to groups of LED fixtures. I use 12/2 for distribution over long distances to get to the clusters of fixtures. 14/2 works great in that application and helps to save a little money compared to running 12/2 everywhere. If your cable runs are all short and you have a modest number of LED fixtures then 14/2 may be good enough for the entire system. Note that 14/2 cable has a lower current rating than 12/2 cable, which is counterintuitive given the numbers are getting smaller as ampacity increases. So if you've got really long cable runs you'll probably want to use the 12/2 instead.",

      "B0BY25MWGN ★★★★★ <b>Rewired my Shipping Container</b> I recently converted my shipping container to solar and with it came heat. My container had been built to be powered and since I wanted to be off the grid solar is my option. I have a windmill that I will be adding later but for now solar it is. Solar power is hot. Connecting wires to a battery and inverter get hot. Regular wires will not work in this setup and I need thicker wires. I have found that 12 to 4 gauge wires work best for me. Thicker wires connecting the big things and 12 gauge leading to my appliances. This wire is easy to use and is extremely flexible. It is easy to connect and cut. The plastic can take high temps as well as the wire. This wire will help save fuses as other wires I used caused my fuses to pop way to often. The containers are in the high desert so the interior gets hot as it is so good wires are even more important. These are solid wires. If you are looking for a way to convert your cheaper wires into something better check these wires out. They are solid, they can take high heat and they work well.",

This cable is quite thick for the pin to make a good connection with the copper wire and some of my lights have taken several tries to get them to connect. My previous experiences with this type of connector and another brand of cable were quite positive.....now, using the identical lights again, they do not work as well with this cable. It is a 250' run of cable and it was very difficult to lay out in some very odd, tight places but quite a sturdy cable.

I will say the shielding is flimsy, it tears fairly easily. It does not hug the wires, the wires rattle around inside the shielding. The shielding is very easily cut and removed. I assume all this makes it easier to work with for pros, but for a layman you have to be cautious not to rip through to the conductors. I was attaching this to 1979 wiring, and it's pretty shocking how much smaller the new wire is. Both old and new were 12-2 gauge, but the original copper is about twice as big around.

I also used a few wago connectors to do this, but this 18/6 wire worked out well, even if I didn't need all 25 feet of it.",
      "B0CGQ29J9Q ★★★★★ <b>This is a nice 12 core wire</b> I like this cable a lot. The colors of the cores are very easy to differentiate from one another, the outer encasing insulation is highly flexible, the wire straps with ease using standard wire strippers, it accepts solder without any problem, the insulation withstands the soldering gun temp without degrading. 5 star rating in my book",
      "B0C5BLQ327 ★★★★★ <b>Nice length for small project.</b> 25ft is not much, so if you are doing a small job it is great. 12guage is perfect as well for 20 amp breakers, and more than needed for 15 amps. This is a standard Romex style wire with vinyl outer sleeve and insulated individual wires, (white, black, and uninsulated ground.) I do wonder why we do not insulate our ground wires, but that is the standard here and I haven't seen any issues to date with that. Honestly, ground and neutral seem to be ok on the same ground blocks unless you feed into a sub panel where neutral and ground have to be on separate bus bars. Moving on from the lesson, I can say this is a good 12/2 romex that I can recommend that is also decently priced. Locally 15ft of 12/2 romex costs 28 dollars and 40 dollars for 25ft just to give some context on how good this is as a deal."

      "B0CGQ29J9Q ★★★★★ <b>Super flexible</b> Was looking for a multi 24 gauge conductor cable to make my own low voltage umbilical for my 3d printer vs using ribbon or individual wires heat shrunk together. Looked at and tried many types and they were never flexible enough to give me the comfort that they wouldn't bind or have the wires break inside. This stuff flexes so well that it can be routed easily and definitely will clean up the wiring, it even maintains it's path and doesn't flop to the side so it won't need anything more than a strand of filament to keep it inline and away from motion parts. I can run all 3 fans, thermistor, and 3 wire LEDs in this one cable with all their individual wires hooked up. If you run even a cheap breakout toolhead and deck pcb with a common ground you can add in the 5 BL probe wires into it and only have your servo cable and heater wires separate in the sleeving, which they should be anyways due to size/current differences. All this in a 6mm or so package. I did tidy wiring before but could never get all the wires to less than 11-12mm and they were always lumpy and didn't flex well binding up my toolhead on certain movements. This will help me get it down to less than 10mm diameter in total. If i upgrade to a board system i'll definitely come back to see if there's a cable with the proper number i need to keep all the low voltage in one. Only thing that would make this perfect is to have multi gauges in it but that's custom cabling and i don't need 50,000 ft of it.",
      "B0CSD3KPX3 ★★★★★ <b>Well manufactured wire</b> One of the striking features of the 16 gauge wire I purchased was its quality. The wire was very supple and allowed me to bury the cable easily and in tight places. Also the two wires were easily identifiable by the unique texture of each wire. I have purchased other wires in the past but none were as good as the Sunvie brand. I will not hesitate to purchase again. Jim",
      "B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ <b>2 Conductor 16 Guage wire UL rated for up to 300V for AC line level or low voltage use</b> The Amazon Product Page headline undersells the capabilities of (at least) the wire I received. It's also rated for 105C temperature. The UL marking and description is pressed or molded into the outer wire sheath so you can tell the details for what the actual wire manufacturer claims to be it's characteristics. I originally ordered this wire to install an 8' long LED strip light in my garage. The light itself came with a three-wire pigtail, so I've decided to use a different wire. I will likely turn this roll of wire into an extension cord since it seems like a good quality wire that is fairly flexible.",
      "B0CF55452S ★★★★★ <b>Well made, quality wire</b> I received this from Amazon, as a Vine Member. 16 gauge is a little on the thin side, but I suppose most landscaping lights are LED now. I was pleased to see the insulation is nice and thick. I also appreciated the clear and easy to read markings printed in white on the sheathing.",
      "B0CLHD8WR3 ★★★★★ <b>Seems like good hook up wire at a good price</b> I read in some reviews that others were complaining about poor copper cladding and strands breaking off when stripping and long term oxidation. I can't really say about the long term, but I did strip some of this wire when I got it to check for the other issues. I'm not sure if maybe they just got some bad wire in their shipment, but this looks like pretty decent hookup wire. I don't intend on using this for high current situations, and I don't crimp the bare wire in my terminal lugs (I usually crimp on pins and at times add a touch of solder if needed). As you can see in the picture, the copper cladding looks just fine and I had no strands break off when I stripped the PVC jacket off. I also wiggled the strands around (that's why it looks so messy) and I had none break off from bending. The true test is over time to see if I have any issues with oxidation or anything else, but so far this wire seems to be just fine. I did not check the diameter of the wire to verify it it was 16 Gauge or not. I'll just say that for my application, it's just fine. I would not spec wire or any other component to be near the limit of my needs anyway. So if my wire is slightly smaller than the 16 gauge, it should still be well within the specs I need.",

It is very pliable and can be used in almost any situation from mechanical connections to solder connections. The variety of colors lens itself to use for HVAC, electronics and other more complicated electronic devices. This is high quality wire and I would recommend it highly.",
      "B0C9H1G52F ★★★★★ <b>good electrical landscape wires</b> In my backyard, I have trees, fruit trees and other trees. Looking out at the green and the shade that those trees provide is a great feeling. But why enjoy them only during the day. A good set of landscaping lights make all the difference in my yard at night. The easiest option to do this are the ever popular solar lights that you just pop into the ground and the just work. Unfortunately, those can get expensive and the batteries in them are usually still NiCad, which will lose their charge after just a few months. Wiring your own lights isn't difficult. This Elite 16/2 Landscape Lighting Wire provides low voltage copper wires in an outdoor-rated, weather resistant coating that can be buried without additional conduits. The pricing for this product is reasonable there really isn't much to complain about. The wire itself is somewhat stiff but it really is like working with the drip irrigation pipes. Just lay out the wire, tack it in place and connect the lights. This product works as you would expect and very durable, these wires have been in ground for over 6 months and they're still working great, no issues at all..",
      "B0CLBHT8YX ★★★★☆ <b>Good for small projects</b> It seems I'm always scrounging for sections of wire on different RV projects and usually find something leftover from an older finished project that works but maybe is not the best (such as by adding pigtails). This has 5 fifty foot rolls of 5 colors that should end the scrounging. This is a copper clad aluminum core (CCA) wire. The copper reduces corrosion caused by moisture and oxidation and adds surface conductivity. I got it to use for some small 12V wiring projects in the RV (additional 12 volt computer fan for gas refrigerator cooling) and to have on hand when I just need some short lengths of wire. For reference, Cu Clad Al (CCA) wire can be used for main wire projects but at a much larger gauge as aluminum has a higher resistance than copper. 12 AWG is recommended for a 15 Amp 110V circuit and 10 AWG for a 20 Amp. This is a 36 strand 16 AWG braided wire so it's not made for heavy loads or 110 volt wiring. Specs are for up to 80 volts. The wire is flexible and there's enough copper coating for it to solder easily to itself. If there's trouble having the wire stick, a copper infused solder works. I used some lead free Rosin Core 2.0 Sn99 Ag0.3 Cu0.7 electronics solder and everything was sucked into the wire and stuck together. I couldn't find the percent by weight of copper anywhere on the rolls, package, or website. The range for CCA is anywhere from 10% to 24% by weight, with the more the better (but also more expensive). 15 small zip ties and 10 heat shrink tubes are included in the box. I'm never going to use this on a main AC wiring project but for small electrical projects, it's a good economical choice and should last a long time. If you don't want 5 colors and a dispenser box, 4-color roll packages of 100'/roll 16AWG of this brand are the same price if you shop around. 4 stars - copper specs not given.",
      "B0CV7XSN9H ★★★★★ <b>Color-Coded 6-Strand Cable</b> I got this in the 16-gauge size, suitable for a lot of the rewiring I’m doing on my powerboat. I appreciate that this is 6 color-coded strands, so I can match my hookup at one end with what I need to connect to at at the other. Easy-peasy. This comes in a rugged PVC sleeve that is flexible and easy to run where I need it to go. This is a 25-ft roll for your $35, or a buck-forty per foot.",
      "B0CNXJ9H6Q ★★★★★ <b>Great for my speaker re-wiring project</b> I got this for a project where I needed to re-wire a speaker in my car and this worked great for what I needed. Since it is a paired set of 16-gauge wire, it made it easy to run the sort distance I needed. It worked great and my speaker is working again with no issues. You don’t get much, but it was more than I needed and the price was fair. Good choice for small projects and it worked for my audio needs.",
      "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★☆ <b>Good quality 6-conductor copper stranded wire.</b> BOTTOM LINE: 1. I recommend this NAOEVO 16 gauge 6 conductor electrical wire 50 foot coil. 2. The current price of ~$66 is reasonable. LIKES: - Great quality for low voltage uses. - Good temperature profile. - Tinned copper. - Working well for connecting 2 buildings for a low voltage application. DISLIKES: - The individual copper wires sort of float inside of the outer protective plastic sheath. This leaves a somewhat sloppy appearance."

Pain in the royal tookus to smash into the deepest metal box with a stand-off plaster faceplate but it became a lot easier when I pulled the wire through a bit and worked on wiring the plug with slack and cutting each wire to a specific length from the 3/4 connector so the wire didn’t have to bend when mounting the plug. Then I just fed back the extra wire until the plug was mounted. Gotta plan accordingly so you retain the wire sheathing at the connector if you do it that way. Finally had a use for my hex sockets when torquing these. Highly recommend mounting it in the box and pulling the plug back out and retorquing because I did that by chance and found I could get a little bit more tight in the connections. 6/3 wire is no joke. Oh, get a little extra so you have enough bare ground to connect to the metal box, if using one.",

It will hold up to all the abuse I'll be putting it through using my boat at least once a week year round. The spool the wire comes on is actually pretty nice too. It's not as thin and easy to break as some of the spools you get at the big home improvement stores. I wish it had a way to keep the wire from unspooling but that's easily remedied by tucking the wire in to itself. Overall great wire at a good price!",
      "B0C6R2NJD2 ★★★★★ <b>Standard quality wire for small jobs.</b> I got this roll to add a wall switch to an existing overhead light. They are close together. I will use 6 inches in the box on both ends and need to staple the wire to studs in a 90 degree bend best practice. In most cases, I would use 50 feet because I don't want to put in a junction box if the wire is too short. I try to measure the job first, making sure I have enough wire without using a junction box. Be generous with your estimate. NM-B 14/2 wire is for standard indoor 15A service. Not for 20A service. This is standard wire for small jobs but I would plan on buying longer lengths.",
      "B08DTTSMG7 ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Shrinkflation Does Exist</b> Purchased this advertised 100 ft. length of 16/2 landscape lighting cable in January for an early spring lighting project. I needed 97 ft. of cable for my project. To my surprise when I was half way through the install, it appeared the remaining length of cable was going to be to short. Sure enough, I pulled a tape from my connection point at the lighting control box to the end of the cable (splice point shown) as shown in the first pic and it came out to 85 ft. exactly, 15 ft. short. I heard that shrinkflation is becoming normal in products these days but this is ridiculous. I had to borrow some old cable from a neighbor and splice it onto my brand new cable to finish my project! So much for a splice-less installation. They got me again! Highly recommend you try another manufacturer!",
      "B073593MHW ★★☆☆☆ <b>Not 100 feet</b> Ran the wire yesterday and came up 10 feet short. I measured what I needed 4 times before I ordered it. I was in the construction industry for over 30 years so I know how to use a tape measure. I bought 100 feet of 12/2 and 100 feet of 12/3 and both were short. Triple checked my measurements and I am right. Both rolls were short. Screwed me pretty good because we were burying and tamping down the soil as we went. Funny thing is as soon as I took the plastic off I said wow that doesn’t seem like 100’. The rolls felt too small. After using these products for years I guess you can pick up the difference.",
      "B000VHDRDO ★★★★☆ <b>Will this hold up underground?</b> I've used a lot of UF cable before and the outer sheath always appeared durable and added some substance to the cable size as a whole. When I got this and unrolled it, I was struck by how flimsy it seemed. I had to re-check the packaging and cable markings to be sure it was 12/2 UF and not grey NM or 14/2. Once I slit the sheath, the conductors are clearly 12 AWG however. The sheath on what I got is so thin, I'll have to put it in conduit or flex where it comes out of the ground to the device boxes to protect it from wear and damage. I don't remember having to do that before. I'm not sure what Southwire is doing here, but I'm not impressed.",

      "B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★★ <b>Typical for 15-amp residential circuits</b> Last time I got a product from this brand, it was actually Southwire, so I assumed they shared names depending on where its sold. This came labeled \"Arizona\", but it's clearly what you buy at the regular home improvement store, and it's clearly UL listed. Not sure what the deal is with the branding, but I'm 100% comfortable with this. To ensure you don't end up with a counterfeit, just be sure the cable itself says (UL) every 2 feet or so. Normally, larger rolls are cheaper per foot, and you'll use longer than what you measured almost inevitably.",

Says it's USA made and UL listed which is stuff I personally like to see and prefer over Chinese products. It's stripped nicely at the 14 size for both the jacket and the wires with my electrical pliers and felt the exact same as other 14/2 I have used in terms of how it bent and how it felt rolling the extra left over. So this is an easy product to recommend and will be my choice when I need wire as it's the same quality for less money and doesn't require a trip to the store.",

It is 18 gauge, so don't run high wattage through it, but it is fine for decorative electronics."

If you are at job site with heavy foot traffic it is nice to have the peace of mind that the cable is up to the challenge.",
      "B0BVLVY881 ★★★★★ <b>Shockingly heavy wire</b> I purchased this to run some longer lengths of LED strip lights, and it did not disappoint. It's best to use flux and tin the ends prior to soldering, if that's your purpose, but I found that it's sufficient for my purposes and over the top compared to using 22AWG wire.",
      "B07C5V9RVB ★★★★★ <b>Reasonably priced low volt landscape wire</b> Used for installation of LED 12 V landscape lights in yard. Properly striped for +/- orientation (important for some LED installations), stranded copper, wire was easy to cut and split into separate wires for connections. Stripped well. All LED installation means I had very little amperage to carry so could use much thinner wire (higher gauge) and therefore decrease overall cost. Used this to run any split leg off of main run (12 gauge) and had no issues with any lights. Total main run was <100 ft. Each leg run was <40 ft. Coupling was done with wire nuts filled with silicone to waterproof and limit corrosion.",

      "B01LH1G18U ★★★★★ <b>Great for Models</b> Great for wiring small models, and large ones too. It is a thin gage so use the correct tools to strip back the insulation. Gave it a four on heat resistance, but wires this small are never good when you put a soldering iron to them. This wire otherwise will definitely handle 3-24V DC",

      "B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★★ <b>Not to Thin or to Thick</b> I was looking for some insulated wire to install my new recess lights for all the bedrooms. I was shopping on-line and I came across this 100 ft. copper wire. I love that this particular wire is not to thin and its not to thick to use on wiring lighting. I have 3 bedrooms and this package should be enough for me to wire 4 recess lights in each room. The wire is easy to work with compared to the thicker wire. This item was a great buy and will come in handy for future projects I have.",

      "B08MQVH6PT ★★★★★ <b>Good so far.</b> I have not installed this yet but this roll looks like the real deal. Heavy copper in the size stated. Actually a little thicker then I expected having worked with shorter runs of bare copper ground wire before. I am trying to maintain some NEC rules on ground bonding and I suspect some others reading this know all the many lengthy interpretations on that subject. I am trying to do things right and I have started with this product for this project.",
      "B09KV23X1T ★★★★★ <b>Did the job at a fraction of the cost.</b> I ordered this wire to run some low voltage yard lights around our front and back yard. I went to the local store and found that wire was crazy expensive. This wire was not only a thicker gauge but it was also longer than what was being sold in stores. So far I have had no issues and the rubber outer casing seems to stand up well to the elements. 5/5 stars, would highly recommend this product!",
      "B0CG1GSW3P ★★★★★ <b>Nice heavy wire with thick insulation.</b> This is good heavy wire, multi strand that is very flexible. The insulation is fairly thick but is very flexible as well. If you are routing the wire through a tight area with tight bends it should work well.",
      "B0CPPWBGT8 ★★★★★ <b>Good Universal Cable, Great For Wiring LED Lights</b> I am very happy with this wire. I used it to install LED lights in my kitchen and I prefer it over the thinner cable that came with the lights. It's probably overkill but I like that it's sturdy and won't kink as easy. So five stars from me. I hope this helps to make a decision."

I inspected the wiring at both the sensors and on the control board at the head unit and looked good. Was thinking that maybe the control board was bad. then I came upon a thread where the homeowner said he had a similar problem and replaced the wiring and it worked. That didn't seem the likely issue to me but it was cheaper than buying a new control board. So I rewired with this wiring and lo and behold, it works as it should. I only gave it 4 stars because it could stand to be about 2' longer. There is not much margin for error when you run it from the head unit to each sensor. I found I had about 3-4\" to spare without everything being run pretty tight over the rail, along the garage door header beam and then down the side king studs. Good luck.",

      "B09CCK5BD7 ★★★★☆ <b>Probably not UV resistant</b> Summary: When it comes to electric power, generally the bigger the cable (lower AWG) the more efficient. Observations: Previously Vine reviewed the 10ft 12AWG cable by iGreely, and the jacket was not UV resistant as stated; after 3-months in the sun daily, the jacket faded from red to nearly white, therefore, the UV resistance claim is suspect. You can see pictures of the faded cable in my review listed below. Recommendation: Along with the largest wire, you should also go with the shortest for your applications. iGreely offers 1.0, 1.8 and 3.0 meters, so order the one that meets your need. Based on previous iGreely wire experience, I would not use this wire outdoors. Pros: Heavy duty, 1x6mm^2 (10AWG) marked. Cons: UV resistance not proven (based on similar iGreely experience). Conclusion: At $40 for 30ft ($1.33/foot/pair), rating this 4-stars for now.

      "B0CSD3GJ53 ★★★★★ <b>Great for Direct Burial</b> I have installed about 100 feet of the 12/2 low voltage wire and am impressed with the quality of the product. About 30 feet is buried directly underground from the corner of my house over to the rock wall. The wire is tucked behind and around the large rocks 10 feet up the wall. The casing of the wire is very durable. I must say that I was not at all delicate or gentle while handling it. I made a line in the soil with a garden edging tool down about two inches and used the same tool to shove the wire in the ground. I had no issue with the casing cracking or the wire breaking. I chose the 12 gauge wire to reduce the voltage drop over the long run. I am currently only using 100 watts of lighting but plan to increase it in the future. I liked this product very much. There are a lot of manufacturers of this type of product out there and I have had a few that did not hold up to the Northeast weather. I think that this cable will last quite a long time.

      "B01B6R0OKQ ★★★★★ <b>Works well, looks nice</b> I installed some wireless, solar-powered security cameras on my house and was concerned about the longevity of the USB cable used to connect the solar panels to the cameras. The cords are permanently attached to the panels and cannot be replaced, so I didn't want them exposed constantly to sunlight and weather. So I ordered a 10' roll of the 3/8th\" tubing. I measure out how much cable length I'd need plus a little slack, then I wrapped the excess around one or both of the panel/camera mounts (depending on how much unused cable length there'd be) and wrapped self-bonding silicone tape around the cable to secure/waterproof/protect it. Then I cut an appropriate length of the split tubing and slipped it over the exposed cable between the two, then for some cameras where necessary I cut a smaller piece or two and added them to the small amount of slack I left after the wrapping. Where appropriate I wrapped a small amount of the silicone tape on the ends to keep it in place/further waterproof it. This gives a clean, finished, and professional look. I was impressed with the results so much I've ordered more additional cameras, as well as to help reorganize some computer cable routing. I'm up to 5 rolls so far, I just wish the larger sizes were also available in 10' lengths for a similar price.",

      "B0B6PGY65W ★★★★☆ <b>Its a good decision to buy!</b> I recently purchased the TYUMEN 40FT 18 Gauge 2pin 2 Color Red Black Cable Hookup Electrical Wire for my LED strip lighting project and I have to say, I am quite pleased with the product. The wire is of good quality and it has met my expectations. One of the main reasons I purchased this wire was for its length. The 40FT wire is long enough to cover the entire length of my LED strip lighting project and it provides enough slack to make the installation process much easier. The 2pin 2 color red black cable also makes it easy to identify the positive and negative wires, which is very helpful during the installation process. The red and black color coding also helps me to keep track of the connections and ensure that everything is connected properly. The 18-gauge wire is also thick enough to handle the current of my LED strip lights, which I found to be a big plus. It ensures that the wire can handle the power and prevents any potential overheating or damage to the wire. The only downside to this product is that the wire is a bit stiff, it's not very flexible which can make it a bit difficult to bend and shape to the desired position. But it's a small price to pay for the quality and durability of the wire. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the TYUMEN 40FT 18 Gauge 2pin 2 Color Red Black Cable Hookup Electrical Wire for LED Strips. It's a great investment for anyone who wants a high-quality and durable wire for their LED strip lighting projects. It's not perfect, but it's a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable electrical wire.",

This has 30 feet of parallel joined jacket R&B conductors using tinned copper stranded wire rated for up to 300 Volts. I'm using it for no more than 48 Volts DC so this will do just fine. Stranded wire is more flexible and less prone to fatigue breakage. I do wish this had the more modern silicone insulating jacket which has better flexibility and resistance to oil. It is more costly. I stripped an end to show the tinned strands and scraped off some tinning to show the true copper conductor core, not Copper Clad Aluminum (CCA) which is cheaper. The tinning will enhance my ease of soldering this wire.

I picked this up to finally put my aftermarket subwoofer and amp in my car after putting it off for a long time. Often enough, a lot of audio systems are wired up using 16 or 18 gauge wire, but I wanted something thicker to transmit more efficiently and not possibly run hot, so this 14 gauge spool was perfect. At 20 cents per foot, it is a good value. Now I can't say that my ear can distinguish any difference in audio, but I like knowing the thicker wire is there and will handle whatever I throw at it.",
      "B07T5JWRB6 ★★★★★ <b>Great Quality wire</b> Purchased this to rewire the three wire currently in our walls. The new wire is thick and and seems high quality. Definitely better than what was offered at my local hardware store. Got the 50 ft even tho I only needed 25 (just in case). Good move on my part as there was an unseen obstacle in the wall and I had to go around, which burned up an additional 15 of wire. Now the Nest Learning V3 has it's own C wire and there is plenty of wire options left over for what ever we decide to add to the furnace in the future (which is why I decided to go with the 18/8 instead of the 18/5. Rewiring was fun enough the first time. No need to repeat it) As a side note, interesting that I had the option (in addition to Overall Rating, Stretch, and Thickness) to rate the \"Warmth\" of this wire. :-)",

But I do try to get decent quality wiring for my electronics, and with speaker wire that means generally getting a higher gauge (lower number) than is absolutely necessary. I've always been very happy with 10 or 12 gauge wire, and this is a nice flexible pure copper wire that works well.

In addition, I'm going to try electric fencing around some fruit trees and around my garden to try to discourage deer (wish me luck on that one). I will run this cable underground between trees and garden. Before I do all this, i intend to try to push this somewhat-rigid cable temporarily down my septic main and use a cable locater to stake the location. Being an electrician with some high-voltage experience, I think the 15KV insulation claim is realistic, Also, I think the 2 thick layers of PE insulation will be quite tough in standing up to abrasion and the elements. My opinion is that the pricing for this 328' roll can't be beat and I recommend the product.",

      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★★ <b>Looks really good. Real tinned copper. Very slinky</b> There's not a whole lot to say about this wire that hasn't been said in other reviews already. I ordered the 12 awg with 10 feet of each red and black. I was just trying to round out my stock a bit as I already had some 10, 14 and 16 awg silicone wire around. I tend to order BNTechGo as I tried them once and was plenty happy with it. This stuff seems just as good as far as I can tell. My main concern was if it was real tinned copper or not so I stripped a section and scraped it with a sharp knife until I could clearly see the copper start showing through the tin. So yes, this is definitely real copper. The strands are extremely fine, which is great for flexibility but can make it tough to strip without cutting some. But that's the case with all flexible silicone wire, so no real issue there compared to other brands. These 10' sections came in just loose coils in a resealable pouch, which I guess is fine given how short they are; normally I prefer spools. All in all this wire seems just as good as other more established brands and costs less. Works for me.",

I hadn't opened the packaging of 15 ft cable so I was able to return it to the big box hardware store for a refund. Same number of conductors of the same current carrying capacity with significantly more length at a significantly lesses cost. I was simply amazed. Also, as luck would have it, I ended up installing two RING camera/lights using this product and the extra 10 ft made all the difference in the world. Yep, I didn't need the red conductor for the RING camera/lights, but it is in there in case I want some flexibility downstream.",
      "B0CSD35PQT ★★★★☆ <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone.",

Real stuff delivered to my door the next day is a huge win and I'll only buy my wire from Amazon anymore.",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Good flexible wire</b> These spools of wire are great. They're soft, not stiff, and they do appear to be 22 gauge. There should be 6o feet of wire on each of the 6 spools and as far as I can tell it does seem to be the case. The wire is stranded and takes solder well. Definitely deserves a 5 star rating and I recommend it!",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Versatile Electrical Wiring For My RC Needs</b> I've been replacing the wiring in my RC cars and found this wiring. It is ideal for this application. There are two spools with each being 25 feet long. One spool is red, the other black. The 12 AWG conductors are tinned to increase corrosion resistance. The heavy conductor size carries high levels of current. The silicone insulator is super flexible and is tolerant of high and low temperatures. All this at a reasonable price. Would recommend this to anyone.",
      "B001D4C2OO ★★★★★ <b>Good heavy gauge wire</b> No issues. Wire came in a 125 ft roll and was exactly what I needed to wire in my 50amp spa circuit.",
      "B0CN316VHN ★★★★★ <b>Did the job!</b> 100ft spool of low voltage 16 gauge landscape wire. Allowed me to add a separate line to my landscape lights. Easy to use & easy to clip onto & bury. Good product, good price!",
      "B0C6R2NJD2 ★★★★★ <b>Good Standard House Wire!</b> This short spool of wire was just long enough to make the run from a wall switch down to the basement and up into the attic for a bath fan install. No issues with the wire. Stripped easily and passed the smoke test! I would have no problem recommending the wire for any DIY project!",
      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Quality 12 gauge wire</b> The Fipnot spools of five assorted colors of wire is a nice kit of electronics projects. Each spool is 10 feet of wire and is individually wrapped. The wire is very flexible, and the silicone jacket is smooth which which makes it easy for passing this wire through tight spaces. This is stranded and tinned copper wire which has some benefits over stranded copper alone, such as better corrosion resistance and better soldering.",
      "B0BRB1M6M3 ★★★★★ <b>Great price for the quantity</b> I bought the 100 foot spool to completely rewire by boat accessories and this is so much cheaper than the small rolls of single strand. I used the old wires to pull the new under the deck and used cable ties and fine point marker to label each circuit so years from now I can quickly identify each set of wires. Good insulation and what appears to be quality copper strands make this easy to use and durable. I am throwing away all the bits and pieces of assorted wires I have saved for years and getting more rolls of this great wire!",
      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Super-flexible and heat resistant.</b> This is premium wire with a very high strand-count for maximum conductor flexibility. The silicone jacket is immune to soldering temperatures with no melting or creep from the heat. The solid copper strands are tinned to prevent oxidation and to ease soldering. Working with high-flexibility and heat-resistant silicone wire is a treat compared to PVC-insulated wire, but the higher cost usually makes me limit its use to special projects where there is a great deal of repetitive flexing or where it is necessary to ensure that no stresses are imposed on the joint, such as when soldering to the pads of a circuit board. I would prefer to use silicone wire for everything otherwise. You can punch holes in the cardboard box and use it as a wire dispenser. At $6 per 50ft spool for 20 gauge wire this seems like a very good value, especially compared to hobby shop prices where you can pay that much for a couple 3ft lengths. Highly recommended.",
      "B0CN316VHN ★★★★☆ <b>Hassle free for LED low voltage lighting</b> This low voltage landscape wire is a fantastic solution for my outdoor lighting project. I needed a specific length, and this 100ft roll was perfect, avoiding the need for splices. The price was reasonable compared to big box stores. It worked seamlessly with insulation-piercing connectors on the lights, and the 16 gauge is sufficient for LED lights with low current draw. Installation was a breeze, and it's only been a couple of weeks, so I can't speak to long-term durability yet. Easy to run and connect, it made our lighting setup a hassle-free process. I appreciate its ease of splicing and the ability to make future adjustments easily. Overall, a reliable choice for outdoor lighting projects.",
      "B0BXT6SBZ4 ★★★★★ <b>Good selection (colors) of 22AWG | Not for breadboards</b> I got this little spool set to replenish mine for various electronic projects/repairs. The ad (at the time of this review) is spot on, each spool is 22 gauge, 26.2ft long and contains 60 strands (yes I measured & counted them because that's what I do). The insulation is VERY pliable also, it may seem minor but the box is also a dispenser AND it comes with a handful (20 [4 each color]) of heat shrink 1-1/2\" long each. Because this is a 60 strand wire it's not for Bread Boards unless you like tinning wire. I hope this review and video was HELPFUL.",

      "B0CSD3GJ53 ★★★★☆ <b>ETL listed, just like regular zip wire but 12 gauge</b> With spring headed our way, we're beginning to plan for some landscaping improvements in our yard, and low-voltage lighting is one of the things I'd like to add, so I picked up this wire. This wire looks like your typical lamp cord/zip wire, but at 12 gauge, this is pretty stout wire. Like zip wire, the two conductors are insulated in black flexible rubber insulation and joined by a thin section of rubber in the middle, so you can easily split the two conductors apart for making any necessary connections. And like typical zip wire, one of the conductors is identified by ribbing on the exterior of the insulation; this conductor is used, by convention, as the neutral wire. I've learned the hard way that before you put any wire into service, check it for breaks. Both conductors in this 100 foot spool passed the continuity test. What else is there to like? They include a chart (see photo) that shows the maximum wattage for any given length and gauge of wire, so it's nice to have that as a handy reference. It's also ETL listed (sort of like UL listed). For low voltage applications like landscape lighting, you could argue that being ETL listed is overkill, but it's a nice thing to have regardless since it is rated for up to 300 volts. One minor nit--I wish that they had length markings on the wire like some wires do--once you start using this, it's nice to be able to know how much length is remaining without having to unspool it and find it's not enough. Again, maybe overkill for a 100' spool but that would have been a really nice touch.",
      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★★ <b>MASSIVE Value!</b> I typically cheap-out when it comes to cables for my random DIY projects; as long as the cable can safely handle the power, I don't care if it's stiff and hard to strip. But given the chance to try these, I had to. And what a difference a quality wire makes! the silicone jacket makes the wires easy to maneuver and bend but also makes stripping easier. The wires are also nicer to the touch compared to cheaper non-silicone wires. The included heat shrink is great since I don't have any of these wire colors. For the money and what you're getting, I think this is a great deal. 16 ft of wire in 8 colors is a good amount of wire length, and paired with the accessories, I think its well worth it. 5/5 stars from me.",
      "B0B5DSNSFX ★★★★★ <b>Good utility wire for auto and speaker systems</b> These are two spools of wire, one black and one red, with each spool containing 100 feet of 10 gauge stranded wire. At first glance, it looks like any other stranded copper wire, but take a sharp blade and scrape the strands to remove the copper coating and reveal the aluminum core. The wire is just a (very) little bit stiffer than what I would expect with full copper stranded but the difference is very minimal and could also be due to the wire sheathing as well. Also, these two are being stored in an unheated garage which could be adding to the stiffness. I’m planning on using the wire for auto and trailer wiring.",
      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ <b>Good quality wiring</b> Tinned strands are key in my marine environment as I do electrical upgrades to my boat. This wire has good insulation on individual conductors and the entire set of 4 conductors. As a simple test, I tested conductivity / resistance by connecting my spreader lights through the entire spool of 100' with no detectable reduction in function so it will be perfect as the appropriate lengths are in place. I'd expect this product to be great for doing sprinkler wiring, outdoor lighting, hvac, or other similar low voltage AC or DC applications.",
      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Flexible</b> The wire has a soft silicone jacket and they're very easy to work with as they're quite flexible. Each spool does seem to have 50 feet of wire included. They also seem to be right about 20-AWG and take solder as easy as can be. It's also very easy to strip which is always a welcome bonus. Great wire and is everything it's said to be. Recommended.",
      "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>Quality wire</b> I recently fenced in an acre of pasture and of course to keep my animals in and unwanted animals out several of the lines are hot. I used almost every foot of this to get from the energizer inside the barn out to the fence and from the energizer to the multiple ground rods. It's thick solid wire in a weather tight insulation. Price is close to the local farm store but they don't generally have these long spools in stock, at least not around me.",
      "B07HY1VY4X ★★★★★ <b>Convenient</b> The wire was exactly what I was looking for. It can be hard to find the right wire, of the right type, at the right size, and especially of short length. I just needed a small amount. Also it was coiled nicely, not like a small spool, which would have been tightly rolled. I'm very please with this order.",
      "B001D4C2OO ★★★★★ <b>Pleased with Purchase</b> Cable cabana shipped the product very quickly. I thought I would receive the wire bundle in Southwire wrapping; instead it came nylon strapped in a poorly wrapped box with no Southwire branding on the sheath. It looked to be decent wire nevertheless and my electrician had no qualms with using it so we installed it. I ordered the '125 coil and had about 6' left, so my field measurements were good. Overall I am very happy with the product and using it for a new spa.",
      "B0CRSXG3L9 ★★★★★ <b>You'll Need This Wire For 2-Way Switches</b> We purchased the Romex Simpull Solid Indoor 14/3 W/G NMB Cable because we installed hallway lights and needed to turn them on and off at either end. To install 2-way switches and have them work properly you need a cable with 3 conductors with a ground wire. We got a 100 foot coil as we plan on installing other 2-Way switches for the kitchen, dining room and den. Working with the Romex Simpull Solid Indoor 14/3 W/G NMB Cable was easy and fast. We highly recommend it.",
      "B0B28M2C5K ★★★★★ <b>High quality LV cable for an affordable price.</b> If you are looking for a professional, 3-conductor direct burial cable, this is the cable you’re searching for. The individual conductors are pre-tinned, which makes soldering quicker and easier. It's easy to handle and store the 100 foot coils. The cable is also UL Approved and Listed. It's great for wiring split wired landscape lighting, which is what I use it for most of the time.",
      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★★ <b>Excellent 18 Gauge 8 Color Stranded Wire Spool</b> If you're looking for some 18 gauge hook up wire than this is an excellent option. This package comes with 8 different spools each of a different color. Each spool is 16.5 feet long. This is great hookup wire. You also get a package a package of zip ties and shrink tubes.",
      "B0CNXJ9H6Q ★★★★☆ <b>Good Quality and Value</b> I like repairing and building guitars from left-over parts. One thing I’m always in short supply of is wire. Red is mainly used for the hot wire to the input and black is used for ground throughout the guitar. One thing I like about this wire is the red and black are fused together but can easily be separated. It means you can run a short length of about 18 without a messy tangle of wire, separate the ends where they solder to the tabs. The wires are pre-tinned, so once you remove ¼ inch of the sleeve, you can solder directly without taking more time fiddling and tinning yourself. You get 20 feet on a small spool which can easily be slid onto a rod with other spools of colored wire and hung above your workspace instead of cluttering drawers. Good quality and value.",
      "B01B6R0OKQ ★★★★★ <b>Use to protect Starlink cable</b> What I disliked is actually a good point. It was hard to open the product to get the Starlink cable inside. Fit perfectly once inside. Only used a short section about 16”-18” where the cable ran over the edge of my metal roof. Would buy again if needed. Still have a large portion left from the order.",
      "B07GH7JHG9 ★★★★★ <b>Easy spool out of the box, and flexible cable.</b> Glad I bought the 1000 Ft Spool, just had enough will look at more in the future.",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Super flexible</b> This collection of 16 ga. wire (6 spools-20ft. per spool) is great to have on hand for any automotive or RV repair. The wire is super flexible due to the silicone insulation and the multi-strand wire. The wire solders easily though the twisted strands should be tinned before soldering. I twisted the strands and crimped 16 ga. connectors. The twisted wires fit the connectors and crimped properly. I could not pull the connection apart. It would have been nice to have had a hole in the spool to keep the wire from de-reeling, but an 11/64 drill bit took care of that. The seller specs the current rating at 20 amps-600 volts AC. 16 ga. wire in 12VDC applications ranges from 8 to 10 amps depending on length, and 13 amps in AC applications.",
      "B0C6R2NJD2 ★★★★★ <b>Standard 14/2 electrical cable</b> This is the standard #14 copper electrical cable spec'd for power in your house. At a 25' length coil, it will be suitable for extending one circuit or adding a light or outlet. You will need a longer coil to do much else. Strips easily and cleanly. Even though you could save a few bucks by using copper-clad aluminum cable, get all-copper cable like this and you will have fewer problems down the road with connections.",
      "B071NP99CN ★★★★★ <b>Flexible and Reliable: The BNTECHGO 24 Gauge Silicone Wire Spool</b> The BNTECHGO 24 Gauge Silicone wire spool is a must-have for anyone in need of a high-quality, flexible wire. With 250 ft of black stranded wire, this spool offers ample length for all your wiring needs. The 24 AWG gauge ensures a strong and reliable connection, making it perfect for a wide range of applications. I highly recommend this product for its durability, flexibility, and overall great value.",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★☆ <b>Good quality wire.</b> I needed 14 gauge wire for a project and ordered this when I saw it was available as a Vine item. It arrived as pictured, on two 40 foot spools. I also needed it to be high temp wire. This is rated at 200 degrees Celsius which converts to 395 degrees Fahrenheit, way more than adequate for my project. The silicone casing is very flexible and strips cleanly. The wire is indeed copper, you can tell when you cut it. I had no problems soldering it to the connectors. It has performed without issue. This is a high quality wire that worked extremely well for my intended use. I would order this again if I need more in a different gauge.",

      "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★☆ <b>Good quality 6-conductor copper stranded wire.</b> BOTTOM LINE: 1. I recommend this NAOEVO 16 gauge 6 conductor electrical wire 50 foot coil. 2. The current price of ~$66 is reasonable. LIKES: - Great quality for low voltage uses. - Good temperature profile. - Tinned copper. - Working well for connecting 2 buildings for a low voltage application. DISLIKES: - The individual copper wires sort of float inside of the outer protective plastic sheath. This leaves a somewhat sloppy appearance."

      "B0BRN8DWTL ★★★★★ <b>Heavy duty and UL rated.</b> This is safety-approved UL, SVT, 300V, VW-1, 105C, 18 gauge, PVC jacketed two conductor cord wrapped in a braided jacket to give it an antique appearance. I'm not sure the Amazon listing made it clear that this is UL approved, but it is. I measured the outside diameter at .225\", and peeling back the Rayon cover reveals a round white PVC jacket that is .210\" diameter. The PVC makes this cord rugged but also quite stiff compared to true antique (and less safe) cloth-covered cord that was usually just one or two cloth layers wound directly over the two individually-insulated conductors, but without the extra molded PVC jacket. Vintage cord used on lamps, radios, and other electrical devices usually was a little less bulky, more flexible and sometimes had an oval cross-section rather than round. This cord is well-suited for modern retro lighting and restoration applications where extreme flexibility and the ability to hang naturally under its own weight over short lengths is not a requirement. For greater flexibility, twisted cloth-covered cord is available from other sources. This has each PVC coated conductor individually wrapped in cloth and the pair of wires twisted together, yielding greater flexibility. Several years ago I had to buy cord like this for an antique replica that I built, and I paid a lot more buying it from an antique radio part supplier. This is a high quality product with safety approvals at a very good price. Highly recommended.",

The jacket is about the thickness I expected for an outdoor wire that can be buried. I would not hesitate to use this buried for low voltage lights. The strands seem uniform in diameter when stripped. I've wired many outlets and lights in mine and others homes over the years. I'm also a retired IT tech so I have worked with large to small wires.

      "B079NXCN6B ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Terrible adhesion renders the product useless</b> I bought 2 rolls of this cable, one with 2 conductors and another one with 4 conductors to wire my surround speakers. The cable is VERY finicky. You are supposed to flatten the cable, terminate it with the terminals (extra), test the cables before gluing them and clean the wall very well. So I spend about 3 hours doing all the prepping, and then installing it, with a hairdryer and a plastic card to flatten the cable as I went. Everything went pretty well and I was able to enjoy a movie that night. My plan was to add texture and paint the next day. The very next day I woke up to half of the cable detached from the wall. Total disaster. Re-installing it is a total pain. I contacted support and they told me that the textured wall shouldn't be a problem and to try again. What I did was to redo the installation in the baseboard. The results, after a couple of weeks, has been the same. The cable is starting to detach in some areas and now I'm wondering if I should add a stronger glue (very messy) or change cables (after the big investment on these ones). The idea is great, but in order to install this, be prepared to need to use additional glue and refinish the cables to add adhesion, otherwise this is not going to work.",

Unlike some low voltage landscape lighting cables, this does not look appropriate for direct burial. There are however, 2 layers of insulation to the cable: color coded (red and black) insulators on each conductor and a thicker protective insulator on the exterior. The wire gauge is quite light at #18, so it is especially good for LED lights which don't draw much current. I would also feel comfortable using it on a single halogen fixture at 20 watts or less. Overall the thin profile of the cable lends itself to being able to tuck it away easily and out of sight. I will likely be using it under a deck to power LV light fixtures.",

I also had to get adapters to connect to the surround sound unit because the wires that came with it were not 16 gauge. I was careful to go slow and make sure to press the wire firmly against the wall. Waited a few hours, then painted over it with no issues. Sound quality is the same as before. Can't tell the wire is there unless the light hits it at a certain angle. Definitely a great choice for hiding speaker wire. Photos show before, during and after installation.",

Even running low voltage wire is just ridiculously expensive especially if you run to one of the home stores. Ad frankly , if you're ordering wire without knowing what it is or seeing/feeling it, it can be a little scary as the quality varies so much. This wire arrives on a wooden core. Okay - that makes 500ft of heavy a little heavier, but you know they care about their product. It's also probably the only way to ship it so it doesn't end up as a bundle of knotted wire when it arrives in your standard Amazon box which in my case was shipped through UPS and clearly had a tough ride. But 500 feet of wire is pretty heavy at about 22 lbs on a 10x10-ish core. And the wire made it fine with a nice sheet of cardboard wrapped around the wire in between the core ends. The box clearly won over whichever UPS employee was fighting with it. The wire just feels like quality. It''s a firm, yet flexible outer sheath holding the two separate strands of 16 gauge wire. The sheath is UV resistant and rated for direct burial. It's UL listed and RoHS rated. It seems like a quality product and for purposes it's great. My use case is extending an existing low voltage run along the side of the property of the house to the back and introducing low voltage lights to the back yard. In southern Florida, the groundwater is high, the weather humid, and the sun hot. What better test ground for this? Anyhow it's ultimately gonna be buried under landscape rocks yet above landscape fabric in most places. Others will be direct burial In certain spots known for puddling. I expect no issues given the quality of this wire. And at 16Awg I expect it to be able to carry the 12 volts I need without concern. Highly recommend.",
      "B0BXKLS2T4 ★★★★★ <b>Heavy and flexible</b> Heavy enough for battery loads on the riding mower and flexible enough to make them easy to route. Great quality, so far.",
      "B0CG1GSW3P ★★★★★ <b>Good Solid Copper Wire</b> This wire is heavy. Exactly what you'd expect for 10 guage wire. It is copper, and not copper coated. The jacket is not overly thick, but seems to protect well. It feels a bit soft. More rubbery than most vinyl coated wire I've used in the past. I like that though because it has less memory and is more flexible. This wire would be perfect for automotive or other low voltage work. Finally, I feel the price is decent. Copper is still stupid expensive, and yet this wire manages to be an ok price. I dig it.",
      "B09MRWVJN8 ★★★★★ <b>Excellent quality. Substantial weight and easy differentiating with 2 colors</b> I stumbled across this wire while looking to create a 50 ft extension cable with MC4 connectors on each end, to attach a portable solar panel setup to a lithium battery power system. I've used lots of low-voltage wire but I've never seen any of it with black and red insulation together like this. The wire itself was good quality, the insulation was thick and flexible, and it worked perfectly for what I was trying to do. Will definitely by this brand again next time I need a similar cable.",
      "B0CSD35PQT ★★★★☆ <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone.",
      "B07T19567J ★★★★★ <b>Looks high quality</b> The last time I purchased thermostat wire, I bought the low priced one and regretted it. The wire broke easily. A few bends and it would start to break. Can't believe they can sell crap, but they do. This wire has a high CMR rating, what ever that means and much better than the generic stuff. I noticed a difference when handling the wire, noticeably heavier. Looks like what you would expect. Worth the extra money in my opinion. Just changing a thermostat and breaking the wires in the process, wondering is there enough extra length to do what should be a simple job or do you have to spend the day running new wire.

Insulation is average.</b> This review is for the 10 Gauge, 15ft, 2 conductor Arrives in a zip bag with a Made in China barcode sticker on it 614.7g (1.35Lbs) I believe that 30ft of 10ga copper should be 0.0306hm at 77° F I measured 0.0326 Ohm at closer to 70° F, and that cooler temperature should have skewed the result lower. But at such low impedance difference I can’t say that the wire is not in compliance with its rating Jacket claims 200° C temperature rating Some odor but nothing out of the ordinary I concur with other reviewers here that the insulation is average at best. Four stars but that is half based on the competitive price of $26 for 30ft 10ga. If you are looking for fine strand flexibility, this is great. If you require a high voltage rating or other confidence in the performance of the insulation then you should look elsewhere",
      "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★☆ <b>Seems good, but lacks expected compliance markings</b> This is massive wire - 16AWG / 6 conductor … it's about 1/2\" in diameter, and surprisingly heavy. I'm a little concerned - the jacket is a PVC tube, not molded to the internal conductors in any way, and bears no markings - cable like this normally carries various markings indicating its flammability/flame-resistant characteristics, and so forth - but this cable bears no such markings. That makes me wonder if it meets all of the relevant standards and such. I certainly wouldn't use it in any application where that sort of thing were important.",

Oh, and it's kinda heavy of course, but mine arrived fully in tact and without concerns at all",
      "B07T19567J ★★★★★ <b>Quality cable</b> When unpacking the cable from the packaging you could feel is a quality product, by the weight of the cable.

      "B0CK4WHWBY ★★★★★ <b>Pure Copper Wire! It Appears To Be Well Made. I'm Happy!</b> I started working on my project this afternoon, using this wire! This is copper wire, NOT CCA wire (copper coated aluminum). Each lead, red and black have a substantial insulating cover. In addition, both leads/wires are surrounded by another insulation layer that binds everything together. The finished product is round and smooth. This is designed as a direct burial wire. That means it can be used outside, including in the dirt just as it is. However, remember to make all connections perfectly watertight. Part of my project will have the wire exposed to direct sunlight. So I feel certain it will hold up for a long time. Today I made connections using this wire by soldering as well as crimping connectors. I was super pleased with how it performed. Thanks for reading my review!

      "B07Y7S1BRN ★★★★★ <b>Illuminate Your Landscape: Quality Wire for a Brilliant Outdoor Experience.</b> In the realm of outdoor landscaping projects, the quality of materials is paramount. And in our recent endeavor, the direct burial landscape light wire we procured became a star player. Boasting robust construction, it met our criteria both in terms of price and performance. The industrial-grade PVC insulation is a testament to its durability, ensuring longevity even in demanding outdoor conditions. As a 2-wire product, it further simplifies installations. A thoughtful touch is the distinctive design of each wire: one side is smoothly finished, while the other bears grooves, making identification a breeze during setup. However, there's one aspect where the product could be enhanced — its packaging. The wire is sheathed entirely in plastic, and accessing it requires completely removing this protective cover. This might sound like a minor quibble, but when you're deep into the intricacies of landscaping, unwrapping the wire can become a tangled chore, leading to unintended project delays. In conclusion, the landscape light wire has much going for it, and I'd consider repurchasing it for future projects. But a packaging redesign is to facilitate easier unspooling and more convenient storage.",

The cord looks as good in person as the photos show. It is a reasonable facsimile for either replacing antiquated electrical wiring in old lamps and such, or adding a little extra visual flair to current devices. Of course, when replacing old wiring, you are also gaining the safety of a cord that is using modern insulating materials, which is much safer at this point, than older wiring which may have very dry and brittle insulation layers between the strands of wire. The only comment I can make about it that may be a negative factor for some is that the cord is round, rather than most lamp cord that tends to be a bit flattened. This may also have something to do with this cord being a little stiffer than the typical lamp cord you may be most familiar with.",
      "B0BGS5GRSK ★★★★★ <b>Good product.</b> Decent wire for the money. It came with a bunch a zip ties and pieces of shrink wrap which was a nice bonus. The sheathing is a bit of a mixed bag for me. It's fairly thick and tough which is good, but the thickness does make it a bit less flexible than other wire of it's type I've used. It's also more rectangular than round so the flexibility suffers somewhat when trying to route it in tight spaces and makes it more difficult to use with a standard sheath cutter for round cable. The wire itself is good, the coating should help keep it from degrading over time. I would also prefer it came on a reel instead of wrapped and held with Velcro straps, but it's not a big deal. I have a bunch of reels from 3D printing filament and wound it up on one and it worked out well. So overall it's a good product for the dough.",
      "B079NXCN6B ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Started peeling off in less than a day</b> It doesn't stay stuck to my wall. I followed the instructions and watched the video beforehand. I wiped the wall with a damp microfiber to remove any dust and let it dry. I then applied the Ghost Wire starting at one end, peeling about a foot of the backing off at a time, smoothing it and rubbing it to the wall. Working the wrinkles out as I went along. Within one day, both ends of the run had about 6 inches peeling off the wall. Three days later, and both ends are now peeled off about 2 feet. Every morning I've tried to rub it back to the wall. My walls do have a very slight orange peel texture. Perhaps on a smooth finish the Ghost Wire would adhere better. I have not attempted to paint over it yet (and likely won't since it doesn't stay on). The total length of my application was 11.5 feet. Beyond the issue of it not remaining adhered, there were a couple other issues as well. First, there's about 1/8 of clear adhesive which is not covered by the white surface material running down the entire length of the roll. This is very visible (and sticky feeling). I was hoping that I could spray some wall texture over it since paint will likely not cover it correctly. I also snapped off my exposed ends when attaching the end connectors. Since the copper is very thin, any etching done with a razor blade to cleanly expose the copper strips weakens it to the point that any flex will shear it off. I had to peel back and use scissors, leaving a small flap rather than a nice clean transition. My Ghost Wire also was quite wrinkled from being rolled up. The manufacturer states that it's a known issue and recommends a heatgun/hairdryer to remedy so I expected that going in I liked the idea of this product. If it would have stayed on the wall, it would have been great. Even with the problems I had, I could see this working well if run under a carpet. I'm contemplating using a router to notch a shallow channel in the drywall and then just mud over the inserted wire. [update] A week later, and it's completely peeled off.

Inside contains 8 various colors of wire which is exactly what I need to keep track of which LED's I will be soldering to different positions on the board. Also, because these wires are tinned, it makes soldering much easier and the solder adheres well for a solid connection. I mainly work with 5 volts, and I've had no issues with any lights. This wire is a great value as it will last for many future projects!",
      "B0CK4WHWBY ★★★★★ <b>Reliable and Durable Outdoor Wiring Solution</b> One of the standout features is its robust construction. The wire is encased in a flexible PVC jacket that not only makes it durable but also ensures it is waterproof, oil-proof, and UV-resistant. This is a crucial aspect for outdoor installations, providing peace of mind that the wire can withstand various weather conditions without compromising its integrity. The 18-gauge thickness is perfect for low voltage applications, such as LED lighting and automotive speakers. The stranded design adds flexibility, making it easy to work with and allowing for smooth installations even in tight spaces. Additionally, the direct burial capability is a notable advantage, eliminating the need for conduit in certain situations. I found the cable easy to strip and terminate, making the installation process straightforward. The overall build quality instills confidence in its longevity, and I appreciate the attention to detail in its design. In summary, the 18 Gauge Electrical Wire has proven to be a reliable and durable solution for outdoor lighting projects. Its waterproof and UV-resistant properties, combined with the flexibility of the stranded design, make it an ideal choice for anyone seeking a high-quality cable for low voltage landscape lighting and other outdoor applications.",
      "B07B44M71X ★★★★★ <b>Works well</b> I used these in a camper to land some large wires. They have a plastic base but it works fine as long as you don't over tighten it. I had no trouble with them",
      "B0CK4WHWBY ★★★★★ <b>Heavy Duty</b> This is really nice wire. Stranded copper already tinned making it easy to solder. The jacketing is flexible yet really durable. Took a couple passes with the wire strippers to get it through the outer jacketing. The inner wires jacketing was also thick. You can easily see that this wire can handle being buried if needed. The 18 gauge can also handle quite a bit of current if running lighting (or even speakers). Little on the expensive side...but keep in mind that this cable is made for outdoors and/or direct burial and that is definitely what you are getting for you money. If you need to run a cable outdoors, do yourself a favor and get the right wire to do the job. Nothing worse than trying to save money only to have something short (or catch fire) on something cheaper. This is worth the price for what it does...",
      "B0CK4WHWBY ★★★★★ <b>Good quality three-conductor wire</b> This wire appears to be quite well made. The jacket is especially flexible and is supposed to be rated for outdoor use. The wire itself is tinned copper so it's pretty decent quality. There's truly a lot of applications for this kind of wire, but I'm going to use it to wire LED lights onto my truck. Overall, I think it's a good quality and good value for the money.",
      "B0CNXJ9H6Q ★★★★☆ <b>Nice generic standard vinyl two color 20 AWG.</b> I've been using this wire to hook up small DC motors. Strips and splits line any vinyl 20 gauge ware and for the price this is a nice hunk of wire I'd recommend for anyone. Only issure I had preventing 5 stars is there are no markings on the wire specifying it's rating. That's why I only feel it's good for low demand uses like I'm using it for.",
      "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ <b>Decent quality wire in a nice package.</b> This wire bundle specs out as advertised, which is always nice. The conductor insulation is sufficiently thick to provide decent protection, without being difficult to bend. The PVC jacket containing the bundle is also decently thick, while being nice and flexible. It has a glossy finish which looks nice, but does attract dirt/contaminates. All this combined makes this six-core bundle rather easy to run for the overall size. My kit did not include the heat shrink or zip ties as advertised, but I'm not bothered by this since I have my own high quality supplies to use in place of these items.",
      "B0C65LQYPP ★★★★★ <b>Excellent speaker wire</b> Received the wire in a spool today. 14-2. Insulated in white ourter viny. Good quality copper wire. I'll be using for my speakers, but this will work on any small projects, such as 5V solar panel. Feels solid.",

      "B0CK4WHWBY ★★★★★ <b>Makes life easy for running wire!!</b> For the application I needed ..... this wire having the black/red wires encased into a single line is a blessing. Makes running, fishing a tucking a LOT easier. The wire appears to be of good quality and takes solder easy. The best part is the coating around the two internal wires. It is good quality, flexible and well bonded to the internal wires. Definitely recommend this product!",
      "B07JZC2MVM ★★★★★ <b>This is rated to go inside walls</b> Smooth jacket is easy to pull thru ENT tubing, quality plastic jacket. Ideal for wiring my low voltage lighting.

      "B08V4L3H2H ★★★★★ <b>ok</b> Might be a little old, or the makers charactor of plastic. See no issues at all with it. Would buy again. I could be wrong also, been awhile since wiring something and stripping back romex.",
      "B0CN9FNFZC ★★★★★ <b>Excellent cable, a bit overkill for thermostat</b> This is a very good cable, perhaps overkill for thermostat wire. It has 8 conductors and a very thick PVC jacket. The strands are of tinned copper (See image where I scratched off the tin coat). Colors on the strands: White, Black, Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Yellow, Brown. There is plenty of chalk when removing the outer sleeve. Chalk is used to keep moisture out, which makes it less combustible. It's not riser rated though. Marking on the cable: ESHENG PAI STYLE2497435P 2464 18AWG 80ºC 300V VW-I 1 A 18AWG 80ºC 300V PTI TRIUMPHCABLE So, a legit, good quality Triumph Wire (China) cable sold under a seemingly random name. It's exactly as described on the listing. Keep in mind that this is stranded wire and the jacket is a bit thick. It's very flexible, so it does work as a thermostat wire although overkill. Because it's stranded, it's not as quick working on it as a solid wire. So not ideal as a thermostat cable, but a quality cable regardless.",
      "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ <b>Great Value For 4-Conductor 18AWG Wire</b> What’s not to like about this wire? The flame retardant and IP68 ratings make it ideal for automotive use and the 18AWG copper conductors are suitable for many related applications. The black PVC jacket has a glossy finish, so be aware if you have aesthetic considerations. Each of the four wires have nicely tinned copper conductors and the red/black/yellow/blue colors are common to many circuits. You can easily strip the external black PVC and use the individual wires as needed. This is a solid deal for a combined 200’ of 18AWG wire for less than $40. The included zip ties and heat shrink were a nice bonus.",
      "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ <b>Quality wire in a durable jacket</b> I acquired this cable to wire some repair some existing lights and add supplemental warning lights on my tractor. Wire for rear tractor lighting needs to be run along the underside where brush, sticks, briars claw away at it constantly. More than once, I have had wiring damaged or destroyed. I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications. I really like this wire, and I look forward to using it to upgrade my tractor warning lights in preparation for spring. It would be equally suitable for use on a mowers or trailers as well. I think this product will provide adequate protection for wiring in a tough environment for a long time. In fact, with good end connections, I am hopeful that it will last as long as the equipment."

When I removed the old doorbell button I noticed that the wire cover was, lets say, very old. The wire was covered in cloth, not plastic, so I knew it was OLD. So I though replacing the wire would be a good thing for the new video doorbell. The 18 AWG Gauge Electrical Wire was the right tool for the job. The wire is very well marked so you get it right when connecting it up. The copper strand ensures good current flow. It was easy to pull and the video camera is getting a good current that in turn helps it work. The 100' of 18 AWG Gauge Electrical Wire more than met my needs and as very easy to work with.",
      "B0BRN8DWTL ★★★★★ <b>Perfect to rewire my antique lamp</b> Antique lamps and fans are often wired with cotton insulated wire. Even when they have a plastic underneath, this plastic often predates vinyl, and may crack and split. These wires become an electrical shock or fire hazard. I've been meaning to rewire an antique art deco lamp whose power cord has started to worry me. I haven't done so because the wire I had, with visible plastic insulation, would look out of place on the lamp. This wire, with a rayon covering over the round plastic insulation, will look just fine. As you can see in the photo I uploaded, the wires are copper colored, not tinned as described in the product description. Tinning is the process of coating the copper wire with solder, which would make it silver colored. Tinning reduces the oxidation or corrosion of the copper, but unless you live in a marine environment, it probably won't be a problem.",
      "B01LWNZ18M ★★★☆☆ <b>Hard to use if you need to shorten the wires</b> When you need to cut the wires back it's very difficult with the type of material. I used these to rewire a hanging light and didn't want the fabric material in the box since it looks flammable. But cutting back the cloth without damaing the wires is very difficult. I would probably have chosen a different product since the cloth material isn't very good and frays very easily."

      "B0BRN8DWTL ★★★★★ <b>Beautiful wire</b> I recently purchased the Helunsi 32.8ft Cloth Covered Lamp Cord to rewire the lamp sockets on an antique Wurlitzer jukebox and I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed with this product. The quality of the cord is excellent - the cloth covering feels durable and gives the cord a vintage look that almost perfectly matches the original. I can't wait to get some time to continue my restoration and install this eye candy in my jukebox. The covering on this wire appears to be braided very well and the ends were taped which ensured that it arrived without any frayed fibers. This wire is round, whereas the original was kind of flat, however, given the price ($17.99 .55/ft at time of review), this wire is a bargain and while it may not be exact, it is much safer than the 75 year old wire that is in it, and it looks just as good. Overall, I highly recommend the Helunsi 32.8ft Cloth Covered Lamp Cord for anyone looking to make a vintage looking lamp or rewire an antique. It is a high-quality product that is sure to make your project standout",

This cord I used on a pair of weighted swing wall lamps. These are my absolute favorite style of lamp next to the saucer-look pull-down ceiling lamp. I have two of those as well! Anyway, the lampshades are the two-tiered fiberglass shades with the \"whip stitching\" along the edges. The fiberglass shades are a beige color so the brown electrical cord goes really well with them and the gold swing piece that is attached to the wall. Of course I also replaced the plug with a new one as well. Now I don't have to worry about any kind of cord shorting/electrical issues and can enjoy my old lamps, but with new cords!",

Luckily, a variety of providers have arisen over the past few years. Here we have one where most of the work has been done for you, with the AC plug already connected. Now there's no question that this is a contemporary AC plug, and if you're doing a genuine restoration, you probably won't go this route, but there's also no question that this is a safe approach and one that is probably going to be hidden by furniture anyway. In this case, the fabric wrap covers two independently insulated wires, already stripped and soldered and ready to be wired directly into your device, lamp, appliance, etc. The fabric has a nice sheen and looks great; I picked the brown color to go with a copper lamp - works perfectly.",

      "B0BRN8DWTL ★★★★★ <b>Nice vintage wire for restorations and more</b> I originally got this to fix several lamps that I have been wanting to rewire and it's been great for that. One reviewer mentioned that the wires are not actually tinned; that is true. It's not a big deal when you are rewiring a lamp but it probably should be removed from the description. Once I rewired my lamps, I found that I love the vintage look of the wire so I decided to make some \"vintage\" extension cords using repro antique plugs and some new old stock surface mount receptacles. They look really cool, and they don't spoil the vintage look of my room and my lamps. Just remember that this is 18 gauge wire so you don't want it to be carrying more than 15 amps. Overall, I really like this wire and it's a simple way to keep that vintage look without having to use dangerous old wire. It's a great value and it does the job admirably."

Low price per foot for small projects.</b> Measured as almost no resistance over the 10 foot length and passed a basic continuity test. Silicon wrapping is at least as thick as the wire. Very flexible. I didn't notice any defects in the insulation. No issues with the product. I like the red/black pairing to keep polarity straight. This is somewhat of a commodity item. At the time of this review it had a decent price ($9) for 2 10ft lengths that, at least for me was the perfect tradeoff of being able to get a lot of smaller projects done without overbuying on quantity.",

      "B07RRPFSZ1 ★★★★★ <b>Nice, flexible, tinned copper wire.</b> I bought this wire for a project on my boat. For marine application, tinned wire is a must to prevent corrosion and flexibility makes it much easier to route through the tight spaces in a boat. I found it easy to work with and did exactly what I needed this wire to do and the tinned copper should inhibit corrosion. Color coding was helpful as it was easier to determine each lead as compared to one with just a tracing line or textured jacket. I bought both the 16 and 18 gauge wire and both are the same except for the wire gauge. Worked quite well for my project and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase more. If you need a marine grade, flexible wire, give it a try.",

The other side is white.",
      "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Really nice wire</b> As a DIYer and Handyman, I frequently find myself in need of various lengths of wire for projects and repairs. Since it's often useful to color code different connections, this five-color pack of 16 ga wire from Fipnot is good to have on hand. The package includes five spools of very nice quality wire with five different color insulation used. Each spool has 20 feet of wire. I really like the insulation on this wire. It's a soft silicone vs vinyl which I most often used in the past. This gives the wire great flexibility, as well as heat and abrasion resistance. The most commonly used red and black (for positive and negative DC wiring) are represented, as well as white, blue, and yellow. The wire consists of (according to the ad) 252 individual tiny strands of tinned copper wire. I didn't order this pack for any particular purpose in mind, but rather to have on hand when needed. Good to know that when the need comes up I'll have it \"in stock\" rather than having to run to a hardware store of home center!",
      "B07CWQ6JPB ★★★★★ <b>Decent Wire</b> Basically you're getting a total of 200' of wire, one black and one red. It's attached if needed or can be separated with a quick snip and pull. The stranded wire is tinned which is an excellent feature at this price point. You can see my pictures as to the quality. After a quick strip I soldered for effect. Excellent solder connection with no issues. Yeah, yeah, it's made in China. Go ahead, try to find US made stranded copper wire AND tinned at this price. I triple dog dare you.",
      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★★★ <b>Plenty to like about this wire.</b> This wire from TZMOIK is exactly as described and pictured. This fine stranded, silicone coated 2 conductor wire has a lot going for it. Very high quality product. OF copper and silicone is about as good as it gets for this type of wire. I have looked very closely at it for flaws and found none. One conductor is all red and the other has a black stripe on it. I am rewiring the compressor side of one of my Heat Pumps which requires 10 gauge wire as it draws 30 amps @ 120v. It's only a 7' run from the disconnect box so I can cut the wire in half and use one of the conductors from the second half as a ground. It's going in conduit so weather, elements and critters are of no consequence. Still, it's good to know I'm using very good wire. The heating element in the Heat Pump draws 60 amps and requires 6 gauge 3 conductor wire. I finished that last week. I see this wire as a very good deal and a total win for me. I can 100% recommend this product."

This didn't happen with the red coated wiring. Now I have to rewire the entire run. Update: This wire has made for a lot of additional work and expense. The corrosion from the wire got on the connectors and made the connectors unreliable so they have to be tossed too!

      "B0BYNNJS8B ★★★★★ <b>Good Quality, High Temp Wire</b> I work on a lot of electronics requiring 12-gauge wire and recently procured this wire for a couple of my projects. I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful.",

There are 2 conductors(black and white), plus a ground. They are all in solid copper wires. Good quality and good use indoor for pulling extra max 20A circuit to an outlet. Last but not least, it is UL listed, extra safety in mind. Basically, it meets my expectations as well as what it describes in the product description.",

Manufacture isn't playing any games with wire gauge and they measured right in at 22AWG. Prefect for electronics projects. Came in a nice little spool that makes feeding it out really easy.",
      "B0CPPWBGT8 ★★★★★ <b>Good value on UL 2464 cable</b> Not mentioned in the description, but this is UL2464 cable. It has high strand count tinned copper conductors, making if flexible, easy to solder, and resistant to corrosion. It is evident from its weight that it is copper and not copper-clad aluminum. I also stripped some insulation off, and I could see the copper color where the tinning scraped off. Good wire, recommended."

      "B0C5F4T9J4 ★★★★☆ <b>Flexible and well made</b> Flexible and well made. Seems a little smaller than 22g, but could just be the insulation and tight strands inside. Insulation is nice textured and thick but remains flexible, which is a plus. I did however use shrink wrap connectors and noticed that the insulation has a low melting point, so some melting occurred when applying heat to shrink the tubing, using a heat gun. I would not use a flame or torch as a heat source, but with a heat gun you can get it hot without melting insulation. All in all, well made and perfect for hobbyists.",
      "B0C5F4T9J4 ★★★★☆ <b>Insulation will Char Easily</b> I like everything about this wire with one exception, I use shrink wrap tubing on a lot of my projects and I really appreciate it when I have wire that won't scorch when I apply heat. This wire will char very quickly if you use a small butane torch as a heat source. I intentionally lit some of it on fire to see what would happen and it extinguished itself very quickly so I feel like it's safe to use in most applications. The wire itself is really nice, it's surprisingly flexible for a 4 conductor wire and the strands are tough enough to take some bending without breaking off. This is going to be my go-to wire for a lot of applications, I'll just have to live with the charring."

      "B0BRN8DWTL ★★★★★ <b>Heavy duty and UL rated.</b> This is safety-approved UL, SVT, 300V, VW-1, 105C, 18 gauge, PVC jacketed two conductor cord wrapped in a braided jacket to give it an antique appearance. I'm not sure the Amazon listing made it clear that this is UL approved, but it is. I measured the outside diameter at .225\", and peeling back the Rayon cover reveals a round white PVC jacket that is .210\" diameter. The PVC makes this cord rugged but also quite stiff compared to true antique (and less safe) cloth-covered cord that was usually just one or two cloth layers wound directly over the two individually-insulated conductors, but without the extra molded PVC jacket. Vintage cord used on lamps, radios, and other electrical devices usually was a little less bulky, more flexible and sometimes had an oval cross-section rather than round. This cord is well-suited for modern retro lighting and restoration applications where extreme flexibility and the ability to hang naturally under its own weight over short lengths is not a requirement. For greater flexibility, twisted cloth-covered cord is available from other sources. This has each PVC coated conductor individually wrapped in cloth and the pair of wires twisted together, yielding greater flexibility. Several years ago I had to buy cord like this for an antique replica that I built, and I paid a lot more buying it from an antique radio part supplier. This is a high quality product with safety approvals at a very good price. Highly recommended.",
      "B07TFF9FTM ★★★★★ <b>Ultra flexible wire, 200C, great value!</b> Very happy with this wire set -- great value, and it's what the listing says it is. Be sure you know what you're buying. This is ultra flexible, with many super-fine strands and silicone rubber insulation marked 200C (higher than PVC but lower than PTFE). The fine strands (150 of them, but I didn't count!) can be a bit of a challenge when crimping contacts... make sure no microscopic strands escape the crimp -- then it works great. The insulation is thick but soft: very easy to work with but also easily damaged if used in the wrong application. It's the right cable for routing in tight locations, since it's so willing to bend and lay flat... good for DIY drones (flexing arms or retracting legs) or making wiring harnesses that need to flex but are well protected from abrasion and pinching. For more rugged high-temp insulation, consider PTFE but it is much more difficult to work with and hard to find at a reasonable price. As noted by others, some colors are a bit off. Red is clearly orange, and blue is gray-purple. That's okay for my purposes, but maybe not if you are building to a print for assemblies that will be inspected. The velcro wraps keep each spool neat, and the box is good for organizing these spools when lots of other wire spools are around.",
      "B0CN9FNFZC ★★★★☆ <b>High-quality and flexible low voltage wire but a little smaller than true 18awg wire</b> This wire seems to be a high-quality wire with a nice and durable jacket. The wire is nice and flexible, even with the durable jacket. This wire features 8 different color conductors, black, white, red, yellow, blue, green, orange, and brown. After stripping the jacket back and revealing the conductors, I noticed the conductors seemed to be a little smaller than the true 18awg wire I am familiar with. As mentioned in another comment, this seems to be the case with this particular wire, as proven by another reviewer's wire resistance test. The following is printed on the wire's jacket. ESHENG PAL STYLE249743SP 2464 18AWG 80°C 300V VW-1 I A 18AWG 80°C 300V FT1 TRIUMPHCABLE Overall, this wire seems to be great wire for many low-voltage, low-current applications where an extra level of protection is needed such as automotive LED lighting, marine LED lighting, etc. Although the wire doesn't seem to be a true 18awg wire, it will function well for a wide variety of applications, assuming the wire is not expected to carry the full 18awg current.",
      "B0CN9FNFZC ★★★★★ <b>Excellent cable, a bit overkill for thermostat</b> This is a very good cable, perhaps overkill for thermostat wire. It has 8 conductors and a very thick PVC jacket. The strands are of tinned copper (See image where I scratched off the tin coat). Colors on the strands: White, Black, Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Yellow, Brown. There is plenty of chalk when removing the outer sleeve. Chalk is used to keep moisture out, which makes it less combustible. It's not riser rated though. Marking on the cable: ESHENG PAI STYLE2497435P 2464 18AWG 80ºC 300V VW-I 1 A 18AWG 80ºC 300V PTI TRIUMPHCABLE So, a legit, good quality Triumph Wire (China) cable sold under a seemingly random name. It's exactly as described on the listing. Keep in mind that this is stranded wire and the jacket is a bit thick. It's very flexible, so it does work as a thermostat wire although overkill. Because it's stranded, it's not as quick working on it as a solid wire. So not ideal as a thermostat cable, but a quality cable regardless.",

It is ironically rated at 80℃ 300V and then listed as low voltage wire. Which one is it? There is nothing low at 300V! We actually used it to run outdoor backyard lights and it was so easy to work with this wire, very moldable and elastic in tight corners and easy to get any angle needed out of it. However, with a 100 feet roll there is a lot this wire an be used at. Planing on using it on the bike to wire some accessory lights with a switch as it is very well protected wire and would work great on a bike!",

Just my preference. I use this wire and Teflon wiring in my projects.",
      "B0C4GXNNBD ★★★★★ <b>High quality UL rated wire with high strand count, excellent flexibility</b> It is a pleasure working with high quality wire like this four conductor cable.

The exterior insulation is the loose type - you could cut a piece and pull out a red or black to use as a single conductor. Last I saw 25 feet of Romex was selling for about 50 bucks at the big ugly orange store, at the time of this writing this is selling (with coupon and promotion code) for about 30 dollars. That's about 60 cents a foot for 2 conductor 12 gauge tinned copper wire. It doesn't have a ground wire, but I would be comfortable using it anywhere a ground was available nearby, and certainly if I didn't need the ground. This wire is rated for 300 volts. Don't know how it would fair for inspections, but I never cared for inspections - so, i just don't order any of those. 5 Stars for The Oududianzi 12 Gauge, 2 Conductor Tinned Copper Wire",

      "B0BPLQ3PWN ★★★★☆ <b>Pretty Standard Zip Cord</b> I ordered this to replace the buried wiring for my low voltage landscape lighting. The old wiring was sized to handle incandescent bulbs, which I have now replaced with LEDs. That wire was pretty stiff to begin with and has only gotten more so in the 45 years since it put it in. This wire looks like the usual zip cord, it is flexible, the insulation is fairly thick, and resistance measurement shows it to be consistent with 18 awg stranded copper wire. Barring rodent attacks, it should stand up well. It would also be fine for speaker wiring and, because It is actually rated for 300V, you can use as 110V lamp cord. However, be careful to stay within the current rating, which might make it chancy for many appliances. The description says that it is tinned copper; that’s obviously not true but also irrelevant. The price/foot is quite low reasonable so I’d recommend it.",
      "B0BWY3JGGV ★★★★★ <b>This wire assortment is ideal for both electronic hobbyists and technicians.</b> Each wire contains 40 copper strands, surrounded by silicone insulation rated at 600 Volts. The 40 individual strands make the wire very flexible, which makes routing them through tight spaces easy. The conductors come pre-tinned, making soldering quick and reducing the chance of having cold solder joints. The six spools of wire come in a compact cardboard box that doubles as a dispenser, preventing the wire from un-spooling in your toolbox or bag. There is also space inside the box to store a small number of colored wire ties and the wire stripper that comes with the wire. This wire is a quality wire at a very affordable price.",

I bought the package of 6-color 28 AWG Solid wire. Not the silicone variety, not stranded. Have measured the tinned core diameter to be 28 AWG. Clear lettering on the PVC insulation says 300V. So, it is basically as advertised ... but still, not exactly what I wanted. For bodging and wrapping electronic projects, it is better to have thinner insulation ... the jacket on this wire is exceptionally thick for the gauge. It is impossible to fish this through PCB journals without drilling them out. Still, it will be useful, as wraps nicely around posts, and seems a good value. Am left a little puzzled though, what the industrial application is for a thin wire like this, with such thick insulation.",
      "B0C5BLQ327 ★★★★★ <b>Fully compliant, reasonably price 12/2AWG</b> This is 12/2 w/g (with ground), NM (non-metallic)-B (building), 600V (will not overheat at voltages ≤ 600 volts) cable. It is widely used in dry, hidden (not exposed), interior locations and is commonly referred to as Romex (invented by Romex in 1922 and listed by the NEC in 1926). It is the standard for most applications. It cost the same as Southwire and less than Romex. If you have any doubt, this cable is, in fact: 1. Underwriters Laboratories Listed (UL) 2. National Electrical Code (NEC) compliant, 3. ASTM International (ASTM) compliant (formerly known as American Society for Testing and Materials) 4. National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) compliant 5. Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) compliant 6. Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) compliant In the US, 12/2 is used on 20A circuits (14/2 on 15A circuits). On paper, on a 20A circuit, this cable can handle 2400W. However, the NEC has much to say (Article 210) about load limits under various conditions. BTW, one can use 12AWG on a 15A circuit instead of the money-saving 14AWG. The NEC does not disapprove but some inspectors will say no because it may confuse homeowners who see 12AWG wire in the control panel connected to a 15A breaker and change the breaker to a 20A breaker. Then too, some inspectors make it up as they go. Anyway, compliant 12/2AWG to satisfy most residential wiring needs.",

The cable is made from high quality materials and feels very durable and sturdy in my hands. It has an SOOW 600V rating and is designed for use with motor leads, portable lights, battery chargers, stage lights, and machinery. One thing that I appreciate about this cable is its flexibility. Even though it is made from thick, heavy duty wire, it remains easy to bend and maneuver. This has made it very convenient for me to use in a variety of different applications. Additionally, the three conductor design makes it easy to connect to devices that require multiple inputs. Overall, I would definitely recommend the GearIT 14/3 14 AWG Portable Power Cable to anyone in need of a reliable and versatile electrical cord.

I bought this product as I only needed about 15' to finish a project - the length was right and was far cheaper then anything else I found online or in store (HD, CTC, HH - Canada). UL rating should be fine in Canada. 1st - this wire is a much lighter wire and insulation then what should be the equivalent 12/2 NMWU. 2nd - the ground wire is molded into the sheathing making it difficult to separate and strip your hot and neutral wires (black, white). 3rd - this wire feels more rigid then 12/2 NMWU, making me wonder about copper content. And finally, this wire is rated for 600 V where 12/2 NMWU is rated for 300 V (as is 14/2 NMD90) - this does NOT change the Amperage rating. - so not sure why. Above is 14/2 NMD90 (top), UF-B 12/2 (middle) and 12/2 NMDU (bottom). I don't know if this is standard in the US, but as noted in previous review, the 25' seems inadequate.",

      "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>Good quality cable that comes on a convenient plastic spool</b> This RiteFENCE Electric Fence Double Insulated 16ga Underground Hard Cable seems like good quality direct burial, double insulated, electric fence cable comes on a nice heavy plastic spool. The two layers of insulation strip cleanly and easily, making connections to the galvanized steel inner conductor simple. With this larger roll (100m/328 feet) I can extend the garden fence to include some nearby fruit trees as well. I also plan to use it to add to the grounding system for better shock effectiveness. One thing that should be noted is that the listing describes this product as: “16 Gauge Class 3 Galvanized Steel wire, Insulation Rated Up to15,000 Volts. Resistance 56 ohms/mile”. This 16-gauge product is actually 161 Ohms/mile; it is the larger 12-1/2-gauge conductor that is only 56 Ohms/mile. Other than that, this seems like a good product and a good value for the money.",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Assortment of colors makes it easy to keep circuits identifiable</b> This is a set of 6 different colors of tinned copper wire that came on individual spools. This is a great set to have on hand for use with projects that I will need to wire in the future. The colors of the silicone covering is easily visible and identify. I'm have not used wire with thus type of shielding before so I was skeptical. I opened one spool and put it to the test. I knew that tinned wire was easier to solder and offered less resistance and works great for wiring projects. What I didn't know was the silicone covering. After opening the spool I found the covering to be very flexible. It was more maneuverable the other wire I had worked with. It kind of felt like plastic and rubber blended together. It claimed it would withstand high heat and extreme cold. I used my lighter and it took a long time to melt the silicone. I then put the wire in the freezer and after freezing it was still very pliable. This set also came with different colored zip ties so if you need to keep different wires together in a group going to one place these come in handy. This is a great set to keep on hand and I'm sure you will be happy with every project you use them on. They offer so much more then other wire's I've used in the past",

This isn't a high strand copper wire, but looks to be copper, and meets the 14awg size it claims to be. The casing is nice for hiding against walls, and provides nice protection. Overall, a decent spool of wire for the money.",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Extra flexible lite gauge wire</b> So this wire is everything it says it is it has a tinned copper core with the newer style high temp silicone jacket if your not familiar with the silicone insulation jacket the biggest difference is it is much more flexible than traditional insulating materials an by more I mean alot more this stuff bends with no bounce back but will easily straighten back out if necessary it also claims to have a higher temperature resistance which was easy to prove using a lighter to strip one end it definitely took alot more time an direct flame before it was hot enough to strip compared to traditional covering it also came with 6 different colors on nice sturdy plastic spools as stated an it also came with small some zip ties to secure wires so overall I think the slightly higher price of this wire is definitely worth it if extra flexibility is nessacary for what you are using it for I also believe the higher temperature resistance is a big plus to protect your expensive electronics an this set has 6 different colors to choose from making it easy to color code multiple curcuits an the tinned copper core is more conductive, holds up longer an makes it easier to solder",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★☆ <b>individually tinned strands !</b> It appears that each and every strand of this wire is actually tinned, not just simply ran through a tinning process as a bundle of wire. What I mean to say is these strands look to have been tinned before they were twisted together at the factory. Much better process than what the description portrays. Each wire comes on it's own individual plastic reel, but they are not labeled. The actual wire sheathing IS labeled with the wires size and capacity. Speaking of the wire sheathing, it is very SOFT, leading to a wire that's very flexible but at the cost of abrasion resistance. You can easily strip the sheathing from the wire with your finger nails. The box of 6 colors I ordered came with a small number of small colored zip ties that correspond to each color of wire in the box, a very nice touch.",

      "B0C65LQYPP ★★★★★ <b>easy to use</b> This high-quality wire is made of 14 AWG copper-clad aluminum and comes in a 100-foot length with red and black conductors, enclosed in a high-quality PVC jacket. It's rated CL2 for in-wall use and complies with fire safety regulations for safe installation within walls. The wire exhibits excellent conductivity, high mechanical strength, and various beneficial features, including flame retardance, resistance to aging, acid and alkali resistance, and damp-proof properties. It's easy to strip and cut to any length needed, making it versatile for different applications. The wire is conveniently wrapped around a hard plastic spool for easy dispensing. It features two jacket colors, red and black, to quickly and easily distinguish polarity, and numbered markings for accuracy. The flexible jacket material allows for easy twisting and extending as needed. Each conductor is color-coded and enclosed within the white CL2 outer jacket, ensuring safety for use within residential class building walls. I've personally used this wire to replace my car's speaker wiring, and I'm pleased with its performance. The copper-clad aluminum core maintains good audio quality, making it an excellent choice for speaker wiring. It's relatively soft and easy to work with, and the durable outer jacket ensures long-lasting use.",
      "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>Insulation is robust and strong, conductor is galvanized steel.</b> This is some tough wire. The outer diameter is just over 1/4\" - (0.275\"), the conductor is 0.098\". The transparent inner insulator was not measured as it is well bonded to the outer black insulation. The transparent layer is much thinner than is shown in the listing pictures. Still, this is about the most robust direct burial high voltage fencing wire I've used. I'd have no concern burying this in rocky soil. The reel comes with clear plastic wrap to hold the wire snug. However, they didn't use enough of it so the outer two layers of wire unwound like a clock spring. Recommendation overall - excellent deal!",
      "B0CNXJ9H6Q ★★★★★ <b>Great for small projects</b> I ordered this wire for one of my daughter's science experiments. The ten foot roll is the perfect size for small projects. This wire comes neatly wound on a plastic spool and shrink wrapped to avoid oxidation. It has a high quality PVC shield, which isn't very easy to strip. It provides plenty of insulation. The thick shielding causes this wire to spring off the spool, so as soon as I opened it, I had to rewind it and secure it with a rubber band. The wire is properly marked and is UL listed. This seems to be high quality wire, but I have limited experience with electric wiring. Fortunately, this is the perfect size for testing, and it is available in other length options, so it's worth experimenting before committing to a larger project."

Yes, it may carry 36 amps for a while but it's going to get real hot and at some point fail or start a fire - silicone jacket or not. Here in the U.S. Code requires the use of 10 gauge wire for 30 amps. Any load on this 12 gauge wire that exceeded 20-22 amps would fail inspection. Keep that in mind when using this.

It's nice to have 5 colors to work with if you're dealing with multiple circuits, and its kept tidy on the small spools. Certainly not the cheapest option at $6/20' roll, but all wire is expensive right now with copper being so high. When costs are high, might as well get some quality for your money and this will fit the bill."

      "B0C9H1G52F ★★★★★ <b>Works well - Good value</b> All copper products have gotten to noise-bleed pricing of late. Even running low voltage wire is just ridiculously expensive especially if you run to one of the home stores. Ad frankly , if you're ordering wire without knowing what it is or seeing/feeling it, it can be a little scary as the quality varies so much. This wire arrives on a wooden core. Okay - that makes 500ft of heavy a little heavier, but you know they care about their product. It's also probably the only way to ship it so it doesn't end up as a bundle of knotted wire when it arrives in your standard Amazon box which in my case was shipped through UPS and clearly had a tough ride. But 500 feet of wire is pretty heavy at about 22 lbs on a 10x10-ish core. And the wire made it fine with a nice sheet of cardboard wrapped around the wire in between the core ends. The box clearly won over whichever UPS employee was fighting with it. The wire just feels like quality. It''s a firm, yet flexible outer sheath holding the two separate strands of 16 gauge wire. The sheath is UV resistant and rated for direct burial. It's UL listed and RoHS rated. It seems like a quality product and for purposes it's great. My use case is extending an existing low voltage run along the side of the property of the house to the back and introducing low voltage lights to the back yard. In southern Florida, the groundwater is high, the weather humid, and the sun hot. What better test ground for this? Anyhow it's ultimately gonna be buried under landscape rocks yet above landscape fabric in most places. Others will be direct burial In certain spots known for puddling. I expect no issues given the quality of this wire. And at 16Awg I expect it to be able to carry the 12 volts I need without concern. Highly recommend.",

      "B0CWNBZ164 ★★★★★ <b>Just the thing for so many differnent projects</b> My wire came rolled on a 6\" or so diameter plastic spool, in a resealable bag (appears to be a static bag). What a deal... just perfect to both use and store, sits flat and doesn't take up much room and stacks well. Great start... The outside insulation jacket is a very thick PVC material, it wasn't real easy to cut so it shouldn't nick easily (think of a errant nick from using a wire staple). Even though it's a thick jacket, it's super pliable. The inside wire insulation both cuts and strips more easily than the outside and is easy to work with. I only hesitate saying a joy, because it sounds to corny... There's about a million different uses and projects that this wire would be perfect for, you'll certainly run out of wire before you run out of projects. It is NOT house wiring or electrical supply to anything... it's very small, 22 gauge is tiny.. In a house, it would be doorbell or maybe 'ring' style wiring (or alarm sensors), garage door buttons & sensors, not for lights or outlets, extension cords, etc.. Most people probably realize that - but I'm saying it here, just in case... Save yourself a trip to the local hardware and just keep a roll of this on hand. You'll be so happy to have it at the ready when needed.",
      "B0CWNBZ164 ★★★★★ <b>It's as awesome as wire gets. Good price. Pleasant to work with.</b> There's just not a lot to say on this. It is flexy and easy to work with. It doesn't tangle/bulge internally and it coils sensibly. My wire gauge confirms it's 22awg. I plan to use this in my hobby of LED lighting controllers where this works well to send data, ground, and +VDC (5, 12, 24) to the strands from each transformer. I was pleased at the way this is packaged. Instead of being on a spool that explodes with released tension when uncoiled, this is on a larger plastic spool that's easy to \"tie off\" for reuse and very closely matches (coincidence?) the spools that LEDs come on, allowing them to live harmoniously in a box or standing on end in a file cabinet. The sheath strips nicely. The wires tin well. The cable doesn't sproing into a garage door spring at pressure when released from the package to use. It's a good price. If you need wire at the specifications listed, it's hard to go wrong here. While there are a number of variables involved, the required math is pretty straight-forward. 22G is about 43.4 ohms per km or 0.0434 ohms.per meter. Your project may not be running all channels at max brightness on all bulbs (RGB...and sometimes W) at the same time or it may be doing so for only a fraction of a second. Doing it for hours inside a packed conduit is different than an air-gapped conduit or being in the open. Just doing some quick math, let's imagine a 241 WS2812 project (like a Hexagon or a short strip) where each bulb is pulling .60ma per bulb (full intensity, white, and eye-torching white ON) That's a 14.5 W fixture at 24V, so you can use 22 gauge wire like this to drive 283feet and still lose only 1VDC at 24V. (It's worse at low voltages - this is why you want high voltages if wire length matters. It's the reason the power company lines to you are at 10's of thousands of volts....) If you're just doing boosters into taps, I'd imagine the distance to be even longer. 22Gauge is a good tradeoff of \"easy to work with\" and \"enough copper to deliver your electrons without resistance\" (hahahhaa. Ohm's Law jokes never get old.) I also did a spot test on painting it and it seems to take paint acceptably well. Some of this spool is probably going to end up in a permanent fixture that's tucked/painted into a corner of mine. This cable seems to be everything it claims to be and a nice set of specs for consumer lighting. Not fusable strands. Not chunky/expensive solid copper. Recommended.",

It’s composed of tinned copper strands. I measured its resistance and came up with 0.045 ohms for the 16.4’. That is equivalent to 2.74 ohms per 1000’, which equates to just over the resistance for 14AWG wire. Amazon Vine sent this product to me for an honest unbiased review. Would I recommend it?

(I had to make do in my last long-wire-hook-up project with a much more fragile unjacketed twisted-pair. ) • This jacket appears to be fairly tough, and I have little doubt that it will suffice for careful outdoor use (although the un-pigmented white vinyl will probably eventually degrade substantially in sunlight). • This white vinyl jacket strips cleanly using the number 10 hole in a pair of stripping pliers, ostensibly making it easy to work with. See the applicable attached photomicrograph. • The cable comes wound on a large diameter spool, tentatively facilitating its use. So far, this cable appears to be a high quality product, and I see no reason not to give it five stars. If I find out otherwise during long-term use I may revisit this review."

      "B01KWBPC7M ★★★★★ <b>Very decent wire. In depth review & Pics</b> Running some permanent LED strips in the living room vaulted ceiling. Needed wire to run through the attic from the LED strips to a controller about 22 feet away. Wanted something heavier than the 22 gauge wire you find everywhere, and I wanted 100 foot spool Those two combinations limited what was out there. Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white). Even with my current strips, would have been nice to be able to upgrade without having to re-run wire. Oh well, happy anyway!",

It's a solid18ga copper wire, as measured with my stripper, that is safe for longer runs. Less expensive 5 wire products on Amazon claim to be 18ga but are actually 20ga, which is not up to code and not recommended especially for runs over about 15 ft. This wire handled and stripped well and there were no defects except the plastic spool arrived broken because Amazon shipped it in an envelope instead of a box.",

The gauge appears accurate; the insulation seems to be high quality and is not overly stiff; the wire is easy to strip. Other little things I like: The wire spools have holes on the sides, rather than through the spindle, making it much easier to use them to prevent a full-ish spool from unraveling. The spools arrived wrapped in reusable hook-and-loop cable ties rather than the more typical, annoying to open plastic shrink wrap. The cardboard dispenser box is actually sturdy, and the holes are well-placed and the right size for the wire. It will absolutely be a good long-term storage solution for the wire. It would be hard to be less than impressed with this product. When it comes to basic breadboard-compatible hookup wire, this one appears to be the one to buy.",
      "B0B1CVFG6N ★★★★★ <b>Very good quality</b> I purchased this wire for long speaker cable runs and was not disappointed. It comes on a sturdy wooden spool and the wire, unlike most, is solid copper strand instead of copper-clad aluminum. For outside landscape lighting use, it's ideal as the cheaper copper-clad aluminum wire WILL corrode at the connections. Worth the marginal higher cost. As speaker cable, it's ideal."

      "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★☆ <b>Nice assortment of wire for electronics bench work; don't go by current rating provided, though</b> I'm a hobbyist maker who creates and repairs electronics, including microcontroller and IoT projects. Having an assortment of wire on hand helps ensure I'm using the right wire for the job both in function and appearance (color coding). This assortment includes 8 spools of silicone insulated 18AWG wire in different colors, along with heatshrink tubing and wire ties in matching colors which is a nice touch for neater, more professional looking wiring jobs. The spools are included in a box with holes to allow for dispensing, but the spools lay flat in the box -- not on edge like other boxes of dispensable wire I have. This isn't really an issue, just an odd choice and it makes the box a bit wider and flatter compared to a vertical orientation. Also included is a very basic wire stripper, though I don't use it as I have more capable wire strippers at hand. I would tend to challenge the specs/rating sheet included. Generally I wouldn't suggest anywhere near 22A be run through 18AWG wire. More like half that, tops. While the silicone insultation will help reduce the chance of fire from an over current situation compared to PVC or other materials, it will still get very hot and is a grossly inefficient application of power, with so much energy being lost as heat due to the resistance of the wire. Further, seeing the recommendation here could lead the inexperienced to conclude that's a safe current for any similarly sized wire. Otherwise, I'm quite satisfied with this product.",

Cost is always a consideration when working on projects. What is CCA wire? It’s a copper cladded aluminum wire, meaning that the outer layer is coated with copper while the inner core is aluminum. How does CCA work? The copper clad aluminum isn’t going to have the same conductive or durable performance as a pure copper, but it is pretty good. What’s to like? For non mission critical projects, the advantage of a CCA wire is cost as it is less than the cost of pure copper. What’s not to like? It’s not as durable and it has a higher resistance than pure copper. In conclusion, if you’re working on lots of non mission critical low voltage projects, the CCA wires can be a great cost saving while still getting decent performance. That said, I’m giving this product 5 stars.",

I don't know if this is a thousand feet total or a thousand feet per color or 250 meters either way... and I don't care because it's more wire than I'm likely to consume in my lifetime, doing point-to-point wiring on tiny cigarette-pack-sided circuit boards. It may be PCV, but it strips exactly like Tefzel does and as far as I can tell it would be entirely suitable for use wire-wrapping, especially if you solder your wraps like you really should if you're confident in your schematic. This wire is less likely to tarnish than standard silver-plated wire-wrap wire. It's just the right size for data-level or small-signal connections to transistors and ICs, which move very little current and cannot overheat #30 wire. Any smaller and it would be difficult to work with. Plan your project carefully, so that you never need to solder immediately adjacent to the insulation... because this insulation will absolutely not tolerate soldering temperatures like Tefzel will.",

Maybe it's just me, but trying to keep the spools from unwinding while putting them back on the dowel and feeding them through the little holes in the front was a pain. I used a big rubber band over the front to hold the wires down once they feed through and that seems to help, except for the orange one which unwound everywhere. Otherwise, this is good wire. It resists melting pretty well at high temps while soldering and with a small twist and tinning it forms good points for contact."

      "B07TFF9FTM ★★★★★ <b>Ultra flexible wire, 200C, great value!</b> Very happy with this wire set -- great value, and it's what the listing says it is. Be sure you know what you're buying. This is ultra flexible, with many super-fine strands and silicone rubber insulation marked 200C (higher than PVC but lower than PTFE). The fine strands (150 of them, but I didn't count!) can be a bit of a challenge when crimping contacts... make sure no microscopic strands escape the crimp -- then it works great. The insulation is thick but soft: very easy to work with but also easily damaged if used in the wrong application. It's the right cable for routing in tight locations, since it's so willing to bend and lay flat... good for DIY drones (flexing arms or retracting legs) or making wiring harnesses that need to flex but are well protected from abrasion and pinching. For more rugged high-temp insulation, consider PTFE but it is much more difficult to work with and hard to find at a reasonable price. As noted by others, some colors are a bit off. Red is clearly orange, and blue is gray-purple. That's okay for my purposes, but maybe not if you are building to a print for assemblies that will be inspected. The velcro wraps keep each spool neat, and the box is good for organizing these spools when lots of other wire spools are around.",

This is really finely stranded wire, and the silicone insulation both make it super-flexible. It may see incidental contact with engine parts, etc., so the temp rating (200 C) may be useful. I was soldering this to copper-coated steel clips, so I was really doggin' the heat to it to get a good joint, and the insulation which was butted to the terminals didn't shrink back or burn at all.

The 14 gauge dead soft copper round wire on a spool is good (very good quality, packaged well, speedy delivery, etc,) but due to a mistake on my part, I should've taken into consideration that even with dead soft wire, any copper wire larger than 18 gauge should be coiled. It's just so much easier to straighten. I could anneal it but that's extra work and cleaning I don't want to deal with so I should've spent the extra 3 bucks on their website for a coil with 10 extra feet of wire. Again, this was MY FAULT because I didn't want to spend $3 extra because I thought it would potentially be ok on a spool but it's much harder to straighten the kinks out.

      "B0CGQ29J9Q ★★★★★ <b>Perfect for outdoor speaker wire.</b> I like listening to music when I’m outside working in the yard. I move a column speaker outside and connect it to a small PA amp. The flexible KWANGIL 16 AWG wire makes this process much easier than the stiffer 18 AWG speaker wire that I had previously been using. As an added bonus, this wire is UV stable and also tinned to protect it from corrosion. And the tinned wire is super easy to solder. KWANGIL even supplies the coil with an end cap on each wire end to keep the wire in perfect condition until it’s ready to be used. The 20 feet of wire is supplied wound in a ~7 ½ inch coil and packaged in a sealed plastic bag. Thanks to the large size of the coil, when the wire is unwrapped it lays fairly flat unlike wire that has been tightly coiled. Stripping the outer jacket was just as easy as the listing said it would be. I stripped 4 inches from one end with no problem. Stripping the individual wires on the other hand isn’t as easy. The insulation on each wire is tight but that also keeps moisture away. Stripping ½ inch took a bit of work, stripping 1 inch I found easiest to do in two ½ inch pieces. The wire works great with the speaker and is easy to coil when I’m ready to put the speaker away."

Additionally, the wire is easy to strip, making installation a breeze even for those with limited experience. One of the standout features of this landscape wire is its compatibility with low voltage connectors. Whether you're connecting lights, transformers, or other landscape lighting fixtures, the wire works seamlessly with a variety of connectors, providing a secure and reliable connection every time. The wiring has a raised line indicating the difference in +ve or -ve side so to say, this is only for installation purposes to guide you.

      "B01KWBPC7M ★★★★★ <b>Very decent wire. In depth review & Pics</b> Running some permanent LED strips in the living room vaulted ceiling. Needed wire to run through the attic from the LED strips to a controller about 22 feet away. Wanted something heavier than the 22 gauge wire you find everywhere, and I wanted 100 foot spool Those two combinations limited what was out there. Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white). Even with my current strips, would have been nice to be able to upgrade without having to re-run wire. Oh well, happy anyway!",

Each wire comes on it's own individual plastic reel, but they are not labeled. The actual wire sheathing IS labeled with the wires size and capacity. Speaking of the wire sheathing, it is very SOFT, leading to a wire that's very flexible but at the cost of abrasion resistance.

      "B09CCK5BD7 ★★★★☆ <b>Probably not UV resistant</b> Summary: When it comes to electric power, generally the bigger the cable (lower AWG) the more efficient. Observations: Previously Vine reviewed the 10ft 12AWG cable by iGreely, and the jacket was not UV resistant as stated; after 3-months in the sun daily, the jacket faded from red to nearly white, therefore, the UV resistance claim is suspect. You can see pictures of the faded cable in my review listed below. Recommendation: Along with the largest wire, you should also go with the shortest for your applications. iGreely offers 1.0, 1.8 and 3.0 meters, so order the one that meets your need. Based on previous iGreely wire experience, I would not use this wire outdoors. Pros: Heavy duty, 1x6mm^2 (10AWG) marked. Cons: UV resistance not proven (based on similar iGreely experience).

I have read that silicone insulation has a better flexibility and heat resistance than PVC insulation, which sounds like this silicone wire will be a good choice for my project. Although great for my type of project, I didn’t see any marking on the wire (too small?) and no listing, labeling or certifications found in the product listing.

      "B0CSD3GJ53 ★★★★☆ <b>ETL listed, just like regular zip wire but 12 gauge</b> With spring headed our way, we're beginning to plan for some landscaping improvements in our yard, and low-voltage lighting is one of the things I'd like to add, so I picked up this wire. This wire looks like your typical lamp cord/zip wire, but at 12 gauge, this is pretty stout wire. Like zip wire, the two conductors are insulated in black flexible rubber insulation and joined by a thin section of rubber in the middle, so you can easily split the two conductors apart for making any necessary connections. And like typical zip wire, one of the conductors is identified by ribbing on the exterior of the insulation; this conductor is used, by convention, as the neutral wire. I've learned the hard way that before you put any wire into service, check it for breaks. Both conductors in this 100 foot spool passed the continuity test. What else is there to like? They include a chart (see photo) that shows the maximum wattage for any given length and gauge of wire, so it's nice to have that as a handy reference. It's also ETL listed (sort of like UL listed). For low voltage applications like landscape lighting, you could argue that being ETL listed is overkill, but it's a nice thing to have regardless since it is rated for up to 300 volts. One minor nit--I wish that they had length markings on the wire like some wires do--once you start using this, it's nice to be able to know how much length is remaining without having to unspool it and find it's not enough. Again, maybe overkill for a 100' spool but that would have been a really nice touch.",

      "B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★☆ <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again).",
      "B09MPZ7KG9 ★★★★☆ <b>ETL Certified, nicely packaged, performance should be as expected</b> This wire is earmarked for a spring landscape lighting project at my own home and by the way the wires in the cable feel and how easy they are to work with I expect total success. The ETL certification seems to check out online, and the cable is appropriately marked on the exterior surface as required. I ripped, zipped and stripped the wires in the cable with no problems. They twist how I typically expect stranded wire to behave. Nothing odd here. As to value, if I am reading the Amazon listings correctly cable from Frudrik is currently $100 for 265 feet, yet there is another roll of the same exact 14/2 cable by the same manufacturer, by the same seller, for the price of ($84 reg) $73 discount for 250 feet. That's $25 more for the added 15 feet (ouch). At the time I wrote this you can search \"FRUDRIK Low Voltage Landscape Lighting Wire\" and find it. All in all, the cable is good so either is probably a fair deal; one is just a little more fair! Thank you",

It is a high-quality, easy-to-use product that I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an audio cable. Here are some of the cons of this product: It is not the cheapest audio cable on the market. It is not as long as some other audio cables. It is not a shielded cable, which means it may be susceptible to interference from other electrical devices.",
      "B0C5BLQ327 ★★★★★ <b>Fully compliant, reasonably price 12/2AWG</b> This is 12/2 w/g (with ground), NM (non-metallic)-B (building), 600V (will not overheat at voltages ≤ 600 volts) cable. It is widely used in dry, hidden (not exposed), interior locations and is commonly referred to as Romex (invented by Romex in 1922 and listed by the NEC in 1926). It is the standard for most applications. It cost the same as Southwire and less than Romex. If you have any doubt, this cable is, in fact: 1. Underwriters Laboratories Listed (UL) 2. National Electrical Code (NEC) compliant, 3. ASTM International (ASTM) compliant (formerly known as American Society for Testing and Materials) 4. National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) compliant 5. Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) compliant 6. Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) compliant In the US, 12/2 is used on 20A circuits (14/2 on 15A circuits). On paper, on a 20A circuit, this cable can handle 2400W. However, the NEC has much to say (Article 210) about load limits under various conditions. BTW, one can use 12AWG on a 15A circuit instead of the money-saving 14AWG. The NEC does not disapprove but some inspectors will say no because it may confuse homeowners who see 12AWG wire in the control panel connected to a 15A breaker and change the breaker to a 20A breaker. Then too, some inspectors make it up as they go. Anyway, compliant 12/2AWG to satisfy most residential wiring needs.",
      "B0CN316VHN ★★★★☆ <b>Good for a wide variety of low voltage applications</b> First of all, note that this wire is intended for low voltage applications, including outdoors. The insulation is rugged PVC so it can be buried or exposed to wet conditions. It should not be used for 120v AC wiring. I confess that I intend to use this indoors for LED strip lighting, so the 16 gauge is overkill for me. I have complete confidence that my uses will be handled with no problem by this wire. The wire is sent on a convenient spool. One strand has smooth insulation and the other is ribbed for easily keeping the polarity right. The smooth strand has the labelling in white. The spool and the wire are both labelled as UL listed. I give it five stars because it is built for wet and outdoors conditions, and thus is more versatile.",

      "B01KWBPC7M ★★★★★ <b>Very decent wire. In depth review & Pics</b> Running some permanent LED strips in the living room vaulted ceiling. Needed wire to run through the attic from the LED strips to a controller about 22 feet away. Wanted something heavier than the 22 gauge wire you find everywhere, and I wanted 100 foot spool Those two combinations limited what was out there. Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white). Even with my current strips, would have been nice to be able to upgrade without having to re-run wire. Oh well, happy anyway!",

It is TINNED COPPER which gives the color of aluminum unless you look at the cut end of the wire. Then, you can see it is definitely copper core. You could also measure its resistance. It measures 0.031 ohms resistance in 30’. That’s equivalent to 1.033 ohms per 1000’. The standard for resistance of 10-gauge copper wire is 1.018 ohms per 100’ @ 25° C. Aluminum wire (10-gauge) is 1.649 ohms @ 25° C. My reading was at 24° C. Therefore, it’s copper wire. This wire is extremely flexible because of its silicone insulation and the extremely fine wire strands that make up the wire core. That makes it easy to work with and very desirable.

The Silicone is so 'rubbery' it's almost hard to cut and both the insulation and the wire is as flexible as the insulation. It doesn't 'hold' a shape well at all it's just so flexible. The high temp insulation makes it nice for soldering, it doesn't shrink off or split out from the heat of nearby soldering - and the temp range is also low (cold). I didn't test it, but the low end spec is -76F.. (So obviously I'd have something special around to make any claim about testing it anywhere near that.) I'll have to pickup a couple new rolls for my next trip to Antarctica (lol). It's a whole bunch heavier at 10 gauge than I normally use but I have a couple projects that will use up most of, if not all of the rolls. I'm adding fog lights to my car and I'm rewiring a couple speakers. It feels so nice that if I have any left, I may just rig up a new set of test leads for my multi-meter. Also available in smaller gauges, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 & 22, those other sizes are probably more commonly used and more in line with the size I'd usually pickup for small general purpose projects - but the fog lights, can draw a bunch of current, so for a 10 ft run in a car, this can handle >200 watts, or plenty enough for my fog lights.",

In summary the product as described is very misleading, clearly shown is on the image is copper wires (In reality it is copper clad aluminum). I read \"Multiple Reviews\" on the lower scored Amazon reviews of the Copper Clad Aluminum wiring turning to dust or cannot be soldered. The conductivity rating from NEC {National Electrical Code} for 14 GA Aluminum wire is null \"not rated\"). NEC code only starts at 12 gauge, however it does not address Copper Clad Aluminum. This Copper Clad Aluminum from the unwrapped spool, appears to be of high quality, However I am returning it for misleading advertising and the concerns with galvanic corrosion when terminating this wiring to anything but connectors certified to accept aluminum (Yes it copper clad, I am being conservative). I am concerned with persons purchasing this product thinking it is copper (look at as advertised picture). 14 GA copper is rated for 15 amps (My best guess for this wiring is 3A, After severe derating). Not going to deal with over heated wiring or wiring turning to dust. No No No, Not me!",

I've ordered directly from Copper Wire USA's website before and prefer to purchase from them (either at their Amazon store or from their website) for all my bare copper wire needs and would highly recommend them to others who need bare copper wire. The 14 gauge dead soft copper round wire on a spool is good (very good quality, packaged well, speedy delivery, etc,) but due to a mistake on my part, I should've taken into consideration that even with dead soft wire, any copper wire larger than 18 gauge should be coiled. It's just so much easier to straighten. I could anneal it but that's extra work and cleaning I don't want to deal with so I should've spent the extra 3 bucks on their website for a coil with 10 extra feet of wire. Again, this was MY FAULT because I didn't want to spend $3 extra because I thought it would potentially be ok on a spool but it's much harder to straighten the kinks out. I knew better and ordered it anyway; therefore, I will keep it and use it for texturing.",

The durability of this wire is outstanding. It's clearly built to withstand the elements, which is essential for any outdoor wiring needs. Installation was a breeze. The wire is flexible enough to maneuver around obstacles in my garden, yet it feels sturdy and reliable. I was particularly concerned about the safety aspect of burying electrical wire, but this product's robust insulation gave me peace of mind. It’s evident that it's designed to prevent moisture, corrosion, and other environmental factors from affecting its performance. The 12AWG size is perfect for my high-powered outdoor lights, providing consistent and stable electricity flow. I've noticed no voltage drops or fluctuations, which speaks volumes about the wire's quality. Additionally, the clarity of markings on the wire made it easy to ensure correct and safe installation. What truly sets this wire apart is its value for money. It's not often you find a product that offers such high quality at a reasonable price. It's a long-term investment that I anticipate will serve me for many years to come. In conclusion, I highly recommend the Zonegrace 12AWG 2-Conductor 12/2 Direct Burial Wire to anyone looking for a reliable, durable, and easy-to-install option for their outdoor electrical projects.

I've been using very similar wire, and will be using this wire, for primary power on my larger RC planes. The tinning and fine stranding make it easy to solder into various connectors and the flexibility allows this relatively large conductor to be easily tucked away inside my models. The high temperature rating of the insulation ensures that it can handle the heavy, usually short-term amperages that today's advanced RC battery and motor technology demand. I also like to use this wire for various other hobby projects where flexibility is required for making or breaking plug-in connections. It can withstand a lot of flexing due to both the fine stranding and the thick. but soft. silicone insulation.

If you look at the wire gauge chart you can use 100 watts of lights if it's 40 feet or less. Shorter than 40 feet the carrying capacity goes up more, so this is perfect for me. I ran 12v LED Headlights and tail lights on my golf cart. I ran a 12v actuated valve on this wire. I have plans for landscape lighting but am playing with solar lights at the moment so I may never get there. Funny that the one thing it is really intended for I may never use it for! I'm sure I'll have a stereo install in the future for my son and this can work for speaker wire too. Lots of low voltage uses.

      "B0CSD3GJ53 ★★★★☆ <b>ETL listed, just like regular zip wire but 12 gauge</b> With spring headed our way, we're beginning to plan for some landscaping improvements in our yard, and low-voltage lighting is one of the things I'd like to add, so I picked up this wire. This wire looks like your typical lamp cord/zip wire, but at 12 gauge, this is pretty stout wire. Like zip wire, the two conductors are insulated in black flexible rubber insulation and joined by a thin section of rubber in the middle, so you can easily split the two conductors apart for making any necessary connections. And like typical zip wire, one of the conductors is identified by ribbing on the exterior of the insulation; this conductor is used, by convention, as the neutral wire. I've learned the hard way that before you put any wire into service, check it for breaks. Both conductors in this 100 foot spool passed the continuity test. What else is there to like? They include a chart (see photo) that shows the maximum wattage for any given length and gauge of wire, so it's nice to have that as a handy reference. It's also ETL listed (sort of like UL listed). For low voltage applications like landscape lighting, you could argue that being ETL listed is overkill, but it's a nice thing to have regardless since it is rated for up to 300 volts. One minor nit--I wish that they had length markings on the wire like some wires do--once you start using this, it's nice to be able to know how much length is remaining without having to unspool it and find it's not enough. Again, maybe overkill for a 100' spool but that would have been a really nice touch.",

      "B0CP1TGHKT ★★★★★ <b>12 Gauge Wire 100FT, 2 Conductors Electrical Wire Red Black Cable, Flexible Copper Clad Aluminum</b> While these are copper clad aluminum, as opposed to all copper, they work well in low voltage situations. Good for various projects and other low voltage type applications. Not too bad of a price considering the length and gauge of the wires. 100 ft of this type of wire in all copper would cost significantly more for two conductors 12 AWG. So, for the right application, I could see using this with no problems at all.",
      "B0CTZT8MHG ★★★★★ <b>Electrifying!!!</b> The wire was perfect for my needs. I use it to power a 220v /15amp heat pump. Wire is really good quality.",
      "B0C63QKZ55 ★★★★☆ <b>Decent quality wire, insulation is a bit on the thin side</b> The insulated wire on this wire is a bit thin and may tear if feeding through wood holes. The upside of a thin insulation is its very easy to strip and work with. The wire feels on par with my local big box store. This wire should be just fine for wiring in lights. Check you local code before buying this for outlets, 12 AWG is likely required.",
      "B0CSD3KPX3 ★★★★★ <b>Nice wires</b> Purchased these wires (12 and 16 ga) to replace my solar to hardwired landscape lights. Used the 12 ga as the main power line and the 16 ga to power each individual light. Probably overkill but this way I don't have to worry about voltage drop and if I want to add additional lights or accessories the main line doesn't need to be upgraded. Check my review for the 12 ga wire. Overall nice wires to work with.",
      "B0CH2R3XNH ★★★★★ <b>Beefy copper wire</b> Nice 12gauge direct burial wire. Thick, copper core and a sort of stiff insulation rated for direct burial. I got this to power a 24V gate opener so I can keep all the main power and battery units near the house and just run the lower voltage to the opener motor. Very happy with the quality of this wire!",
      "B0C6R2NJD2 ★★★★☆ <b>14 AWG pure copper wire with marks to note usage</b> Appears to be pure copper conductor wire, 14 AWG X 2 with ground.

      "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>Nicely made</b> This underground cable appears to be quite heavy duty. The insulator is very thick which will protect it from being buried and the conductor is a nice heavy 12-1/2 gauge. The only issue I see is that it is pretty rigid which will make it a little harder to work with in tight spots, but I'd rather it be heavier than lighter.",
      "B0CBMZGNFL ★★★★★ <b>Nice wire for stuff</b> Twenty feet of 14/2 wire in a tough sheathing that is adequate for outdoor use. Easy-ish to cut/strip away the material and get to the business end of the wire. Make sure your using shrink wrap and weather tight connectors to ensure water doesn't find its way in anywhere else. Nice wire for your outdoor projects",

      "B0C65LQYPP ★★★★★ <b>Good quality wire I used for outdoor speakers.</b> Good quality wire I am using for my outdoor speakers for my backyard kitchen. I was able to run most of it underground, so it stays hidden very well. Music quality sounds great and I have no complaints. 14 ga. wire is perfect for my application. The wire is CCA which means it is aluminum wire covered in copper with copper being the better conductor. That is fine with me, as pure 14 ga. copper would probably be 3x as expensive. It is also cable rated to be run in walls.",
      "B07VFLWTVY ★★★★★ <b>Durable well made product</b> This landscape lighting wire works great. The 12 ga wire keeps the lights at the end bright. I ran over 150 feet and all work super. Very durable well made wire.",
      "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>This is some seriously heavy duty electric fence wire</b> This is a really heavy roll of wire. The wire itself is 12 ga and the insulation is very thick. This is actually thicker than anything I have ever used before on my electric fence installations. This is more than enough to bury under my gates and entrances. The advantage of using this wire is that I can bury it under all driveways and walk through gates and not worry about it being harmed over time. When I open a gate the electric fence can stay energized around the entire property without breaking the connection. Those spring loaded handles you use to break the wire and open a gate often rust out and fail. I will still use these to energize the gate itself but now I know the rest of the property is energized while I come and go. And I also have enough of this wire left over to run ground wires to my experiments and projects in my electronics lab. At only 56 Ohm per mile it will make a very solid ground.",
      "B0CBMZGNFL ★★★★★ <b>This is a nice tinned copper 14-gauge 2-conductor cable.</b> This is a nice cable with two 14-gauge conductors and in a round sheathing. The copper is tinned and appears to be true to size, based on my stripping and crimping tools. The wire is rated at 80 degrees Celsius instead of my preferred 105 degrees but should be sufficient for most uses. Recommended!",
      "B003J63662 ★★★★★ <b>Worth the money</b> Good Product and good price for this quality, arrived next day. Nice 12 gauge wire with thick insulation for the outdoor elements. Easy connection when using quick connects that pierce the wire, should last for years.",

If you see this review on a different item, then there are either multiple item options, or the listed item was changed. I picked this up to finally put my aftermarket subwoofer and amp in my car after putting it off for a long time. Often enough, a lot of audio systems are wired up using 16 or 18 gauge wire, but I wanted something thicker to transmit more efficiently and not possibly run hot, so this 14 gauge spool was perfect. At 20 cents per foot, it is a good value. Now I can't say that my ear can distinguish any difference in audio, but I like knowing the thicker wire is there and will handle whatever I throw at it.",
      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Easy to work with, well made, and really copper.</b> I ordered the black and red 30ft 14 gauge cables. I do a lot of DIY projects. I like working with low voltage with my solar setups or on my vehicle. Having different cables and wires in my toolbox always comes in handy. I've gotten wire in the past labeled copper that ended up being CCA. I can confirm that the ones I received are copper. These wires feel well made. The spool was compact. They are easy to work with. I got exactly what I ordered. I would order again for future projects.",
      "B0BZTW2XMN ★★★★★ <b>Very good cable and price point !</b> I have used low voltage cable for outdoor landscaping for many years and this landscaping wire was as good as what I had. The price point was set at a very reasonable for a 50 ft and you would get a better gauge wire compared to other big box hardware store.",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ <b>Practical kit for small wiring jobs</b> This is a convenient set of wire for small automotive or hobby projects. The wire is tinned copper, and I exposed the copper with a grinder to be sure of the copper. The tinning makes the actual wire appear silver and protects against corrosion. Very flexible and finely stranded, so it is easy to pull and route where needed and various colors for identification according to your needs. 14 gauge is typical for 15 amps or less in relatively short distances like a vehicle, and the silicone insulation is both durable and well suited for applications where moisture, oils or dirt may be encountered. Also comes with an assortment of wire ties. Note that this is not manufactured or or suitable for use in house wiring, nor is it UL Listed. Overall, a nice selection of quality wire at a reasonable price.",
      "B0BZTW2XMN ★★★★☆ <b>Great for garden/accent lights</b> This wire is very suitable for wiring garden lights. The wire is already coated properly for outdoor in ground use. All I had to do was dig a shallow trench in the path I needed my lights and then drop the wire accordingly. 50 feet is not a lot of wire but can be more than enough for a flower bed or for accent lights. The wire is easy to manage and manipulate, making setup a breeze. I was able to run the full stretch of my rose garden with the 50 foot wire with a tad bit to spare. Great for outdoor use.",

It IS NOT Underground Feeder rated. I am using it for wiring up a towing vehicle Automatic Trailer Brake controller. It is critical that this Automatic Trailer Brake controller wiring not fail so that is why I chose this wire. It has much better electrical safety ratings than all the rest of the towing vehicle’s wiring but those electric trailer brakes must be reliable. I took off one Star Rating point because of inaccuracies in the website description. One photograph shows an 18 strand conductor while at the same time stating 65 strand conductors.",
      "B07VFLWTVY ★★★★★ <b>Great wire</b> Used about 140 feet for a landscape design remodel. Ran 21 three watt led bollard lights and 5 five watt led spotlights on a single strand to a transformer.

      "B0BTDSKT51 ★★★★★ <b>Good low voltage wire</b> Good low voltage landscape wire for you outdoor projects. The wire strips fine and you can separate the two wires easily like any other. One wire has some ridges on it so you can easily tell if you have the + or - wire based on which you used for each. I have used 3 other brands and this was right in line with the others. No issues at all so far.",
      "B0CBMZGNFL ★★★★★ <b>Works great as speaker wire if you want some added protection. Not for in-wall use.</b> This review is for the Gerilik 14 AWG stranded tinned copper wire (20 feet). It comes in a plastic zip-top bag, and there is a small roll of electrical tape and what appears to be a screwdriver. I bought this to connect 4 Ohm bookshelf speakers to my 50W-per-channel stereo amp, and it works fine. The Gerilik cable's jacket is more robust than standard speaker wire, making it overkill for my application. However, I like the look and appreciate the added protection. It's worth mentioning that this \"general purpose\" wire is not rated for in-wall use.",
      "B0CBMZGNFL ★★★★★ <b>Great for automotive use</b> This wire is perfect for wiring up auxiliary lights on my truck. LED lamps have greater light output with a lower current draw, and the 14 AWG wire has enough ampacity to support 120W spot/flood combos with a bit of room to spare. Heavier loads will, of course, require heavier gauge wire.",
      "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>Heavily insulated 12.5 gauge steel wire</b> I have lots of issues with deer eating my garden produce - actually - eating everything on our premises. If it's not protected, it is subject to being a snack for the herd. I will be using this wire to extend my fencer to another garden on our property. I love how well insulated this product is - I haven't seen anything like this at our local farming outlets. It should be perfect for what I want it for.",
      "B0CPPWBGT8 ★★★★★ <b>'Bout 60 Cent a Foot</b> This is nice 12 gauge tinned copper wire. The exterior insulation is the loose type - you could cut a piece and pull out a red or black to use as a single conductor. Last I saw 25 feet of Romex was selling for about 50 bucks at the big ugly orange store, at the time of this writing this is selling (with coupon and promotion code) for about 30 dollars. That's about 60 cents a foot for 2 conductor 12 gauge tinned copper wire. It doesn't have a ground wire, but I would be comfortable using it anywhere a ground was available nearby, and certainly if I didn't need the ground. This wire is rated for 300 volts. Don't know how it would fair for inspections, but I never cared for inspections - so, i just don't order any of those. 5 Stars for The Oududianzi 12 Gauge, 2 Conductor Tinned Copper Wire",
      "B0BTDSKT51 ★★★★★ <b>LV Cable for landscape lighting</b> While 12/2 cable is recommended for complete system installations, especially with longer runs, shorter runs are just fine with 14/2 or even 16/2 cable.

      "B0BXVRKTKM ★★★★★ <b>Good jacketed duplex wire</b> I like this wire for duplex situations when you want a strong insulating jacket to protect from chafe. The 14 gauge wire is appropriate for medium amount of current, 15 amps if ac. I also used it for wiring low current dc items on my boat. The jacket should also give good corrosion protection along the run of the wire. 66 feet will go a long way on your projects.",
      "B0C5BLQ327 ★★★★★ <b>Fully compliant, reasonably price 12/2AWG</b> This is 12/2 w/g (with ground), NM (non-metallic)-B (building), 600V (will not overheat at voltages ≤ 600 volts) cable. It is widely used in dry, hidden (not exposed), interior locations and is commonly referred to as Romex (invented by Romex in 1922 and listed by the NEC in 1926). It is the standard for most applications. It cost the same as Southwire and less than Romex. If you have any doubt, this cable is, in fact: 1. Underwriters Laboratories Listed (UL) 2. National Electrical Code (NEC) compliant, 3. ASTM International (ASTM) compliant (formerly known as American Society for Testing and Materials) 4. National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) compliant 5. Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) compliant 6. Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) compliant In the US, 12/2 is used on 20A circuits (14/2 on 15A circuits). On paper, on a 20A circuit, this cable can handle 2400W. However, the NEC has much to say (Article 210) about load limits under various conditions. BTW, one can use 12AWG on a 15A circuit instead of the money-saving 14AWG. The NEC does not disapprove but some inspectors will say no because it may confuse homeowners who see 12AWG wire in the control panel connected to a 15A breaker and change the breaker to a 20A breaker. Then too, some inspectors make it up as they go. Anyway, compliant 12/2AWG to satisfy most residential wiring needs.",
      "B0CW8SL7C4 ★★★★★ <b>Useful for smoke detectors</b> I added a hard wired smoke detector to a bedroom. For most new wiring, I use 12/2, but for a smoke detector, 14 gauge is just fine. The third, red wire can be used for an interconnect. My alarm didn’t have an interconnection, but if you are putting in the wiring, it’s good to have for the future.",
      "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★★★ <b>Thick enough and still very flexable.</b> I ordered their 12 gauge wire for a DIY solar generator I am working on and this wire fits the bill perfectly for all of my 12 volt wiring.

      "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>Works great for farm use</b> The RiteFENCE Electric Fence Double Insulated Underground Hard Cable is working perfectly for use 'underneath' my 12' and 16' foot double gates that lead to my pasture. For years I have used a system where I disconnect my electric fence by hand to open my gates without getting shocked. I dug a small trench about 6\" deep under a couple of my gates and buried the RiteFENCE, and left each end protrude out of the ground about two feet to connect to one of the lower existing fence wires so as not to disconnect the continuous circuit at any time when opening gates now. I chose the 6\" depth to bury the heavily insulated RiteFENCE since in addition to moving livestock through the gates, I also drive vehicles and farm implements through the gates as well. The RiteFENCE is very sturdy and rigid, and the 12-½ gauge took some time to straighten out to fit flat and neatly into the trenches I dug and placed the wire into, but this is a definite plus for electric fence wire to be used on a farm or ranch. The RiteFENCE doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and has a thick outer coating with the inner wire apparently coated as well for the 'double insulation' aspect. When installing, I also cut back a couple of inches of the RiteFENCE on each end and used a heavy duty crimp connection to the barb wire fencing I use. Once crimped, I neatly wrapped the connections with quality electrical tape to seal from the elements. The RiteFENCE is going to be ideal for many other underground connection needs I have around the farm. I would highly recommend any farmers and ranchers who run electric fence to give the RiteFENCE a try if you want to eliminate the risk of a nasty shock, especially with the higher powered fence chargers. The price point seems very fair and in fact is actually a little cheaper than what I saw at my local farm supply store. Highly recommend!",
      "B0CPPWBGT8 ★★★★★ <b>Good value on UL 2464 cable</b> Not mentioned in the description, but this is UL2464 cable. It has high strand count tinned copper conductors, making if flexible, easy to solder, and resistant to corrosion. It is evident from its weight that it is copper and not copper-clad aluminum. I also stripped some insulation off, and I could see the copper color where the tinning scraped off. Good wire, recommended.",
      "B0CTZT8MHG ★★★★★ <b>Its Romex</b> Same Romex available at big box hardware stores, but at the time I ordered it, it was approximate $15 less than in stores.

      "B0BTDSKT51 ★★★★★ <b>Ticks off all the boxes for medium length/amps landscape lighting usage</b> Calculating voltage drop on low voltage landscape lighting is really important. One of the key parameters is the thickness of the wire, and the length of the wire. Its important that the wire be of good quality. I stripped the wire ends and used a caliper to measure wire thickness. It is 14 gauge as claimed. (14 gauge is suitable for medium lengths and amps. For longer runs, or wires that will carry a lot of amps, use 12 gauge.) Connected both wires to double the length and measured resistance using a good multi-meter. It is less than standard for 14 gauge cooper, so that is good. Flexibility is good. I like that it is US made. Competitively priced.",
      "B0CP1TGHKT ★★★★★ <b>Good wire for solar projects.</b> This 12 gauge wire is thick enough for just about any battery-operated or solar panel project around the house. The copper clad aluminum (CCA) stranded wire is lighter weight than pure copper, less expensive than pure copper, strong and flexible making it easier to work with, and you can use straight copper connectors. The dual conductor is easy to split and strip with standard tools (though a light touch may be needed to avoid nicking the copper cladding). Whether you are working on power projects like me or just wiring in speakers, you'll find this cable to be easy to work with and a good value.",

I also needed it to be high temp wire. This is rated at 200 degrees Celsius which converts to 395 degrees Fahrenheit, way more than adequate for my project. The silicone casing is very flexible and strips cleanly. The wire is indeed copper, you can tell when you cut it. I had no problems soldering it to the connectors. It has performed without issue. This is a high quality wire that worked extremely well for my intended use. I would order this again if I need more in a different gauge.",
      "B0CG1GSW3P ★★★★★ <b>Perfect for places that need thicker wires</b> Some accessories for my truck and trailer require 12 gauge wire. This fits that perfectly.",
      "B0CPPWBGT8 ★★★★★ <b>Nice low voltage cable</b> I used this 2 wire 14ga cable to run between 2 outdoor camera stations in the woods. The cable insulation seems excellent and the stranded conductors make it very flexible. Because the wire is tinned it soldered very easily. Pleased with it.",

      "B0C5BLQ327 ★★★★★ <b>Wow, it’s a deal</b> This 25’ roll is almost half the cost of the same a local home improvement stores. And delivered to my home. It’s heavy 12 gauge wire and more difficult to work with than 14 but necessary for kitchen outlets and bathrooms as well as my garage.",
      "B0C65LQYPP ★★★★★ <b>It's the little things...</b> I've slowly started to replace all my current speaker wiring with this brand. Some of the wire I was using previously was just too large to fit in the post holes of my audio equipment. The 14 gauge of this wire is hefty enough that I'm sure it's carrying a decent signal, and yet thin enough that it doesn't fray when attaching to my equipment. The outer sleeve is the perfect consistency as well, and the inner wire is \"loose\" enough inside that when cutting the outer sleeve there's little danger of also cutting the wire. It also cuts extremely easily, meaning no scoring multiple times trying to get to the wire inside. The insulation on the wires seems like standard insulation, not the gel-type thick insulation found on other brands of speaker wire. If you do a lot of wiring, this is key as a standard wire stripper works great with it - a real time saver. The clear red and black insulation is handy as well - no looking for symbols on the wire insulation, you can just tell at a glance and from a distance which is positive and which is negative, so there is much less chance of any mixup.",
      "B0C65LQYPP ★★★★★ <b>Used this for a non-audio wiring project and it worked</b> I originally picked up this wire because I had planned on running some audio cable in my car but I had to turn on a large latex printer that runs 240V and…what could go wrong? Happy to report after I twisted the two 14guage wires together, using 3 separate pieces, the printer fired right up. I monitored the wires for heat and they didn’t even get hot. After printing out the usage report I disassembled the makeshift 240V outlet and called it a day. The printer is being sold so these wires worked in a pinch without issue. On a quality note the wires are pliable, no corrosion and I can’t wait till I hear how they distribute bass in my car.",
      "B0CPPWBGT8 ★★★★★ <b>High Quality Roll of Copper Wire</b> We got the 50 ft length, 12 gauge roll of two conductor electrical wire. It's flexible and thin, and the PVC covering is waterproof. When cut, you will notice that each wire is tinned copper for excellent conductivity; one wire is red and one is black, and the PVC insulation is made to last. The set includes shrinkable tubes and cable ties. We are using this for low-voltage outdoor lighting, and it works great because it can be buried underground without fear of any damage.",
      "B0BZTW2XMN ★★★★☆ <b>Good Value if You Only Need 50 feet</b> ...Otherwise buy longer lengths to save the cost per foot. It sure looks like 14 gauge copper center and the jacket is thick, easy to cut/strip and it should hold up well exposed to the elements and buried underground. Install in warm weather though or you'll have trouble bending the wire. My only quibble is the wire is stiff - but then you do get a thick and durable jacket. As a test I put the bundle in the freezer for 5 minutes and it was very difficult to bend.",
      "B0CH2R3XNH ★★★★★ <b>Great 12 gauge wire for nearly all of your landscape lighting needs</b> When you are planning your landscape lighting design, one of the things to factor in is the distance that you need to carry the current over to the lights. This 12 gauge wire is the nice balance of size that will minimize the wattage drop that happens over longer runs. The jackets are good and easy to remove for connecting up the fixture. The wire is stranded nicely as well. Not much more to say - but this is quality wire that will perform well for nearly any design that you throw at it. Just ensure that you also get the right connectors for direct burial as well so the connection will be as good as the wire is!",
      "B0CSD35PQT ★★★★☆ <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone.",

The copper cable works well with compression fittings, but the rubber cladding is a bit soft and really flexible (which could be good or bad). I found that the flexible cable was nice for the runs that needed to wrap around things, but when I tried to make some Anderson connectors I found that the flexibility caused a lot of pain to jam the cable into the tiny press fitting, but the Crimping of compression cables was awesome.",
      "B01MR7EKGO ★★★★★ <b>Good wire that works wells.</b> I pulled this wire through both metal and flexible conduits up to a PTZ camera. I did not want it buried where it could be damaged. Pulling/pushing through the flexible conduit was a bit tricky and time consuming without lubricant but it went through the 20' along with some network cable. It easily pulled through the buried 1/2\" metal conduit. The wire is still flexible even in temperatures below 30 degrees F. Probably 12 gauge is overkill but I may install a more demanding camera, or other 12 volt devices in the future. Camera is up and operating well so I am very satisfied. Amazon handed off the package to USPS so there was a delay of a couple of days receiving this item, which was not the seller's fault.",
      "B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★★ <b>premium wire</b> This is really premium wire. Its so incredibly flexible, I love silicone jacketed wire. Not only is it flexible, but my soldering won't scorch the silicone like it will PVC jacketed wire, as silicone has a much higher tolerance for heat than PVC. I tested the resistance of each of the two strands, and both came back exactly 1.2 Ohms resistance, which means two things. #1, most importantly, the wire is not broken internally in either strand, there are no opens. #2, my volt meter is consistently lousy and at least measures off the mark twice equally. What I mean by this is that at this length, according to spec, there should be 15.88 milliohms (mΩ) of resistance in 10' of 12ga copper wire, which is far too sensitive for my cheap meter to measure. So I don't know why my meter is reading 1.2 ohms, but my guess is that is not exactly correct, and the actual resistance is functionally closer to 0 ohms. Anyway, this wire is perfect for chaining together a few LiFePO4 12V batteries in parallel for a solar-charged power station I'm building. Just got to crimp some spade terminals on and it will be perfect for my project. Also, LOL at the brand name... Dastard?? lol really?",

      "B0CPPWBGT8 ★★★★★ <b>Heavy duty 2-conductor wire!</b> I love this kind of wire! It's two wires, essentially, with a protective PVC sheathe. I love this stuff because it removes the need for corrugated PVC split-loom. The sheathe acts to protect the wires against abrasion, and if you're running wire in vehicles, with all of their tight turns and sharp edges, you need abrasion protection. I got this to run accessory LED lighting for my Jeep, but I'm considering it for running speakers as well. The individual wires are 14 gauge, which is more than enough for my craziest lighting project. 14 gauge can handle a lot of juice. Overall, this is good wire. For the price you get a decent length, and if it behaves like others of its kind, should last a long, long time.",

Made of copper clad aluminum (CCA), it offers the conductivity of copper with the lightweight properties of aluminum, making it flexible and cost-effective. The PVC insulation ensures durability, flexibility, and resistance to aging, moisture, and corrosion, with an operating temperature range of -20°C to 70°C. The 100ft length provides ample wiring for various projects, and the two-color jacket allows for easy polarity differentiation, reducing the risk of device damage due to incorrect polarity. Overall, this wire is convenient, durable, and offers excellent value for money, making it a practical choice for anyone in need of reliable electrical wiring.",

      "B0BYNNJS8B ★★★★★ <b>Good Quality, High Temp Wire</b> I work on a lot of electronics requiring 12-gauge wire and recently procured this wire for a couple of my projects. I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful.",
      "B09XQWWPD2 ★★★★★ <b>Good quality 12 gauge electrical wire</b> This wire has finer strands than your typical 12 gauge wire, so it's more flexible. The strands are also tinned so they conduct better, don't corrode as fast and are easier to solder to. I stripped the wire and crimped on several different types of connectors. Everything worked exactly as it should.",
      "B0CH2R3XNH ★★★★★ <b>Good low voltage wire</b> This wire is 14 gauge and has a low measurable resistance so is a good choice for when you have to install long low voltage runs. It is not very bulky for 14/2 wire, but that also means that you should not try and use it for 100v applications as the insulation is not thick enough.",
      "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>12 1/2 gauge class 3 galvanized steel cable, polyethylene coated. Very tough stuff.</b> I cut through the end of the insulation with my pocket knife to check for two layers. Not easy! I didn't end up going all the way around as I would normally do to strip a wire but was only able to take off a corner and that's all I wanted to try to do. It seemed more like one very thick layer, at least double normal wire insulation thickness, and much tougher. Polyethylene is not a cheap material. I expect to use a cutting wheel even to strip the ends. Inside is a single conductor which they say is galvanized steel, not the usual conductor materials of aluminum or copper. Copper would be way too expensive in this application. I suppose aluminum could crack. This is so thick it's hard for me to bend the cable with my hands. I'll want to bury this and forget it for many years, and I expect to be able to do so.",
      "B0CPPWBGT8 ★★★★★ <b>Just what it says on the tin(ned)</b> This is legit 12-gauge stranded copper wire, heavily tinned. The ends on the coil I received had apparently been re-tinned after cutting, so you couldn't see the strands. I cut the end off, and the fresh cut showed individually tinned copper strands. Dimensions are accurate, insulation appears to be of good quality, flexibility is good. Recommended!",
      "B01MTJC9M3 ★★★★★ <b>Exactly as advertised!!</b> What I received was exactly what I ordered (14 gauge stranded/tinned copper - one red, one black, each 20 feet long.) So the seller is definitely honest & reputable. I have not used this wire yet but I can already tell that it will work perfectly in the project I ordered it for. The jackets are both very supple...smooth...and the wire bends easily & nicely. So, if you have to snake it through a small opening (as I do) you should not have too many problems. I can definitely recommend this product without actually using it. I don't know where it was made (since that is not indicated on the label) - but if it is typical Chinese origin at least it is good quality Chinese material",
      "B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★★ <b>Good wire for switches, outlets and lights</b> Ever since my wife and I purchased our house, I have been in constant motion fixing and updating everything from plumbing to flooring to electrical. The home inspector we used seemed new to the business, at least that is what I'm chalking his performance up to. I am an electrician, so I know when electrical wiring is up to code and when it isn't. Unfortunately, my house is full of poor wiring, so I have been working on getting everything up to par before I need to use my generator for an emergency. The wire comes in a plastic-wrapped roll with a couple bands around it. I'm used to Romex coming in the plastic roll that you can pull out of the middle, but this wasn't as easy as that. The wire is pliable, as I would expect 14 gauge wire to be, and it stripped well. I had to pull a number of lengths through flexible conduit and it was just stiff enough to push through without a fish tape if the conduit was straight. Overall, I give this wire high marks. I did not encounter any of it that had poor craftmanship, it works great for 15A circuits, and I haven't had an issue after using about 150 feet of it. I will order more and keep it on hand."

Even running low voltage wire is just ridiculously expensive especially if you run to one of the home stores. Ad frankly , if you're ordering wire without knowing what it is or seeing/feeling it, it can be a little scary as the quality varies so much. This wire arrives on a wooden core. Okay - that makes 500ft of heavy a little heavier, but you know they care about their product. It's also probably the only way to ship it so it doesn't end up as a bundle of knotted wire when it arrives in your standard Amazon box which in my case was shipped through UPS and clearly had a tough ride. But 500 feet of wire is pretty heavy at about 22 lbs on a 10x10-ish core. And the wire made it fine with a nice sheet of cardboard wrapped around the wire in between the core ends. The box clearly won over whichever UPS employee was fighting with it. The wire just feels like quality. It''s a firm, yet flexible outer sheath holding the two separate strands of 16 gauge wire. The sheath is UV resistant and rated for direct burial. It's UL listed and RoHS rated. It seems like a quality product and for purposes it's great. My use case is extending an existing low voltage run along the side of the property of the house to the back and introducing low voltage lights to the back yard. In southern Florida, the groundwater is high, the weather humid, and the sun hot. What better test ground for this? Anyhow it's ultimately gonna be buried under landscape rocks yet above landscape fabric in most places. Others will be direct burial In certain spots known for puddling.

I'm restoring an older classic '67 GTO and making a few changes on a custom bike I built long ago. This set of '6' various color spools arrived in good time and in its own 'stronger' cardboard 'reusable' box. Upon giving a bit of this stuff a 'go test' on re-wiriing new horns on that ol' relic and the same for a new honker on the bike - this stuff worked out better than the stuff I'm used to from a few spools lying around here. U can tell the immediate difference in the flexibility of the sheathing. Like comparing thick racing engine plug wire to the cheap thin stuff. As for any soldering - stuffs great thou higher bond point u can tell its stronger. Any splices r handled with some new solder joint connectors I just happened to snatch up and this stuff worked great in those too. I did find that there is the slight possiblity of tearing open the silicone jacket of this stuff 'easier' over other types due to having easier stripping ability so yankin' on this stuff when routing any wire runs needs to b given some added care to avoid snags on anything sharp. Otherwise some great wire here and worth the lil xtra bidenbux for an overall better quality product.",

The tinned copper wire is easy to solder and doesn't oxidize, which is a good thing for my various car and trailer projects. My current requirements are usually well under 10 amps, so this 16 Ga wire will work fine for most of my applications. No negatives to report.",
      "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ <b>Appears to be true 16ga wire (unlike some others)</b> I've bought other similar spools of multi-conductor cable, and I've learned that you have to be careful about what you're getting. In one case, I ordered a 50' spool of 18 gauge wire that turned out to be a good 20% smaller, giving 20% higher resistance. So -- the first thing I wanted to check on this wire was the resistance of a single conductor through the length of the whole spool. Granted, I haven't unwound it to measure its length, so I'm taking that part at face value. The principle here is that any copper wire of a certain cross-sectional area (i.e. gauge) will have a given resistance per foot. There are many free online wire resistance calculators that will tell you just what the total resistance should be, when you provide it with the length and wire gauge. In this case, 50' of 16ga wire should be 0.201 ohms. As you can see in the photo, that's exactly what I have, within the precision of the meter I was using. It was actually flipping occasionally between 0.19 - 0.21 but typically sat on 0.20 ohms, which is pretty firm confirmation that this is, in fact, 16ga wire. Having confirmed that fact, I'm happy to recommend this cable for all intended purposes. The individual wires are easy to strip, have thick insulation, and the black outer sheath is sturdy and slick. Within each 16ga wire, the individual strands are pre-tinned, which gives much better corrosion resistance for when you're working in a wet, or otherwise corrosive, environment (like on a boat's wiring or other marine environment). Nice product, exactly as claimed.",

Two (red and black) wires with its own PVC insulation and there is a PVC outer jacket covering both. Wires are copper (NOT lower conductivity grade Copper Clad Aluminium). I made an actual count and there are exactly 27 strands. The outer jacket can be stripped off with wire stripper at 14AWG, which really indicate the wire is even slightly bigger than 16AWG. Nice wire, with good conductivity and well made. Excellent for extension or versatile use.",

This silicone cable is super hard to melt and is very flexible to work with. Will easily fit in banana connectors or other kinds as the wire is not too thick.",
      "B0BRN8DWTL ★★☆☆☆ <b>Inter core 18ga copper stands are to brittle or small to handle.</b> The wire is pretty to \"look at\", but the 5.5mm PVC outer white insulation is too thick to use in a chandler's light-arm ( that leads to the bulb). This wire should only be used for a table lamp, from the lamp to the wall plug. The other concerning feature is 18ga copper. The copper stains are too thin to work-with, they are brittle to bend around a connection screw. Soldering is required to support the stains. Why the industry has gone to such small gauge 18ga ( setting aside the min amps & volts ) is because they have never rewire an appliance. 16ga should be the workable appliance size wire.",

A+ product at a reasonable price.",
      "B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ <b>Super flexible</b> This collection of 16 ga. wire (6 spools-20ft. per spool) is great to have on hand for any automotive or RV repair. The wire is super flexible due to the silicone insulation and the multi-strand wire. The wire solders easily though the twisted strands should be tinned before soldering. I twisted the strands and crimped 16 ga. connectors. The twisted wires fit the connectors and crimped properly. I could not pull the connection apart. It would have been nice to have had a hole in the spool to keep the wire from de-reeling, but an 11/64 drill bit took care of that. The seller specs the current rating at 20 amps-600 volts AC. 16 ga. wire in 12VDC applications ranges from 8 to 10 amps depending on length, and 13 amps in AC applications.",

I was able to make a quick slit with utility blade grab the wires and tear down the sleeve to the spot I wanted the sleeve removed. I used this to wire up new DC dimmable led lamps in my warehouse. The four wires allowed me to use two wires for DC dimmers and two wires for AC circuit. I found the nearest ground and ran a ground to that. Good wire - Good Price 5 Stars",
      "B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★☆ <b>Mostly meets expectations, a few inches short, and dispensing box fail</b> This appears to be good tinned coppy wire, with silicone insultion as described. I only have two issues with this and would probbaly have dinged a 1/2 star if that was an option: I measured one of the rolls to see if I was getting 20ft, and it came up about 4 inches short. This isn't too bad for 20ft, but I expect to get every inch I paid for. Now maybe some of the other rolls were longer, but I didn't verify. If that is the case then they need to be more consistant. The second issue involves using the box as a \"dispenser\". THere are holes in the back of the box to feed the wire. The problem is if you put all 6 spools in side by side, then there isn't enough room to close the lid or for the spools to spin. They came packed with the spools in a 2x3 configuration instead of the 1x6 configuration you would use for dispensing. This is because they don't fit otherwise. Looks like good wire. So if you dn't mind being shorted a couple of inches, and don't need the dispenser to work well with 6 rolls of wire, and otherwise this is a good value for you, then this is your product. Oh yeah, it comes with some colored zip ties. <shrug> Price as reviewed $32.99 NAOEVO 16 Gauge Wire 120ft, 16 AWG Silicone Wire 20ft Each Spool, 6 Colors Flexible Tinned Copper Wire Electrical Wire 16 Gauge, Hookup Wire Kit for Breadboard/Automotive/DIY/Battery, 200℃ 600V",

It's easy and will eliminate the issue of it not sticking long term. Maybe skip the terminal boxes. They are bulky, which negates the purpose of getting this product. If you feel comfortable you can solder the wires, or just wrap the ghost wire around your other wire and wrap w electrical tape."

But man was this sheathing thick. A little much to work with. If you are doing a job that has taxing environmental issues such as underground runs or in an automobile, this would be perfect! For me though, having to manually trim the skin back was a pain. Still, it is as-advertised, so I can't take off of the rating for that. Well-made, good quality product.",

It was harder than I expected (which is to say harder than other brands) to separate the two wires. I tried to pull it apart with my fingers but finally resorted to snipping the end with wire cutters to get the split started. Even after that, it was difficult to pull them apart enough to strip the ends. The wire is easy to strip. The wire is stranded copper and is very flexible. One of the strands has ridges down the side so it is easy to tell them apart when you get to the other end of the run. This is good wire and it will work perfectly for my application.",

I found the insulation on the individual conductors to be a bit more stiff than other wire I’ve used recently. It stripped off easily using the 20AWG slot on my Klein Tools 11063W wire strippers. (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BC39YFQ). Using the sharp blade from my flush cutters, I was able to scrape away the tin and verify that the wire strands are indeed copper.

This came as a coiled roll of cable wrapped in plastic shrink wrap strips. I got the 16/4 which is a great cable to have on hand. Sometimes you need 2 wires, sometimes 3 or 4 but it's not realistic to carry around multiple types of cable to always have exactly what you need. This is perfect. I am very pleased with not only the 4 wires which are exactly as expected but the outer jacket. It's a rubbery feeling PVC that feels durable and waterproof. Currently at just under $1/ft this is priced well compared to retail outlets. Good cable.",

      "B0BZ4R7JCZ ★★★★☆ <b>Exactly what I needed!</b> Nice and heafty 3 conductor I got to use in various solar power applications. Its heavy enough for low current (10 amp) AC or DC applications which is what I liked most about it for our off-grin cabin. We have many uses for this and its good stuff, real copper wire with a nice thick jacket on it. It's not romex or anything, but It does the trick for many of the things we do around here. How My Star Rating System Works & What They Mean: 1 STAR - Pretty much junk and I would return and ask for a refund if I could. 2 STAR - It works, but barely meets the minimum requirements it should in order to keep it and not return it, but I would not order again. 3 STAR - It does what it was designed to do, but there's nothing really special about it. It's acceptable but not great. 4 STAR - I am very comfortable recommending it to a friend because it is is well made, durable, and delivers on its advertised features, and I would buy it again. 5 STAR - I really love it. The item exceeds my expectations of quality, durability and functionality. Not only would I purchase it again, but I would also actively encourage friends and family to do the same. All of my reviews are my own personal opinion and are completely honest no matter if I receive an item for free or I pay for it. I am an avid Amazon shopper, as well as an Amazon Vine Voice and I personally rely on reading reviews to make all of my buying decisions, so I understand the importance of honest reviews from my peers.",
      "B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ <b>Excellent hook-up wire for outdoor and automotive projects.</b> This is good wire for low voltage projects around your house, barn, and garage. The outer sheath is very rugged and abrasion resistant and yet it strips easily so that you're not fighting with it, as you'll do with other types of two-conductor and sheathed wires. The two inner conductors will handle a modest amount of amperage such as for wiring up lights and similar electrical devices. Further, the inner conductors take solder well, but I'd advise that you use some flux to ensure that the solder adequately infiltrates between the wire strands.",
      "B0C48K99SM ★★★★★ <b>Good wire, good value.</b> High quality solid copper core 5-wire bundle where each wire measures out perfectly to 18 AWG.

      "B0CSD35PQT ★★★★★ <b>High quality copper wire rated up to 18 amps.</b> This is indeed made out of 100% copper wire. The jacket is thick and durable yet flexible. 14 gauge wire is rated for 15-18 amps up to 50 ft and 10-13 amps over 50ft long. It's important to make sure to select the proper size wire for your application so you do not overheat it and damage it.",
      "B09V56LTY5 ★★★★☆ <b>Good for repairing outdoor marker light cables, robust insulation, pure copper wire - not tinned</b> We have an extensive series of outdoor stairs and boardwalks that are lighted by LED marker lights every ten feet. The lights are powered by a low voltage cable under the walkways. Last Winter a mother fox made a temporary den for her cubs under one of the boardwalks. In the Spring we discovered that several of the marker lights wouldn't light up due to power cables that were chewed through by sharp little teeth. The foxes have moved on but we were faced with repairing the broken cable. That's why I got this cable. It's perfect for low voltage outdoor use. The outside jacket is thick and robust. It took a bit of careful cutting to strip it off without damaging the inside conductor wires. Once off, I noticed this isn't just a standard single channel insulator jacket. It actually has two channels -- one for each of the conductors. (See photo.) That's makes for very tightly insulated conductors that should provide enhanced protection in underground or very wet environments. When I stripped the two conductors, I noticed they are not tinned as stated in the product description. This may or may not be an issue for you. Tinned copper cable is easier to solder and also minimizes corrosion for non-soldered joints. I removed a star from an otherwise five star review due to this. Summary Comments If you don't need tinned copper cable for low voltage outdoor applications, this is a good choice. The insulation is robust and should hold up well in underground or wet environments. You get pure copper conductors that provide efficient electrical conductivity.",
      "B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ <b>Beefy wiring</b> This is some beefy wiring. I added a few more low voltage landscaping lights recently using this wire and it is some of the thickest plastic jacket wiring I've used. I'm sure you could use it for speakers as well",

      "B0BZ4R7JCZ ★★★★★ <b>Works great</b> The build quality of this electrical wire is outstanding. The wire features a solid and heavy-duty jacket that instills a sense of durability and reliability. It can withstand moderate impacts and rough handling without compromising its integrity. This rugged construction ensures that the wire can handle the demands of various electrical applications, making it suitable for both professional and DIY projects. Despite its solid construction, the wire remains surprisingly flexible and soft. It easily bends and maneuvers around corners, allowing for convenient routing and installation. The flexibility of the wire is especially useful when working in tight spaces or when dealing with complex wiring configurations. Its softness adds to the ease of handling and makes it effortless to work with during installations. I primarily utilized this wire as a tool power cable, connecting power tools and equipment to a power source. Throughout my projects, the wire performed flawlessly, delivering a consistent and reliable power supply. I encountered no issues with power transmission or connectivity. The tinned copper construction of the wire ensures excellent conductivity, minimizing any potential voltage drops or interference, resulting in efficient and uninterrupted operation of my tools. Additionally, the 16-gauge thickness of the wire is well-suited for most power applications. It offers ample current-carrying capacity for typical household tools and equipment, providing a safe and stable power supply. The wire's length of 100 feet provides sufficient reach, allowing for flexible placement of tools and work areas without the need for additional extension cords.",

The insulation, around both cables, is very thick should handle most extreme situations. The wires are actually stranded copper wire and not a \"copper clad\" imitation. The size is 16AWG and was tested with a caliper and a wire-cutter. The length was slightly over 32.8FT. Honestly, nothing negative about this listing and would recommend it if the price/size/options meet you needs. Everything came out as expected and would get it again if needed.",
      "B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ <b>Great wire</b> This wire appears to be really good quality. The casing is nice and thick and would be great for connecting to a landscape light low voltage transformer.

      "B092JB7VD2 ★★★★★ <b>High quality, thick tough jacket, flexible for easy connections, pure copper/great conductivity</b> This is high quality two conductor wire. The insulation jacket is thick and tough yet flexible enough to allow for easy connections to your terminals. The conductor is pure stranded copper (see photo) which is much more conductive (efficient) than stranded aluminum found in cheaper wire. I couldn't find anything I don't like about this wire. I highly recommend it."

This is actually thicker than anything I have ever used before on my electric fence installations. This is more than enough to bury under my gates and entrances. The advantage of using this wire is that I can bury it under all driveways and walk through gates and not worry about it being harmed over time. When I open a gate the electric fence can stay energized around the entire property without breaking the connection. Those spring loaded handles you use to break the wire and open a gate often rust out and fail. I will still use these to energize the gate itself but now I know the rest of the property is energized while I come and go.

      "B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★☆ <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again).",

      "B0CV7XP7JN ★★☆☆☆ <b>Decent, but far from great</b> First, before ordering, understand that the wiring is VERY stiff. It sure doesn't make it easy to work it around the normal bends of a car environment. I needed to use this for my AC Epicenter (since it's such a low voltage draw). I didn't need to buy and install a distribution block as I'm running a single 5 channel amp, so I preferred to run from the front for power. After fighting with its stiffness, I gave up and just ordered a MUCH better 3 conductor from Crutchfield. World of a difference. So if you're ok with the ridiculous stiffness routing it through your car, it seems like a decent enough cable for low voltage and current.

Looked at and tried many types and they were never flexible enough to give me the comfort that they wouldn't bind or have the wires break inside. This stuff flexes so well that it can be routed easily and definitely will clean up the wiring, it even maintains it's path and doesn't flop to the side so it won't need anything more than a strand of filament to keep it inline and away from motion parts. I can run all 3 fans, thermistor, and 3 wire LEDs in this one cable with all their individual wires hooked up. If you run even a cheap breakout toolhead and deck pcb with a common ground you can add in the 5 BL probe wires into it and only have your servo cable and heater wires separate in the sleeving, which they should be anyways due to size/current differences. All this in a 6mm or so package. I did tidy wiring before but could never get all the wires to less than 11-12mm and they were always lumpy and didn't flex well binding up my toolhead on certain movements. This will help me get it down to less than 10mm diameter in total. If i upgrade to a board system i'll definitely come back to see if there's a cable with the proper number i need to keep all the low voltage in one.

      "B0C9H1G52F ★★★★★ <b>Works well - Good value</b> All copper products have gotten to noise-bleed pricing of late. Even running low voltage wire is just ridiculously expensive especially if you run to one of the home stores. Ad frankly , if you're ordering wire without knowing what it is or seeing/feeling it, it can be a little scary as the quality varies so much. This wire arrives on a wooden core. Okay - that makes 500ft of heavy a little heavier, but you know they care about their product. It's also probably the only way to ship it so it doesn't end up as a bundle of knotted wire when it arrives in your standard Amazon box which in my case was shipped through UPS and clearly had a tough ride. But 500 feet of wire is pretty heavy at about 22 lbs on a 10x10-ish core. And the wire made it fine with a nice sheet of cardboard wrapped around the wire in between the core ends. The box clearly won over whichever UPS employee was fighting with it. The wire just feels like quality. It''s a firm, yet flexible outer sheath holding the two separate strands of 16 gauge wire. The sheath is UV resistant and rated for direct burial. It's UL listed and RoHS rated. It seems like a quality product and for purposes it's great. My use case is extending an existing low voltage run along the side of the property of the house to the back and introducing low voltage lights to the back yard. In southern Florida, the groundwater is high, the weather humid, and the sun hot. What better test ground for this? Anyhow it's ultimately gonna be buried under landscape rocks yet above landscape fabric in most places. Others will be direct burial In certain spots known for puddling. I expect no issues given the quality of this wire. And at 16Awg I expect it to be able to carry the 12 volts I need without concern. Highly recommend.",

I would not use the wire in a location where it is exposed to the elements but for use inside a PVC conduit or indoors, it works perfectly and should last forever.

Being an electrician with some high-voltage experience, I think the 15KV insulation claim is realistic, Also, I think the 2 thick layers of PE insulation will be quite tough in standing up to abrasion and the elements. My opinion is that the pricing for this 328' roll can't be beat and I recommend the product.",
      "B07Y7S1BRN ★★★★☆ <b>As advertised but hard to split</b> Arrived quickly and seems to be of good quality, thick coating while still plenty of flexibility. Biggest issue I had is in splitting the wires. I used a blade to split down the middle and was tough to separate without having to use a knife the whole way. Because of this I had issues with splicing through coating and exposing the wire a few times. Would be nice if were able to split them easier. Hopefully taping them up tightly and connecting lights at exposed point won't cause durability issues.",

Its lower voltage wire, I would advise against using this for household wire with 120 or 240v. For my needs though this will be on the shelf as the go to replacement wire for automotive 12V usages. You can use it to power low-mid power stereo equipment (probably would go bigger for over 1k watts). Use it to run new circuits on the interior like a few more 12v power points or USB chargers for phones, powering 12V displays or really anything on the interior of the vehicle. You can use it for other automotive needs but I would use a sleeve for anything under the hood or tucked into the undercarriage. Its very flexible so running it under trim should be great and its stiff enough to poke through channels/grommets.",

I did however use shrink wrap connectors and noticed that the insulation has a low melting point, so some melting occurred when applying heat to shrink the tubing, using a heat gun. I would not use a flame or torch as a heat source, but with a heat gun you can get it hot without melting insulation. All in all, well made and perfect for hobbyists.",

This iGreely 10awg 30ft cable is another great product. They have been my go-to for low voltage wire and cables for my solar setup and vehicles. I ran this cable under my gazebo, where I have a little solar setup. I usually go out there and do movie nights on my days off from work. This cable is 30 feet black and 30 feet red. Some brands advertise 30 feet, but later, you find out they meant 15 feet black and 15 feet red. I can confirm that the wire is copper and not just coated. The insulation feels durable. It is thick but still very easy to bend. This is great if you dont have a straight shot where you are running it. I have the cable running from my solar panel on the roof down to my solar controller. I haven't fully cut the cable to size yet because Im thinking of reconfiguring my setup. I may change some things around and wanted to keep some slack. I did cut off a few pieces to make some MC4 cables. This cable has been through storms, the sun, rain, etc... even through the bad weather, it has held up great. I have part of it just lying on the ground and unprotected, but it's holding up very well. I recommend iGreely products and will be purchasing more myself.",

The big box stores had wires but cost considerably more. The wires are nice and flexible making it easy to run along it's path. The individual strands are also thin making it easy to connect to the lights. Nothing worse than thick strands that are difficult to work with and stab you in the finger as you try to wrap together. In my case I used the 12 ga line as the main power line and the 16 ga to the light. Probably didn't need to set it up that way but I have a nice heavy gauge main line if I want to add more lights or accessories.",

      "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>Works great for farm use</b> The RiteFENCE Electric Fence Double Insulated Underground Hard Cable is working perfectly for use 'underneath' my 12' and 16' foot double gates that lead to my pasture. For years I have used a system where I disconnect my electric fence by hand to open my gates without getting shocked. I dug a small trench about 6\" deep under a couple of my gates and buried the RiteFENCE, and left each end protrude out of the ground about two feet to connect to one of the lower existing fence wires so as not to disconnect the continuous circuit at any time when opening gates now. I chose the 6\" depth to bury the heavily insulated RiteFENCE since in addition to moving livestock through the gates, I also drive vehicles and farm implements through the gates as well. The RiteFENCE is very sturdy and rigid, and the 12-½ gauge took some time to straighten out to fit flat and neatly into the trenches I dug and placed the wire into, but this is a definite plus for electric fence wire to be used on a farm or ranch. The RiteFENCE doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and has a thick outer coating with the inner wire apparently coated as well for the 'double insulation' aspect. When installing, I also cut back a couple of inches of the RiteFENCE on each end and used a heavy duty crimp connection to the barb wire fencing I use. Once crimped, I neatly wrapped the connections with quality electrical tape to seal from the elements. The RiteFENCE is going to be ideal for many other underground connection needs I have around the farm. I would highly recommend any farmers and ranchers who run electric fence to give the RiteFENCE a try if you want to eliminate the risk of a nasty shock, especially with the higher powered fence chargers. The price point seems very fair and in fact is actually a little cheaper than what I saw at my local farm supply store. Highly recommend!",

It will solder, just not as well as nicely tinned wire. I would plan on using crimp connectors with this wire as it’s takes too much effort to solder a whole bunch of connections. 4 stars for the difficulty to solder, otherwise it works well for CNC."

      "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Nice design</b> This product has proven to be an excellent choice for my electrical projects, offering several key features that make it stand out from other wires on the market. The use of tinned copper wire is a significant advantage of this silicone wire. The tin layer serves as a protective barrier for the inner oxygen-free copper, preventing it from being oxidized. This feature enhances the wire's longevity and ensures consistent performance over time, even in demanding conditions. The soft silicone insulator on this wire makes it highly flexible, making it easy to handle and maneuver during installations. This flexibility is a real benefit when working in tight spaces or intricate electrical setups, as it allows for smooth routing and minimizes the risk of wire kinking or damage. The availability of six different colors in the spools is a practical and thoughtful feature. It makes it easy to distinguish between wires and simplifies identification in complex wiring configurations. This color-coding system has been invaluable in my projects, enabling me to work more efficiently and avoid any potential wiring errors. With its rating for all under 600V devices and a rated current of 12A, this silicone wire is suitable for a wide range of applications. Whether it's low-voltage electronic projects, DIY circuits, or even some home appliances, this wire can handle the task with ease and reliability.",

This system only produces about 400W at peak power . . . it's primarily for LED lighting, USB charging, etc. Well within the specs of this wire. All runs are also within a meter of any point, so the resistance of the wire is negligible. So far, all of my testing and use of this wire has been positive and I don't anticipate any issues moving forward. This should remain serviceable for a long time. Ultimately, is it worth the price? Yes",

Stiffer in a colder outdoor environment. I did not measure the length to confirm advertised 165 ft though. Conductor appears to be pure copper strands, which is as claimed, not copper coated aluminum. The individual strands are quite fine. I counted 64 strands after stripping.

But you weren't expecting a mainstream brand anyhow, and it's just outdoor low voltage wire. It's fine. Looks like it will hold up in the garden. - One thing to keep in mind is that because it's bare copper wire (not tined, like marine wire) the connections are subject to corrosion from moisture and humidity. Make sure to use a connector method that either bonds the ends (solder) or creates a waterproof barrier to prevent this. - At the time I ordered the 16/2 165ft roll was $41, making it an okay deal, considering it's generic wire. - Hope this helps"

      "B000F5Q2SO ★★★★★ <b>Chainmail</b> Making my own chainmail. So far I’m on pack 4 . I do wish it came with more but understandable price point value for the steel. I did drop some loops when transporting but that was makers error( me)",
      "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>12 1/2 gauge class 3 galvanized steel cable, polyethylene coated. Very tough stuff.</b> I cut through the end of the insulation with my pocket knife to check for two layers. Not easy! I didn't end up going all the way around as I would normally do to strip a wire but was only able to take off a corner and that's all I wanted to try to do. It seemed more like one very thick layer, at least double normal wire insulation thickness, and much tougher. Polyethylene is not a cheap material. I expect to use a cutting wheel even to strip the ends. Inside is a single conductor which they say is galvanized steel, not the usual conductor materials of aluminum or copper. Copper would be way too expensive in this application. I suppose aluminum could crack. This is so thick it's hard for me to bend the cable with my hands. I'll want to bury this and forget it for many years, and I expect to be able to do so.",
      "B000F5Q2SO ★★★★★ <b>Great</b> Doesn’t rust, easy to work with, just the one I needed, will buy more",
      "B001EX57ZK ★★★★☆ <b>Strong, Galvanized, Multipurpose</b> I recently purchased a roll of OOK 50143 Solid Utility Wire for a variety of DIY projects around my home. I’ve been very impressed with its versatility, durability, and ease of use. The wire is made of galvanized steel, which makes it resistant to rust and corrosion. It’s also quite strong and can be used for a wide range of tasks, from bundling cables to hanging plants. I’ve used the wire to secure my garden hose, hang bird feeders, and even create a makeshift trellis for my climbing plants. It’s been up to the task in every situation. The wire is also very easy to use. It’s soft and pliable, so you can easily bend and shape it with your hands. I’ve found that it’s much easier to work with than some of the stiffer utility wires I’ve used in the past. Overall, I’m very pleased with the OOK 50143 Solid Utility Wire. It’s a versatile, durable, and easy-to-use product that’s perfect for a variety of DIY projects. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality utility wire",
      "B0195UGSH4 ★★★★★ <b>Good quality product for a reasonable price</b> Being that it is made of stainless steel, it will work well for its intended purpose and will be very durable for harsh environments.",
      "B001EX57ZK ★★★☆☆ <b>Galvanized</b> It doesn't say so anywhere, but the wire I received is galvanized. If you are going to use it for electrolytic rust removal, you need to remove the zinc, or just buy bare wire. I would not have purchased this had they told me it was galvanized.",
      "B000F5Q2SO ★★★★★ <b>excellent product</b> I have ordered the Hillman 122060 200' 16G GALV Wire before and the product is outstanding.",
      "B000F5Q2SO ★★★★★ <b>Basically galvanized bailing wire - perfect!</b> Met my needs 100% I wanted a weather resistant wire that was strong, yet bendable enough to manipulate by hand for general purpose applications on the farm. Basically galvanized “bailing wire”. This product was perfect. Spot on.",
      "B000H5S0M8 ★★★★★ <b>Galvanized Steel Wire</b> It is exactly what I need for my projects",
      "B07CHS7GGZ ★★★★★ <b>Good product.</b> I use this wire for coil building. It works great for me. I've bought this brand a few times. The wire is always clean with no kinks. I use \"Master wire supply\" stainless 316L and kanthal. I have been very happy with the quality."
