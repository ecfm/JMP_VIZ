I enjoy using it each time I start a new 3D printer build and go to wire up DC supply outputs. The flexibility allows me to route the wires wherever I need. Usually this is between the frame rails of the printer, for running power from the supply to either the controller board or MOSFETS that I use to power my heat bed and hot end. I usually crimp and soldier all my connectors. For me, this wire has never had any troubles wicking up the soldier. So, by doing both I get a solid bond that I never have to worry about.

This stuff flexes so well that it can be routed easily and definitely will clean up the wiring, it even maintains it's path and doesn't flop to the side so it won't need anything more than a strand of filament to keep it inline and away from motion parts. I can run all 3 fans, thermistor, and 3 wire LEDs in this one cable with all their individual wires hooked up. If you run even a cheap breakout toolhead and deck pcb with a common ground you can add in the 5 BL probe wires into it and only have your servo cable and heater wires separate in the sleeving, which they should be anyways due to size/current differences.

The silicone jacket is immune to soldering temperatures with no melting or creep from the heat. The solid copper strands are tinned to prevent oxidation and to ease soldering. Working with high-flexibility and heat-resistant silicone wire is a treat compared to PVC-insulated wire, but the higher cost usually makes me limit its use to special projects where there is a great deal of repetitive flexing or where it is necessary to ensure that no stresses are imposed on the joint, such as when soldering to the pads of a circuit board. I would prefer to use silicone wire for everything otherwise. You can punch holes in the cardboard box and use it as a wire dispenser. At $6 per 50ft spool for 20 gauge wire this seems like a very good value, especially compared to hobby shop prices where you can pay that much for a couple 3ft lengths. Highly recommended."

        "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★☆ <b>Nice assortment of wire for electronics bench work; don't go by current rating provided, though</b> I'm a hobbyist maker who creates and repairs electronics, including microcontroller and IoT projects. Having an assortment of wire on hand helps ensure I'm using the right wire for the job both in function and appearance (color coding). This assortment includes 8 spools of silicone insulated 18AWG wire in different colors, along with heatshrink tubing and wire ties in matching colors which is a nice touch for neater, more professional looking wiring jobs. The spools are included in a box with holes to allow for dispensing, but the spools lay flat in the box -- not on edge like other boxes of dispensable wire I have. This isn't really an issue, just an odd choice and it makes the box a bit wider and flatter compared to a vertical orientation. Also included is a very basic wire stripper, though I don't use it as I have more capable wire strippers at hand. I would tend to challenge the specs/rating sheet included. Generally I wouldn't suggest anywhere near 22A be run through 18AWG wire. More like half that, tops. While the silicone insultation will help reduce the chance of fire from an over current situation compared to PVC or other materials, it will still get very hot and is a grossly inefficient application of power, with so much energy being lost as heat due to the resistance of the wire. Further, seeing the recommendation here could lead the inexperienced to conclude that's a safe current for any similarly sized wire. Otherwise, I'm quite satisfied with this product."

The silicone insulation is not just about the aesthetic; it’s super flexible and durable, standing up to the wear and tear of regular use. Stripping the wires is often a hassle with other kits, but with this one, it’s effortless, saving time and frustration. In terms of performance, these wires have been reliable in all my applications, especially in internal wiring where quality cannot be compromised. Their flexibility allows for easy routing through tight spaces without compromising the integrity of the wire. While there are cheaper options out there, this kit proves that you get what you pay for. It’s a fantastic investment for anyone from hobbyists to professional electricians. If you’re looking for high-quality, flexible, and easy-to-use wires, look no further than this 18-gauge wire kit."

No fault to the seller or product, Amazon had the “order this + this + this” option for the end connectors and clamps, which you’ll also need, but it gives you a wrong size for the end clamps. The 3/4” mounting straps are the right size, but 3/4” ends to secure this 6/3 MC cable to your metal boxes is way to big. I ended up having to make a trip to the hardware store to buy smaller 1/2” end clamps instead of the 3/4” ones Amazon was recommending. I love working with MC cable, but its always a pain trying to determine the correct size anti short bushings, end caps, mounting straps etc to go with it. The sizes are all over the place depending on the gauge and number of wires and none of the sellers actually specify what size additional parts are needed to match up with it. As a side note, its also always confusing how sometimes it’ll state (for example) “6/3 wire” where you’d expect it to be three #6 wires total but in reality there are 4 wires, black, red, white and green. There isn’t always consistency in this, sure would be a lot easier if the standard was to count the actual number of wires, including the ground. This 6/3 MC cable in particular is actually four total 6 AWG wires, black, red, white, green for those that aren’t sure. It’s also rated for up to 55 Amps, which is perfect for wiring in a 50 amp RV, Dryer, or Oven outlet. Even if say your dryer outlet only requires 2 hots and a ground (6/2) with no neutral (old style), go ahead and run this (6/3) wire anyhow and just don’t use the extra wire, you’ll be doing yourself a future proof favor for the day when you replace that old appliance and discover the new one requires all 4 wires. Easier, and cheaper to just not use the extra wire now than trying to add another wire later."

I didn't compare the ohm value of the new wire to the factory wire. I just knew the combined resistance of the parallel grids needed to be between 3.9-4.5 ohms. Stringing the failed grid took some trial and error (first attempt, i broke the wire). I eventually got a method to tighten each \"run\". The overall resistance was right at 4.5 ohms. The wire is tough and reasonably difficult to break. I was pulling the runs with hemostatic clamps and the wire held up. I only broke it when i was attempting to wrap around a screw too aggressively.

        "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Nice design</b> This product has proven to be an excellent choice for my electrical projects, offering several key features that make it stand out from other wires on the market. The use of tinned copper wire is a significant advantage of this silicone wire. The tin layer serves as a protective barrier for the inner oxygen-free copper, preventing it from being oxidized. This feature enhances the wire's longevity and ensures consistent performance over time, even in demanding conditions. The soft silicone insulator on this wire makes it highly flexible, making it easy to handle and maneuver during installations. This flexibility is a real benefit when working in tight spaces or intricate electrical setups, as it allows for smooth routing and minimizes the risk of wire kinking or damage. The availability of six different colors in the spools is a practical and thoughtful feature. It makes it easy to distinguish between wires and simplifies identification in complex wiring configurations. This color-coding system has been invaluable in my projects, enabling me to work more efficiently and avoid any potential wiring errors. With its rating for all under 600V devices and a rated current of 12A, this silicone wire is suitable for a wide range of applications. Whether it's low-voltage electronic projects, DIY circuits, or even some home appliances, this wire can handle the task with ease and reliability."

There was a stress point at the hinge that fatigued the factory wires and caused the ice maker to stop working intermittently. This was a perfect fit. I spliced in 9 pieces of wire into the wiring harness and removed the fatigued section of original wires. The high count stranding should hold up well to this type of fatigue. Having ten colors was great too. Overall very happy with this purchase, and I have some leftover for other applications. Delivery was timely, about 2 days with Amazon Prime."

        "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Nice design</b> This product has proven to be an excellent choice for my electrical projects, offering several key features that make it stand out from other wires on the market. The use of tinned copper wire is a significant advantage of this silicone wire. The tin layer serves as a protective barrier for the inner oxygen-free copper, preventing it from being oxidized. This feature enhances the wire's longevity and ensures consistent performance over time, even in demanding conditions. The soft silicone insulator on this wire makes it highly flexible, making it easy to handle and maneuver during installations. This flexibility is a real benefit when working in tight spaces or intricate electrical setups, as it allows for smooth routing and minimizes the risk of wire kinking or damage. The availability of six different colors in the spools is a practical and thoughtful feature. It makes it easy to distinguish between wires and simplifies identification in complex wiring configurations. This color-coding system has been invaluable in my projects, enabling me to work more efficiently and avoid any potential wiring errors. With its rating for all under 600V devices and a rated current of 12A, this silicone wire is suitable for a wide range of applications. Whether it's low-voltage electronic projects, DIY circuits, or even some home appliances, this wire can handle the task with ease and reliability."

        "B0D2LVRXBC ★★★★★ <b>Just a note</b> Its wire, not much to review, I just wanted to mention a note to other buyers or my future self. No fault to the seller or product, Amazon had the “order this + this + this” option for the end connectors and clamps, which you’ll also need, but it gives you a wrong size for the end clamps. The 3/4” mounting straps are the right size, but 3/4” ends to secure this 6/3 MC cable to your metal boxes is way to big. I ended up having to make a trip to the hardware store to buy smaller 1/2” end clamps instead of the 3/4” ones Amazon was recommending. I love working with MC cable, but its always a pain trying to determine the correct size anti short bushings, end caps, mounting straps etc to go with it. The sizes are all over the place depending on the gauge and number of wires and none of the sellers actually specify what size additional parts are needed to match up with it. As a side note, its also always confusing how sometimes it’ll state (for example) “6/3 wire” where you’d expect it to be three #6 wires total but in reality there are 4 wires, black, red, white and green. There isn’t always consistency in this, sure would be a lot easier if the standard was to count the actual number of wires, including the ground. This 6/3 MC cable in particular is actually four total 6 AWG wires, black, red, white, green for those that aren’t sure. It’s also rated for up to 55 Amps, which is perfect for wiring in a 50 amp RV, Dryer, or Oven outlet. Even if say your dryer outlet only requires 2 hots and a ground (6/2) with no neutral (old style), go ahead and run this (6/3) wire anyhow and just don’t use the extra wire, you’ll be doing yourself a future proof favor for the day when you replace that old appliance and discover the new one requires all 4 wires. Easier, and cheaper to just not use the extra wire now than trying to add another wire later."

        "B0CG1GSW3P ★★★★★ <b>Excellent 10-Gauge Copper Wire</b> The headline on the webpage says 12-gauge, but it’s actually 10-gauge wire. Someone said it was aluminum core, but that is not true. It is TINNED COPPER which gives the color of aluminum unless you look at the cut end of the wire. Then, you can see it is definitely copper core. You could also measure its resistance. It measures 0.031 ohms resistance in 30’. That’s equivalent to 1.033 ohms per 1000’. The standard for resistance of 10-gauge copper wire is 1.018 ohms per 100’ @ 25° C. Aluminum wire (10-gauge) is 1.649 ohms @ 25° C. My reading was at 24° C. Therefore, it’s copper wire. This wire is extremely flexible because of its silicone insulation and the extremely fine wire strands that make up the wire core. That makes it easy to work with and very desirable. Amazon Vine sent this product to me for an honest unbiased review. Would I recommend it? Yes, I’m looking forward to using this wire to run power to my trailer’s winch. It’s high quality and very useful."

What a deal... just perfect to both use and store, sits flat and doesn't take up much room and stacks well. Great start... The outside insulation jacket is a very thick PVC material, it wasn't real easy to cut so it shouldn't nick easily (think of a errant nick from using a wire staple). Even though it's a thick jacket, it's super pliable. The inside wire insulation both cuts and strips more easily than the outside and is easy to work with. I only hesitate saying a joy, because it sounds to corny... There's about a million different uses and projects that this wire would be perfect for, you'll certainly run out of wire before you run out of projects. It is NOT house wiring or electrical supply to anything... it's very small, 22 gauge is tiny.. In a house, it would be doorbell or maybe 'ring' style wiring (or alarm sensors), garage door buttons & sensors, not for lights or outlets, extension cords, etc.. Most people probably realize that - but I'm saying it here, just in case... Save yourself a trip to the local hardware and just keep a roll of this on hand.

In the videos the wire coating smoldered but the wire connector did not burn. I found these to be easy to use and easy to verify I had a good connection. And I had enough room to put the wires back into the traditional electricians coil with ground, neutral, hot, and traveler ordering as well as the much deeper insulated smart plug case. Remember that whereas a wire nut can be removed and retightened when using stranded wire, these connectors much be removed and replaced for stranded wire. If one is using solid wire, then the connect can safely be removed and reused. So plan well when connecting them.

Connecting the wires on the bottom of the “tee” wasn’t as easy. It took a couple of attempts to align the wires and hopefully get both to connect. The use of pliers was also required. Prying the top open required lifting 2 small tabs that can be a bit challenging to get them both to release at the same time.

This is great wire for that purpose that will keep the install clean looking as well as protect the wire very well, much better than loom. It’s very flexible and the gauge appears correct. The wire itself is actually copper that’s tinned and not copper coated aluminum. CCA is much cheaper but is only able to carry 60% or so power than the same size in solid copper. It’s always a concern with wire particularly with lower priced wire. I’ve used this in multiple installs now and I’m quite pleased with its performance and value. It’s good stuff."

The high temp insulation makes it nice for soldering, it doesn't shrink off or split out from the heat of nearby soldering - and the temp range is also low (cold). I didn't test it, but the low end spec is -76F.. (So obviously I'd have something special around to make any claim about testing it anywhere near that.) I'll have to pickup a couple new rolls for my next trip to Antarctica (lol). It's a whole bunch heavier at 10 gauge than I normally use but I have a couple projects that will use up most of, if not all of the rolls. I'm adding fog lights to my car and I'm rewiring a couple speakers. It feels so nice that if I have any left, I may just rig up a new set of test leads for my multi-meter. Also available in smaller gauges, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 & 22, those other sizes are probably more commonly used and more in line with the size I'd usually pickup for small general purpose projects - but the fog lights, can draw a bunch of current, so for a 10 ft run in a car, this can handle >200 watts, or plenty enough for my fog lights.",

If you look at the wire gauge chart you can use 100 watts of lights if it's 40 feet or less. Shorter than 40 feet the carrying capacity goes up more, so this is perfect for me. I ran 12v LED Headlights and tail lights on my golf cart. I ran a 12v actuated valve on this wire. I have plans for landscape lighting but am playing with solar lights at the moment so I may never get there. Funny that the one thing it is really intended for I may never use it for! I'm sure I'll have a stereo install in the future for my son and this can work for speaker wire too. Lots of low voltage uses. The longest run I've done so far was for the 12v actuated valve, about 20', and I used maybe 10' on the golf cart. So I have plenty left over for whatever the next project is."

I decided to try myself and see. However, firing to cone 6 myself, I can attest now that it is NOT a high fire wire! I used it as in a bead rack to fire earrings and it completely melted and my pieces fell to the shelf (thank God for kiln cookies!!) I did the same with the Kemper high temp wire, which funny enough is rated at a lower temperature (1196°C) in the the same firing and it worked flawlessly!! I would say it is my fault for firing pieces on a product I wasn't certain about but I look back now and see this is Amazon and the suppliers fault for 1) Amazon recommending this product as \"Amazon's Choice\" and 2) The manufacturer's false advertising of this material as a \"HIGH TEMP\", \"NICHROME\", AND \"1200C RESISTANCE\" when it in fact is not. I'm assuming it works for lower temps however it is definitely not made to stand to its description of 1200C (AKA cone 6)!! Overall don't waste your time with this product. Just stick to KEMPER. Side Note - I acknowledge that some customers used this product and had no issues. However this is not a good justification for purchasing it as I did.

This wire is less likely to tarnish than standard silver-plated wire-wrap wire. It's just the right size for data-level or small-signal connections to transistors and ICs, which move very little current and cannot overheat #30 wire.

I secured the extra ends of the wire and two kiln shelf columns and fired everything as glaze ware. Pros: +the wire held and the beads fired without the wire breaking or melting. Cons: -after cooling the kiln, the twisted wire was so brittle that it broke upon picking it up and some small pieces got utterly stuck by the glazed, so had to carefully Dremel those areas. -because of this, the wire has become understood to be a one-time use only, so that cost of having the buy more wire eventually adds up over time. Overall, I would purchase again, because it’s handy to have on hand if you need it.",

If you are at all sensitive to the quality of your music reproduction, get this wire. It is VERY good and not very expensive."

Everything went pretty well and I was able to enjoy a movie that night. My plan was to add texture and paint the next day. The very next day I woke up to half of the cable detached from the wall. Total disaster. Re-installing it is a total pain. I contacted support and they told me that the textured wall shouldn't be a problem and to try again. What I did was to redo the installation in the baseboard. The results, after a couple of weeks, has been the same. The cable is starting to detach in some areas and now I'm wondering if I should add a stronger glue (very messy) or change cables (after the big investment on these ones).

        "B09DB9FD5M ★☆☆☆☆ <b>It's 18 gauge electrical cable, but it's unmarked and smells very bad.</b> There is no spec markings on the casing so it can't be used in any application where a home inspection would require it. Mine came as a twisted mess that looks unprofessional and not really useable for anything more than auto speaker wire. Looks like just a haphazard cut from a much larger spool. Biggest complaint is it stinks up whatever room it is in. It is potent and I think the manufacturer knew this because it came double bagged. I thought the busted sauce that was in the Amazon box this came together in was what smelled up the box but several days later it's definitely the wire as I can smell it from 8 feet away. The price isn't bad and the copper wire itself seems ok. But the jacket used isn't useable for any code regulated work and it's only marking is the meter length interval. The jacket is also pretty thin and the inside wiring easy twists and came twisted. I wouldn't recommend it for anything beyond audio or LED work where the load is rather light."

The PVC sheathing on this wire is smooth and I was able to easily pull it through a conduit to replace an old wire with just some electrical tape joining the ends. Tested with a light drawing 2 amps, and only detected a .3V voltage drop across the entire 50 foot coil. Sold as 12V low voltage wire, but rated for 300V. I like that this wire is rated for direct burial and waterproof, so long as it remains undamaged. It's easy enough to slide this through some conduit or at least sections of old garden hose or something to make it more durable and resist chafing. The PVC sleeve is somewhat loose and the individual wires can be removed from short sections fairly easily. Not very flexible, but easy enough to bend. The price point is typical for similar products, but I see a 20% discount is currently offered, making it a good bargain for a good product."

        "B0BYNNJS8B ★★★★★ <b>Good Quality, High Temp Wire</b> I work on a lot of electronics requiring 12-gauge wire and recently procured this wire for a couple of my projects. I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful."

I hope this 18 gauge wire isn’t going to be under-rated for my application as the current wire appears to be pretty thin as well. Finding multi-conductor wire with more than 6 conductors at 16 or 14 gauge at a reasonable price is quite difficult and if I find this wire isn’t the right size I can always use low current relays and contactors as a work-around. If you’re running wire for speakers, PA or intercom system, this wire is perfect for those applications. And from some of the prices I’ve seen lately, this is a steal for 50 ft. of copper."

It looks and feels great to the touch; much better than the cloth covered wire from back in the day. I suspect the reason is that the modern 'cloth' contains some synthetics that weren't available 75 years ago. But this wire fits in fine with genuine vintage items, and this cloth is much more durable than the old stuff. I will be using it to rewire an old vintage lamp to get rid of the vinyl/plastic modern wire. I think it is a good choice to re-wire a valuable antique item as well. This wire is flexible but not as limp as most appliance wire. At first I thought the reason must be solid copper instead of stranded copper inside, which would be very strange. It's stranded not solid, however, and the lack of limpness is because the black-coated and white-coated copper stranded wires inside are embedded in a PVC 'cord' that is completely solid. In other words, there isn't a PVC tubing containing the 2 inner wires but rather a solid mass of PVC. Thus the whole thing is sturdier and heftier than it would be if it were a cloth covering over a PVC tubing containing 2 wires. Well done, as the resulting heft makes this wire seem substantial which adds a beautiful aesthetic to any vintage item. Once my re-wiring job is done if I learn any more I'll come back and edit this review."

Apparently, the builder's electrician used the same wire nuts (red) everywhere, regardless of how many wires were coming in. The problem is, there were several points where 6 wires needed to be joined. The red nuts that were used are not rated for more than 4 12-guage wires. Evidently, the electrician tried to compensate for that by twisting the wires together with pliers or something, but the connection was still flaky, which resulted in some flickering lights and unreliable outlets. These Gardner Bender blue wire nuts fixed the problem completely! I took the old small red wire nuts off in every place where I saw more than 4 wires being joined, then put these on, twisted by hand with a pretty strong force until I was not able to twist anymore, then closed all the boxes and tested with an electrical tester. All the connections were solid - no more flickering lights or unreliable outlets. I definitely recommend blue Gardner Bender wire nuts in every place where 5 to 6 common household wires (12 AWG) need to be joined together. The nuts are quite large, so keep that in mind. Typically I envision them being needed for neutral connections, as all neutrals typically go together while the hots are wired to different switches."

And also saving your hands from unnecessary mangling. The feel might takes a bit of getting used to (positioning your hands around the tool). But it is ultimately pretty intuitive.

One reviewer mentioned that the wires are not actually tinned; that is true. It's not a big deal when you are rewiring a lamp but it probably should be removed from the description. Once I rewired my lamps, I found that I love the vintage look of the wire so I decided to make some \"vintage\" extension cords using repro antique plugs and some new old stock surface mount receptacles. They look really cool, and they don't spoil the vintage look of my room and my lamps. Just remember that this is 18 gauge wire so you don't want it to be carrying more than 15 amps. Overall, I really like this wire and it's a simple way to keep that vintage look without having to use dangerous old wire. It's a great value and it does the job admirably."

Apparently, the builder's electrician used the same wire nuts (red) everywhere, regardless of how many wires were coming in. The problem is, there were several points where 6 wires needed to be joined. The red nuts that were used are not rated for more than 4 12-guage wires. Evidently, the electrician tried to compensate for that by twisting the wires together with pliers or something, but the connection was still flaky, which resulted in some flickering lights and unreliable outlets. These Gardner Bender blue wire nuts fixed the problem completely! I took the old small red wire nuts off in every place where I saw more than 4 wires being joined, then put these on, twisted by hand with a pretty strong force until I was not able to twist anymore, then closed all the boxes and tested with an electrical tester. All the connections were solid - no more flickering lights or unreliable outlets. I definitely recommend blue Gardner Bender wire nuts in every place where 5 to 6 common household wires (12 AWG) need to be joined together. The nuts are quite large, so keep that in mind. Typically I envision them being needed for neutral connections, as all neutrals typically go together while the hots are wired to different switches."

I got out some Southwire Romex and compared the two. This Arizona branded wire was nearly identical. The outer jacket was cut and pulled back and the wire stripped just as easily as the Romex. The only difference I really noticed was the outer jacket of the Romex felt more slick or slippery to the Arizona wire. It might matter a little bit if you are trying to pull it through 10 studs at once or so, but I don't think it would be a big difference. Overall, this wire seems to be right in line with the Romex. At the moment, this 100 ft roll is cheaper by about $20 than the 100 ft of Romex. I will say if you can bump up to the 250 ft roll, that is usually the best deal, but sometimes that is just overkill for your project and a smaller roll works out better. I would certainly have no issues using this wire for adding some lights or outlets and might use it to wire up my shed soon.",

I’m not about to go and unravel this whole thing just to measure if they gave 50ft but based on what I am seeing, that appears to be the case. I like this wire, I know it will be useful in the future. I plan to use it to wire some outdoor lights in the sun room at my park model when it opens up again for the season. Upon inspection of the wire it appears brand new and there are no signs of damage anywhere on the wire. I’m not sure why this wire is tinned because generally you would utilize screw on caps in order to secure the junction between two wires in a home rough in environment.

        "B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★☆ <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again)."

Unfortunately, my house is full of poor wiring, so I have been working on getting everything up to par before I need to use my generator for an emergency. The wire comes in a plastic-wrapped roll with a couple bands around it. I'm used to Romex coming in the plastic roll that you can pull out of the middle, but this wasn't as easy as that. The wire is pliable, as I would expect 14 gauge wire to be, and it stripped well. I had to pull a number of lengths through flexible conduit and it was just stiff enough to push through without a fish tape if the conduit was straight. Overall, I give this wire high marks. I did not encounter any of it that had poor craftmanship, it works great for 15A circuits, and I haven't had an issue after using about 150 feet of it. I will order more and keep it on hand.",

This wire should only be used for a table lamp, from the lamp to the wall plug. The other concerning feature is 18ga copper. The copper stains are too thin to work-with, they are brittle to bend around a connection screw. Soldering is required to support the stains. Why the industry has gone to such small gauge 18ga ( setting aside the min amps & volts ) is because they have never rewire an appliance. 16ga should be the workable appliance size wire."

        "B07ZBLZHN2 ★★★★★ <b>quite nice 4AWG copper cable, for solar projects</b> Reviewing: Spartan Power Bulk Battery Cable Made in The USA UL Listed 100% Pure Cooper Wire A nice roll of quality 4AWG copper wire, seems quite high quality. I putter around with offgrid solar power and battery setups, have several at home in addition to my grid-tied system and like to help friends set their own systems up as well. For that you really need some good heavy high-quality copper wire, because once you get the system down to 12 or 24v, you need to pull quite a few amps to power reasonable-sized inverters, and that means thick copper, and sometimes multiple strands of it. I create my own power cables using copper crimping ends, sometims with two parallel 4AWG lenghs used in parallel as a single cable, and kept as short as feasible. This cable works well for that. It’s reasonably flexible and seems to take the power just fine. I consider copper to be a precious metal; won’t be all that long until it costs a lot more than it does now, because the ore grades are falling inexorably around the world, it’s getting more energetically remote. So I think of owning spare high-quality copper wires as an investment for the future just like gold or silver, only a lot more useful and a lot cheaper. This is a good example of very useful copper cable, recommended to those setting up solar panels and inverters."

It's pretty beefy and at 1A has less than 1V drop over the entire 100 feet. I had no problem stripping the wire and the copper is clean underneath. The roll didn't come with the inner end sticking out so I unrolled it all, drilled a larger hole so it would fit, then re-wrappped (poorly). The inner end could be connected to a power source to allow re-using the roll for temporary tasks needing power at a distance. I measured 3.4mm dia. insulation, 1.4mm dia. wire. Resistance over the whole roll (100 ft. x both directions) was 0.864 ohms, which works out to 4.32 ohms per 1000 ft (verified with LCR meter and running 2A current through it). Matches expected for 16-gauge copper stranded wire. I had to unroll all the wire to get at the other end as they don't poke it through the hole on the side of the spool."

It's pretty soft and pliable which I like because it makes the connectors much easier to install into the wire.The package says \"sunlight resistant\", not sure if that is different than UV resistant, but I bury/cover all of my wire so I'm not worried about that. Another note, it has a max of 300W on the line so do your math but with LED lighting now, good luck using that much per 100 feet!

About 30 feet is buried directly underground from the corner of my house over to the rock wall. The wire is tucked behind and around the large rocks 10 feet up the wall. The casing of the wire is very durable. I must say that I was not at all delicate or gentle while handling it. I made a line in the soil with a garden edging tool down about two inches and used the same tool to shove the wire in the ground. I had no issue with the casing cracking or the wire breaking. I chose the 12 gauge wire to reduce the voltage drop over the long run. I am currently only using 100 watts of lighting but plan to increase it in the future. I liked this product very much. There are a lot of manufacturers of this type of product out there and I have had a few that did not hold up to the Northeast weather. I think that this cable will last quite a long time. I think the price point of this product is average. Over all I think this is a good product at a reasonable price."

If you look at the wire gauge chart you can use 100 watts of lights if it's 40 feet or less. Shorter than 40 feet the carrying capacity goes up more, so this is perfect for me. I ran 12v LED Headlights and tail lights on my golf cart. I ran a 12v actuated valve on this wire. I have plans for landscape lighting but am playing with solar lights at the moment so I may never get there. Funny that the one thing it is really intended for I may never use it for! I'm sure I'll have a stereo install in the future for my son and this can work for speaker wire too. Lots of low voltage uses. The longest run I've done so far was for the 12v actuated valve, about 20', and I used maybe 10' on the golf cart. So I have plenty left over for whatever the next project is."

        "B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★☆ <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again)."

The people who built my house put GFICI outlets on the back of the house around the pool area and time, and the second owners, have taken their toll on them. For whatever reason, so were taken out by ripping the plastic conduit off the boxes and the wires just cut off. How it ever passed home inspection is beyond me, but being the electrician that I am, I have been working on replacing them. Since I was already in the process, I decided to use this wire since it should cover the code requirements for the outlets. I pulled out the old wire from the subpanel (with the power off, off course). Being in Florida, the old wire was about 50 years old and crusty with the humidity and having had various creatures in there over the years. This wire was fully pliable at 14 gauge, and I had no issues pulling in through the bungs and watertight fittings I had added. I'm a fan of flexible conduit and 14 gauge is much easier to pull through it than 12, but make sure you know your local code requirements (or have a licensed electrician do the work) if you are doing this. I have wired three outlets with this wire and haven't found any issues with it. I found it to be easily workable, strips like I would expect it to, and didn't find any flaws in it. I can't see any fault with recommending this wire for your 14/2 wiring jobs."

No fault to the seller or product, Amazon had the “order this + this + this” option for the end connectors and clamps, which you’ll also need, but it gives you a wrong size for the end clamps. The 3/4” mounting straps are the right size, but 3/4” ends to secure this 6/3 MC cable to your metal boxes is way to big. I ended up having to make a trip to the hardware store to buy smaller 1/2” end clamps instead of the 3/4” ones Amazon was recommending. I love working with MC cable, but its always a pain trying to determine the correct size anti short bushings, end caps, mounting straps etc to go with it. The sizes are all over the place depending on the gauge and number of wires and none of the sellers actually specify what size additional parts are needed to match up with it. As a side note, its also always confusing how sometimes it’ll state (for example) “6/3 wire” where you’d expect it to be three #6 wires total but in reality there are 4 wires, black, red, white and green. There isn’t always consistency in this, sure would be a lot easier if the standard was to count the actual number of wires, including the ground. This 6/3 MC cable in particular is actually four total 6 AWG wires, black, red, white, green for those that aren’t sure. It’s also rated for up to 55 Amps, which is perfect for wiring in a 50 amp RV, Dryer, or Oven outlet. Even if say your dryer outlet only requires 2 hots and a ground (6/2) with no neutral (old style), go ahead and run this (6/3) wire anyhow and just don’t use the extra wire, you’ll be doing yourself a future proof favor for the day when you replace that old appliance and discover the new one requires all 4 wires. Easier, and cheaper to just not use the extra wire now than trying to add another wire later.",

My only issue isn't the cable itself but the two other items under the \"frequently bought together\" heading. One of those items is a 3/4\" squeeze connector. That connector does NOT fit this cable (ask me how I know). You need 1/2\" hardware not 3/4\" for this cable. It seems like a massive 6/3 + ground cable like this would want 3/4\" hardware but that's not the case. I bought 1/2\" squeeze connectors and right angle connectors at Home Depot and they did fit. The other item under \"frequently bought together\", the cable strap, is probably the wrong size as well but I didn't buy that item so I don't know for sure.

        "B0C5BLQ327 ★★★★★ <b>Nice length for small project.</b> 25ft is not much, so if you are doing a small job it is great. 12guage is perfect as well for 20 amp breakers, and more than needed for 15 amps. This is a standard Romex style wire with vinyl outer sleeve and insulated individual wires, (white, black, and uninsulated ground.) I do wonder why we do not insulate our ground wires, but that is the standard here and I haven't seen any issues to date with that. Honestly, ground and neutral seem to be ok on the same ground blocks unless you feed into a sub panel where neutral and ground have to be on separate bus bars. Moving on from the lesson, I can say this is a good 12/2 romex that I can recommend that is also decently priced. Locally 15ft of 12/2 romex costs 28 dollars and 40 dollars for 25ft just to give some context on how good this is as a deal."

I've installed many outlets and switches with wire nuts and wanted to give these a try. These much are easier to stow in the box and they save your hands from the repeated twisting. The holding power is great. It is very difficult to pull the wire out once you have it in. In my mind, there is no way a wire is simply going to pop out. Even so, I did run some tape around the wires and the base of the connector just to be sure, but I felt silly doing it. This is a great product that saved me a lot of time and hand strain. I had 12 switches, 18 half-switched outlets and 12 recessed lights to wire. I had zero issues with any wire popping out or the housing cracking. They are very easy to use and strong."

Unfortunately, my house is full of poor wiring, so I have been working on getting everything up to par before I need to use my generator for an emergency. The wire comes in a plastic-wrapped roll with a couple bands around it. I'm used to Romex coming in the plastic roll that you can pull out of the middle, but this wasn't as easy as that. The wire is pliable, as I would expect 14 gauge wire to be, and it stripped well. I had to pull a number of lengths through flexible conduit and it was just stiff enough to push through without a fish tape if the conduit was straight. Overall, I give this wire high marks. I did not encounter any of it that had poor craftmanship, it works great for 15A circuits, and I haven't had an issue after using about 150 feet of it. I will order more and keep it on hand.",

        "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ <b>Appears to be true 16ga wire (unlike some others)</b> I've bought other similar spools of multi-conductor cable, and I've learned that you have to be careful about what you're getting. In one case, I ordered a 50' spool of 18 gauge wire that turned out to be a good 20% smaller, giving 20% higher resistance. So -- the first thing I wanted to check on this wire was the resistance of a single conductor through the length of the whole spool. Granted, I haven't unwound it to measure its length, so I'm taking that part at face value. The principle here is that any copper wire of a certain cross-sectional area (i.e. gauge) will have a given resistance per foot. There are many free online wire resistance calculators that will tell you just what the total resistance should be, when you provide it with the length and wire gauge. In this case, 50' of 16ga wire should be 0.201 ohms. As you can see in the photo, that's exactly what I have, within the precision of the meter I was using. It was actually flipping occasionally between 0.19 - 0.21 but typically sat on 0.20 ohms, which is pretty firm confirmation that this is, in fact, 16ga wire. Having confirmed that fact, I'm happy to recommend this cable for all intended purposes. The individual wires are easy to strip, have thick insulation, and the black outer sheath is sturdy and slick. Within each 16ga wire, the individual strands are pre-tinned, which gives much better corrosion resistance for when you're working in a wet, or otherwise corrosive, environment (like on a boat's wiring or other marine environment). Nice product, exactly as claimed."

Regardless of the type of add-a-tap or gilbert style plug you're attempting to install on these things, the diameter of the cord is really important. If it's too big, your taps and plugs simply won't fit. SPT-1 cord is supposed to have a much thinner insulation that SPT-2. I specifically chose this cord because it is listed as being SPT-1. Well...I nearly broke my thumbs trying to jam this into the Gilbert plug I bought.

The flexibility of the wire is especially useful when working in tight spaces or when dealing with complex wiring configurations. Its softness adds to the ease of handling and makes it effortless to work with during installations. I primarily utilized this wire as a tool power cable, connecting power tools and equipment to a power source.

One reviewer mentioned that the wires are not actually tinned; that is true. It's not a big deal when you are rewiring a lamp but it probably should be removed from the description. Once I rewired my lamps, I found that I love the vintage look of the wire so I decided to make some \"vintage\" extension cords using repro antique plugs and some new old stock surface mount receptacles. They look really cool, and they don't spoil the vintage look of my room and my lamps. Just remember that this is 18 gauge wire so you don't want it to be carrying more than 15 amps. Overall, I really like this wire and it's a simple way to keep that vintage look without having to use dangerous old wire. It's a great value and it does the job admirably.",

The white jacket gives it a clean look, and the fact that it's designed for direct burial in the ground made it easy for me to run the wire without having to worry about any additional protection. The wire itself felt solid and well-made, with red and black conductors clearly marked for easy installation. I used it as an extension cord cable to connect my speakers to my amplifier, and it worked flawlessly. The sound quality was great, and I didn't experience any distortion or signal loss at all."

I putter around with offgrid solar power and battery setups, have several at home in addition to my grid-tied system and like to help friends set their own systems up as well. For that you really need some good heavy high-quality copper wire, because once you get the system down to 12 or 24v, you need to pull quite a few amps to power reasonable-sized inverters, and that means thick copper, and sometimes multiple strands of it. I create my own power cables using copper crimping ends, sometims with two parallel 4AWG lenghs used in parallel as a single cable, and kept as short as feasible. This cable works well for that. It’s reasonably flexible and seems to take the power just fine. I consider copper to be a precious metal; won’t be all that long until it costs a lot more than it does now, because the ore grades are falling inexorably around the world, it’s getting more energetically remote. So I think of owning spare high-quality copper wires as an investment for the future just like gold or silver, only a lot more useful and a lot cheaper. This is a good example of very useful copper cable, recommended to those setting up solar panels and inverters."

These wires are flexible, which work well in cramped projects. I mainly do LED projects so I went with the 18 AWG kit.

I wiped the wall with a damp microfiber to remove any dust and let it dry. I then applied the Ghost Wire starting at one end, peeling about a foot of the backing off at a time, smoothing it and rubbing it to the wall. Working the wrinkles out as I went along. Within one day, both ends of the run had about 6 inches peeling off the wall. Three days later, and both ends are now peeled off about 2 feet. Every morning I've tried to rub it back to the wall. My walls do have a very slight orange peel texture. Perhaps on a smooth finish the Ghost Wire would adhere better. I have not attempted to paint over it yet (and likely won't since it doesn't stay on). The total length of my application was 11.5 feet. Beyond the issue of it not remaining adhered, there were a couple other issues as well. First, there's about 1/8 of clear adhesive which is not covered by the white surface material running down the entire length of the roll. This is very visible (and sticky feeling). I was hoping that I could spray some wall texture over it since paint will likely not cover it correctly. I also snapped off my exposed ends when attaching the end connectors. Since the copper is very thin, any etching done with a razor blade to cleanly expose the copper strips weakens it to the point that any flex will shear it off. I had to peel back and use scissors, leaving a small flap rather than a nice clean transition. My Ghost Wire also was quite wrinkled from being rolled up. The manufacturer states that it's a known issue and recommends a heatgun/hairdryer to remedy so I expected that going in I liked the idea of this product. If it would have stayed on the wall, it would have been great. Even with the problems I had, I could see this working well if run under a carpet. I'm contemplating using a router to notch a shallow channel in the drywall and then just mud over the inserted wire. [update] A week later, and it's completely peeled off. Not an inch is left stuck to the wall. It's just hanging between the two connector blocks that are screwed in."

        "B079NXCN6B ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Terrible adhesion renders the product useless</b> I bought 2 rolls of this cable, one with 2 conductors and another one with 4 conductors to wire my surround speakers. The cable is VERY finicky. You are supposed to flatten the cable, terminate it with the terminals (extra), test the cables before gluing them and clean the wall very well. So I spend about 3 hours doing all the prepping, and then installing it, with a hairdryer and a plastic card to flatten the cable as I went. Everything went pretty well and I was able to enjoy a movie that night. My plan was to add texture and paint the next day. The very next day I woke up to half of the cable detached from the wall. Total disaster. Re-installing it is a total pain. I contacted support and they told me that the textured wall shouldn't be a problem and to try again. What I did was to redo the installation in the baseboard. The results, after a couple of weeks, has been the same. The cable is starting to detach in some areas and now I'm wondering if I should add a stronger glue (very messy) or change cables (after the big investment on these ones). The idea is great, but in order to install this, be prepared to need to use additional glue and refinish the cables to add adhesion, otherwise this is not going to work."

        "B07DY7PT24 ★★★☆☆ <b>buy from home depot instead</b> Just realized it was CCA copper clad aluminum and not solid copper wire. lol. I wired my house, exterior and interior, a couple of years ago with this cable. We've been through two winters in the PNW with a couple weeks of snow each time and it has worked great. But now that I know it's CCA, looking back I would have opted for solid copper. I will be wiring another house but will be buying solid copper CAT5e from Home Depot instead because it's for someone else and I'd like to minimize any issues that might arise in the future. Home Depot has both indoor and outdoor bulk CAT5e cable. It's not as expensive as I thought it was going to be at Home Depot. I'm willing to pay a little extra for some peace of mind. Now I'm interested in running LAN speedtests to see what kind of speeds we're actually getting at home. If you end up buying this cable anyways, and specially if installing cable for someone else, I would highly recommend getting a decent cable tester like the ELEGIANT RJ11 RJ45 Cable Tester B01HCQSHNG. I would not recommend this cable for people who use their internet to work from home because it can turn into a troubleshooting nightmare if your internet connection starts dropping occasionally / sporadically. I would only recommend this cable for temporary solutions or people who have spare time to troubleshoot their network if an issue arises and have no problem re-terminating or re-running a wire. p.s. I've loved using 4.5mm saddle brackets B01NBLP9RU + exterior screws + zip ties to tie down cables, specially if running outdoors or more than one cable along the same path. sturdiest setup I've come across."

I’m out about $150. Rest of Amazon review. The insulators stripped, we’re to big and slide down poles, broke easily. Just over all junk and poor customer service from company FS. Fence Shock recommended my whole purchase before I checked out on Amazon now the blame is pasted off so they are not responsible. Wow just wow. Never again will I purchase from Fence Shock. Amazon review part 2. I’m warning others. These poles are thin and do not stand up straight no matter what you do. On top of that the company recommended the wrong insulators which were cheap plastic that easily broke And DID Not Fit Diameter of poles they recommended. The tightest setting did not fit, they slide down the poles. No resolution. I did my part as a female I contacted FS to make sure I was buying good sturdy poles with the recommended (By FS) insulators. After many weeks now FS does not care. Don’t waste time with FS. Money lost but will never lose anymore because fool me once you can’t fool me twice. Trashed this junk insulators, have no idea what to do with these poles, guess I’ll trash them. No one wants their fence to look wonky with poles lending sideways, foreard, backwards etc. I guess if you cement them in it might be ok. But where I needed them and what I need them for that was not an option. Over $100 plus might as well have thrown that money away cause I do not have any working products.

The local deer decided to go through the fence in a couple spots, sagging the wire as a result. So, we gave Jake's Wire Tighteners a try instead of loosening a lot of staples and stretching the wire to the corners. Worked like a charm! I also bought the special tool. Slipped the tightener on the wire, inserted the tool, a couple of \"cranks\" and, Voila, fence wire was nice and snug again! Keeping a small supply on hand in case the deer critique the fence again."

Our most recent use - as the “form over your nose” and shape to your cheeks piece inside home sewn fabric masks.

I just clipped it to the right length, then used needle-nosed pliers to pull the wire out just slightly to snip it off, then used a nail to push it back inside the rubber so the wire was just slightly shorter than the rubber coating. This keeps it from poking through the material. It washes perfectly and was easy to sew in place. It molds very easily to the shape you need and doesn't feel flimsy. I had a lot left over so I used it in the garden to shore up some plants as well. So overall a great product at a good price.",

To put this in perspective, I go through probably 100 ft. of automotive primary wire in any given week. I do a LOT of small electrical jobs for friends and family, everything from fixing headlights and wiring harnesses, to adding completely new circuits like heated seats or sound systems. I have 0 sound degradation when I use them for speaker wire. If you use it for that, something I've learned by a lot of real world trial and error, that may help someone else out there, is to run the speaker wires down the opposite side of the car you run the power wires; I don't know why it helps, someone who's smarter than I could tell you..maybe it helps cut out interference or something, but tbh I have no idea at all and am not educated enough on that to tell you the why, I just know that it really works. It's almost like some kind of weird, ancient, wiring feng-shui that yields better performance based on geographical location. Supernatural, ancient, far-east, geo-kinestethic techniques and practices aside, it really just helps get the desired result of clear, non-fuzzy sound... ...Ok! anyways, the crazy flexibility and high-strand count of the conductor inside the insulation makes it stupid dumb easy to push em through tight fitting holes without the need to alter the existing structure of something. They're surprisingly elastic, as well, which helps not tear off end bits of wire if you're like me and use an automatic wire stripper... and insist on having the tension permanently set to \"kill\" 😃. The elasticity of the insulation, which is made of/made with with silicone, also means if it gets caught while you run it, you step on it or slam it in something while pulling the wire, that won't (in my experience) compromise the conductor inside. I know that I SHOULD just replace that section of wire, even if it doesn't appear to be damaged, which I do when time and materials allow... and I know I SHOULD stop eating so much red meat, I know I SHOULD stop smoking, I know I SHOULD finally fix that back door screen that bangs every time the wind blows any faster than is required to move a stupid American Beauty grocery bag... my point is that I SHOULD do a lot of things, but don't always get to. in the real world sometimes you just aren't able to do things by the book, for whatever reason, and this wire hasn't let me down when those situations arise. I'll leave you with my answer to the question \"is this **** good enough to be the only wire ill use for automotive and small electronic applications moving forward?\"... ...\"bet\".

I kept all 4 wires, 2 for each channel in the main jacket until I got to the top of my cabinet where I mounted the speakers. Then I pulled out two wires for one channel. From there I continued to pull the complete jacket with the other two wire to the other speaker. I connected banana plugs to the ends that go into my receiver. Basically, just strip, push the cable through and then screw the tips on. These are Amazon Basics Speaker Connector Banana Plugs,12 Count (1 Pack of 6 Pairs), 0.54 x 0.54 x 1.62 inches. I have used these many times on installations. This wire was easy to use with these plugs. The wire work fine. Sound is great. Installation was easy. What can I say? It is wire; the way it should be. I would expect that if I needed to do soldering on these it would be a breeze because they are tinned copper. I recommend this wire."

        "B0CWNBZ164 ★★★★★ <b>3 x 22G Insulated Wire</b> This is just basic 3-wire 22 gauge wire (red-black-yellow), most probably used for, say, low-voltage 24V applications like thermostat wire, or maybe speaker wire (although it's also not shielded, so that might result in some noise?) In my case, I just wanted some hobbyist DIY low voltage wiring to run between some of the 5V USB connectors I've been messing with in kits, etc. Might also use it for some other instances around the house and work bench. And even though it's rated for 300V, I'm not likely to use it for anything 120V or high amperage 12V use. 22G just seems a bit small for that. Good wire, tho, for lots of applications!"

        "B0CMTTT3PR ★★★☆☆ <b>There are no ratings, UL or otherwise, on this cable</b> Ok, so I guess it really depends on what you are doing as to how happy you are going to be with this cable. If you are doing nothing more than running speaker wire, then good for you. You should be happy with the cable. If you are running power wire for an appliance, a solar system, or for any standard project other than low voltage battery, you will have to pause and wonder. What is the voltage rating? What is the current rating? Is this really OFC or something else? You can think it is something, but you will NOT know for sure. If you have an inspector ask for the ratings, you are out of luck and will have to rewire your project. The company says that it is 10 GA Oxygen free copper and they say the rating on the insulation is 200V. So, the problems start when you look at Silicon insulation and find that the normal low voltage rating is 600V up to 35,000V. 200V does not appear in any standard. Most oxygen free tinned copper still looks like copper when you cut it. This cable does not do that, even with a magnifying glass. So, how do you know? Nothing on the cable indicates that it is OFC or anything other than 10GA. Ok, once you get that resolved in your mind, this cable is designed like lamp zip cord except it splits way too easily. Great concept, but you will need to secure the cable ends somehow if you do not want it pulling apart. You can use electrical tape, shrink tubing, or even a tie wrap not pulled too tight. The cable itself is very flexible, like you would expect from a silicon wire. For use in a solar system where there is NO ground and you are required to install a breaker on both the negative and the positive side of the supply, this type of cable works very well. In fact, it is the project I started using it on until the Building inspector asked to see the data sheet on the wire or at least the UL number. Since I could not produce it, I had to remove what I had done and switch to a UL rated cable. Does that make this a bad product? No, it only makes it a quesitonable product since you do not know exactly what you have. I have not been able to find a way to directly contact the company to ask for a spec sheet. I just hope they watch the reviews and can provide the requested item, then this would be a product I would recommend. Until then, I cannot recommend it.",

The high temp insulation makes it nice for soldering, it doesn't shrink off or split out from the heat of nearby soldering - and the temp range is also low (cold). I didn't test it, but the low end spec is -76F.. (So obviously I'd have something special around to make any claim about testing it anywhere near that.) I'll have to pickup a couple new rolls for my next trip to Antarctica (lol). It's a whole bunch heavier at 10 gauge than I normally use but I have a couple projects that will use up most of, if not all of the rolls.

Also available in smaller gauges, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 & 22, those other sizes are probably more commonly used and more in line with the size I'd usually pickup for small general purpose projects - but the fog lights, can draw a bunch of current, so for a 10 ft run in a car, this can handle >200 watts, or plenty enough for my fog lights.",

I tried to butt it against corners, door frames, and base board to minimize its visibility.

Wire comes on a spool and are paired with black and white insulation cover. Wire is is to strip and separate to reach the solder points or the clamps for attachment.

        "B07TFF9FTM ★★★★★ <b>Ultra flexible wire, 200C, great value!</b> Very happy with this wire set -- great value, and it's what the listing says it is. Be sure you know what you're buying. This is ultra flexible, with many super-fine strands and silicone rubber insulation marked 200C (higher than PVC but lower than PTFE). The fine strands (150 of them, but I didn't count!) can be a bit of a challenge when crimping contacts... make sure no microscopic strands escape the crimp -- then it works great. The insulation is thick but soft: very easy to work with but also easily damaged if used in the wrong application. It's the right cable for routing in tight locations, since it's so willing to bend and lay flat... good for DIY drones (flexing arms or retracting legs) or making wiring harnesses that need to flex but are well protected from abrasion and pinching. For more rugged high-temp insulation, consider PTFE but it is much more difficult to work with and hard to find at a reasonable price. As noted by others, some colors are a bit off. Red is clearly orange, and blue is gray-purple. That's okay for my purposes, but maybe not if you are building to a print for assemblies that will be inspected. The velcro wraps keep each spool neat, and the box is good for organizing these spools when lots of other wire spools are around."

This wire reasonably met expectations set in the products description. In general I found it easy to work with, and versatile. It cuts easily with wire cutters, while not being hard to strip with strippers, and it takes soldering as well as crimp fitting well. Pros: + Professional looking spool and wire. + The insulation feels adequate, and good quality. + The wire solders well. + works well with both soldered, and also with crimped connectors. Con: - None so far, I will update if anything comes up. All together: I feel this speaker / hook-up wire as decent value for money, works and performs exactly as expected and is both useful, and versatile for many projects.

        "B0C5MGQNKS ★★★★★ <b>Used as Speaker wire</b> I am using this as speaker wire for my \"Presence\" speakers in my 7.1 surround sound system. It was easy to open the outer jacket and separate the individual wires. I just used a utility knife. I did not have to apply much pressure, therefore making it easier to avoid cutting the insulation on the individual cables. I have an old wire stripper from the early seventies that came from Radio Shack. I just put the cables in and squeeze and get perfectly stripped ends. I have used these strippers on some cables that this is not so easily done. Attached are pictures of the strippers and pictures of the wire at various stages. In one of them you can see where I stripped the middle of the cable insulation. I kept all 4 wires, 2 for each channel in the main jacket until I got to the top of my cabinet where I mounted the speakers. Then I pulled out two wires for one channel. From there I continued to pull the complete jacket with the other two wire to the other speaker. I connected banana plugs to the ends that go into my receiver. Basically, just strip, push the cable through and then screw the tips on. These are Amazon Basics Speaker Connector Banana Plugs,12 Count (1 Pack of 6 Pairs), 0.54 x 0.54 x 1.62 inches. I have used these many times on installations. This wire was easy to use with these plugs. The wire work fine. Sound is great. Installation was easy. What can I say? It is wire; the way it should be. I would expect that if I needed to do soldering on these it would be a breeze because they are tinned copper. I recommend this wire."

That was my plan from the start so it worked out very well for me. the wile soldiers way better than any other wire by far. When you need to splice 2 of them try slightly spreading the wires apart then push the 2 wires together lightly twisting back and forth and they will merge well then squeeze the wires down. it really help to wrap a wire around them after to keep the profile thinner. I have even used the thin soldier to wrap around it so it disappears but thin copper wire does really work well. without anything wrapped around the wires it has decent strength already before it is even soldiered. What I love the most is how they wont pull on my 12v switches like the other wires did. even the led light bars need heavy gauge wire and that heavy wire is tough on the switches so I run a 2 ft. pigtail of silicone wire to the switches and stuff. I will be wrapping up a project up fairly soon and will post a great picture showing tons of these silicone wires."

The PVC insulation is tough and will stand up to abrasion. This cable should not be used for line voltage applications as the insulation is not rated for that application. I use 14/2 cable in my landscape lighting for the final connections to groups of LED fixtures. I use 12/2 for distribution over long distances to get to the clusters of fixtures. 14/2 works great in that application and helps to save a little money compared to running 12/2 everywhere. If your cable runs are all short and you have a modest number of LED fixtures then 14/2 may be good enough for the entire system. Note that 14/2 cable has a lower current rating than 12/2 cable, which is counterintuitive given the numbers are getting smaller as ampacity increases. So if you've got really long cable runs you'll probably want to use the 12/2 instead."

        "B08PKLKTR4 ★★★★★ <b>This is a product designed for professional installation</b> I am an air-conditioning contractor, and have used products like this for the past 15 years. Even veteran contractors often do not know this product exists and it is a lifesaver. Due to the increase in use of Wi-Fi thermostats, which require a common, more people are using similar products. This is because Wi-Fi thermostats require a common . If a common ids required, you must have a minimum of five wires and many homes were wired with four wires if they had single stage heat abd mercury thermostats. This is a common issue with older hones. Another issue is that Low-voltage wiring is very fine and it is hard copper, not stranded. So, age can allow for deterioration and breakage causing problems. Since thermostat wires can be very difficult to pull, depending on if the wire is nailed inside the trusses, inside the walls, in a multi level home or condo, this product can also provide a replacement for a broken wire for a standard stat. This inexpensive product allows us to forgo running a new thermostat wire, at several hundred dollars expense to the customer. We can provide a replacement wire for a daily wine when pulling a new wire is difficult or cost prohibitive, or provide the common needed when needed for a wifi stat when only 4 wires exist. However, it is really designed for a professional to use not for the homeowner. It seems easy enough but truthfully a homeowner risks shorting tge unit or injuring themselves if they don't have the knowledge BBC a s it gets wired inside the air handler/furnace, as well as at the thermostat.",

We have a subpanel outside for our pool equipment, so it was easy to trench from that panel over to our firepit. I added 3 couple outlets, one for our string lights (that one is mounted up high on the post to the left) and the other two for people who may want to charge their phone, plug in a heated blanket, etc. It's easy to run the wire now but would be a pain to add later once rock is added to the inside of the pit, so I tried to think ahead as much as possible. I ran liquid tight conduit from the panel to the firepit, it's unnecessary as this cable is made for direct burial, however I wanted the added protection as it's near our pool plumbing and wiring, and also wanted the option to pull additional wire if necessary. I ran the conduit from underground up the side of the posts, since they are backfilled with concrete I wanted the ability to pull wire through if something needed to be replaced rather than having the wire itself ran through the concrete and up the post. I used the Ideal wire strippers to remove the sheathing and also strip the conductor wires, worked great and worth the money.",

The cords are permanently attached to the panels and cannot be replaced, so I didn't want them exposed constantly to sunlight and weather. So I ordered a 10' roll of the 3/8th\" tubing. I measure out how much cable length I'd need plus a little slack, then I wrapped the excess around one or both of the panel/camera mounts (depending on how much unused cable length there'd be) and wrapped self-bonding silicone tape around the cable to secure/waterproof/protect it. Then I cut an appropriate length of the split tubing and slipped it over the exposed cable between the two, then for some cameras where necessary I cut a smaller piece or two and added them to the small amount of slack I left after the wrapping. Where appropriate I wrapped a small amount of the silicone tape on the ends to keep it in place/further waterproof it. This gives a clean, finished, and professional look. I was impressed with the results so much I've ordered more additional cameras, as well as to help reorganize some computer cable routing.

        "B0D2NZY48M ★★★★☆ <b>Nice assortment of wire for electronics bench work; don't go by current rating provided, though</b> I'm a hobbyist maker who creates and repairs electronics, including microcontroller and IoT projects. Having an assortment of wire on hand helps ensure I'm using the right wire for the job both in function and appearance (color coding). This assortment includes 8 spools of silicone insulated 18AWG wire in different colors, along with heatshrink tubing and wire ties in matching colors which is a nice touch for neater, more professional looking wiring jobs. The spools are included in a box with holes to allow for dispensing, but the spools lay flat in the box -- not on edge like other boxes of dispensable wire I have. This isn't really an issue, just an odd choice and it makes the box a bit wider and flatter compared to a vertical orientation. Also included is a very basic wire stripper, though I don't use it as I have more capable wire strippers at hand. I would tend to challenge the specs/rating sheet included. Generally I wouldn't suggest anywhere near 22A be run through 18AWG wire. More like half that, tops. While the silicone insultation will help reduce the chance of fire from an over current situation compared to PVC or other materials, it will still get very hot and is a grossly inefficient application of power, with so much energy being lost as heat due to the resistance of the wire. Further, seeing the recommendation here could lead the inexperienced to conclude that's a safe current for any similarly sized wire. Otherwise, I'm quite satisfied with this product."

You end up with DC applied to the solenoid on the control valve which works fine to open the valve. Sadly it magnetizes the valve which then never turns off again. Sent it back for a refund and for the same money bought a little controller I powered by the remaining two good wires I had. Bit sad really. I wanted it to work even though I knew I'd be overpaying for what it was - but it didn't."

        "B07MCF1BMP ★★★☆☆ <b>A very strange product. I would take 'outdoor rated' with a grain of salt</b> TL;DR version: If you intend to use this cable in an outdoor environment, I would look elsewhere. I have used several spools of this company's 3 conductor wire for various projects and it has worked out well. The conductors are not undersized, and the outer cable sheath is properly tough. So I decided to give their 2 conductor wire a try. It turned out to be a very oddly constructed 2 conductor cable. My biggest issue is that the outer protective layer is MUCH bigger than required. It is literally the same outer sheath size as the 3 conductor cable I have used often - it literally appears that they just pulled one conductor out of their 3 conductor cable, put it on a reel, and sold it. This is not great for a couple of reasons: 1) The cable is thicker than it needs to be (not space efficient), so anyone working with limited space for their wire runs, or wire runs that are visible (like low voltage outdoor LED lighting), may want to look elsewhere. 2) This stuff says it is outdoor rated. However it is outdoor rated for UV exposure only. Because there is so much empty space within the outer jacket, anyone wanting to use this outdoors in damp climates or around water (irrigation wiring, landscape lighting, etc) should realize that the outer jacket is going to rapidly fill up with water (and stay filled), causing several types of issues: - Electric issues: any minor wire scrapes or damage could result in hard-to-trace shorts or random voltage drops. - Extra water weight: The extra weight all of that water filling up the PVC jacket could be significant. I intended to use this cable for outdoor permanent installations of LED light strings, hung or mounted in various ways on my house and in landscaping. I live in a wet climate, and after a few months of rainy fall/winter/spring weather I estimate that the added weight of all that water filling up the empty space within the cable jacket would more than double the total weight of the cable runs. With a couple hundred feet of cable, that weight will add up pretty quickly. - Water damage: Depending on how/where your cabling is routed, you could essentially be installing a de-facto water pipe that will shunt rain and/or irrigation water through the excess space within the outer jacket and into areas of your walls/house that would otherwise have remained perfectly dry. A potential recipe for serious hidden water damage. I ended up returning this and buying a different product elsewhere."

This stuff is great. It's low cost (big deal for me), it's easy to cut/strip/solder, and it's not too stiff so it puts pressure on my light strings. It's great. I like that fact that it's black too so it doesn't show up in the yard or on the roof.

It’s a great wire for wiring low-voltage remote control deviced. Although the PVC insulation has a maximum voltage rating of 150 volts, this wire shouldn’t be used in circuits operating at voltages higher than 30 to 50 volts. I use a lot of low-voltage direct burial cable for everything from landscape lighting to irrigation valve control circuits. There are many brands to choose from and they all perform splendidly but none of them is inexpensive as this Honderson wire at approximately 24 cents a foot. This is directburial wire, but you do need to be aware of where you are burying it and the depth that you are burying it at so it’s not accidentally damaged. In some cases, in some locations, good wiring practices does call for it to be run in conduit."

This wire has fewer strands that are larger and a heavy PVC outer coating, compared to the small strand silicon coated wire I use for RC helicopters. This makes it stiffer, easier to route, and tougher. I wouldn't hesitate to walk on this wire or pull it across metal edges that would cut silicon insulation.

        "B0CN9FNFZC ★★★☆☆ <b>Handy multi-conductor cable; probably not quite 18ga?</b> As the title says, this multi-conductor cable will come in handy for a number of my DIY projects. Since some of those may involve something on my boat, having tinned conductors is a real plus -- it does help prevent corrosion of the copper, and you can see the tinned strands in one of my included photos. My one issue with this product is the claim that the conductors are 18 gauge. Granted, I don't plan to use this anywhere that I'll be pushing the limits of an 18ga wire, but I did want at least to test the claims. I don't have a great way of measuring the diameter of the wire, especially with twisted strands. This is technically what the wire gauge means. However, a wire's resistance is a function of its cross-sectional area, and there are numerous free online calculators to let you determine what the resistance of a certain gauge of wire should be for a given length of wire. Here's what you do: Search for wire resistance calculator Enter 18 gauge and 50 ft You get 0.319 ohms Measure the resistance of one conductor for the entire 50' spool Compare your resistance reading to what it should be As shown, I used the red conductor (they should all be the same) and I got between 0.38 and 0.40 ohms. Since the resistance is higher than it should be for 18 gauge, I can know with reasonable certainty that the wire is smaller than 18 gauge. In fact, a 19 gauge wire (uncommon in the US) should be right at 0.403 ohms for 50' of wire. This all may not sound like much, but the resistance is over 22% higher than it should be for 18ga, which means that you're getting 22% less copper than you're expecting. All that's to say that this product seems fine, and as long as you're not depending on the full conductivity of a true 18 gauge wire, you'll be good. However, I tend to score products pretty harshly when they make claims that they can't hold up to, and sadly that's the case with this cable. Buy it and use it, eyes wide open, or buy something else if you need a true 18 gauge wire."

I have had to throw away pure copper wire from the 70s since it develops green oxidation and is a pain to clean but have yet to have to clean tinned copper before crimping or soldering. This wire has fewer strands that are larger and a heavy PVC outer coating, compared to the small strand silicon coated wire I use for RC helicopters. This makes it stiffer, easier to route, and tougher. I wouldn't hesitate to walk on this wire or pull it across metal edges that would cut silicon insulation. The larger strands are also better for crimping since smaller strands are more likely to break at the crimp.

        "B0BGS5GRSK ★★★★★ <b>Reliable and Versatile</b> I recently purchased the 18 Gauge Wire 2 Conductor Electrical Wire for my automotive and lighting projects, and I am extremely satisfied with its performance. This wire is perfect for low voltage applications, such as automotive wiring, LED strips, lamp lighting, and marine projects. Therefore, I am giving it a five-star rating. The wire is made of high-quality 18 AWG stranded PVC cord, which provides excellent flexibility and durability. I have found that this flexibility makes it easy to route the wire in tight spaces and around corners without any issues. Additionally, the stranded construction ensures that the wire is resistant to breakage and can withstand the rigors of demanding applications. The tinned copper conductors are another great feature of this wire. The tinning process adds a layer of protection to the copper, making it more resistant to corrosion and extending the lifespan of the wire. This is particularly important for marine applications, where exposure to moisture and saltwater can be a concern. The 18/2 wire configuration, with two conductors, is suitable for a wide range of electrical projects. It allows for easy connection of various components, such as LED strips, lamps, switches, and more. The wire is color-coded, with one conductor in red and the other in black, making it simple to identify and connect the positive and negative terminals correctly. The length of the wire, 100ft (30.48m), provides ample supply for most projects, allowing for flexibility in routing and installation. The wire is neatly packaged and easy to handle, without any tangles or kinks. I have used this wire extensively in my automotive projects, and it has performed flawlessly. The low voltage rating of 12V ensures safe and reliable operation without any risk of electrical hazards. The wire's insulation is of high quality and provides excellent protection against short circuits and electrical interference. Overall, the 18 Gauge Wire 2 Conductor Electrical Wire is a reliable and versatile option for various electrical applications. Its flexibility, tinned copper conductors, and durable construction make it ideal for automotive, lighting, marine, and other low voltage projects. I would rate this wire five out of five stars for its quality, performance, and versatility.

It conforms to real AWG (not \"China Wire Gauge\" which always happens to be much thinner...). It's made of real copper that's been tinned for corrosion resistance. The silicone insulation is extremely flexible and can handle extreme temperatures better than regular insulation. In short, this is excellent wire for hard use/harsh environments. I think of marine use and automotive use where it will be exposed to the elements. Would also work well for use on ATV's or UTV's."

It has the preferred characteristics of copper (low resistance and flexibility) with the corrosion resistance of tin. I have had to throw away pure copper wire from the 70s since it develops green oxidation and is a pain to clean but have yet to have to clean tinned copper before crimping or soldering. This wire has fewer strands that are larger and a heavy PVC outer coating, compared to the small strand silicon coated wire I use for RC helicopters. This makes it stiffer, easier to route, and tougher. I wouldn't hesitate to walk on this wire or pull it across metal edges that would cut silicon insulation. The larger strands are also better for crimping since smaller strands are more likely to break at the crimp. The only negative is the large outer diameter will limit the number of runs you can have in small spaces. Excellent wire! Recommended!"

There are cheaper cables out there (and goodness knows, ALL cable was cheaper only 2-3 years ago, but that’s a different discussion!) but I figure, why gamble with something that’s going to be buried inside a wall carrying high voltage & current? Happy."

I added 3 couple outlets, one for our string lights (that one is mounted up high on the post to the left) and the other two for people who may want to charge their phone, plug in a heated blanket, etc. It's easy to run the wire now but would be a pain to add later once rock is added to the inside of the pit, so I tried to think ahead as much as possible. I ran liquid tight conduit from the panel to the firepit, it's unnecessary as this cable is made for direct burial, however I wanted the added protection as it's near our pool plumbing and wiring, and also wanted the option to pull additional wire if necessary. I ran the conduit from underground up the side of the posts, since they are backfilled with concrete I wanted the ability to pull wire through if something needed to be replaced rather than having the wire itself ran through the concrete and up the post.

We live in Mexico and it is not against code, but if you are concerned I would check with your local code. In addition this is an adult houshold (no kids), so we are aware of what his hooked up, and treat it accordingly. I know Sewell says not for 120v, but I am sure that is a safety statement so they do not get sued if something ever was to go wrong or was not installed properly. If I was to do it again I would sand the wall and ceiling where the wire will lay down to give a completely flat finish. By doing this I believe it would be completely invisible after painting as the thickness of the wire would not ahow up !nd allow a perfectly transparent finish.

The one 90° bend that he did do looks a little funky, but this (ghost wire) is SO much easier than trying to snake wires through the studs behind the drywall, which is really a virtually impossible task without removing the drywall, which is not happening... We will be repainting the walls in dark brown as the walls now (white±) reflect too much light with the new, more powerful 4K projector, so I am hoping that the paint virtually hides the ghost wire which is really only visible because the ghost wire color is a bit different than the walls (as they are now - white±).",

        "B079NXCN6B ★★★★★ <b>Choose Your Location Well</b> Choosing a strategic location for the Ghost Wire can affect its visibility. I tried to butt it against corners, door frames, and base board to minimize its visibility. Likes: It gets the job done without needing to drill through walls, floors, or ceilings and then \"fish\" for speaker wire behind the wall or between joists; After working out the first connection to a terminal, the rest of them were easy to do; When I connected my speakers, it worked the first time and I have had no problems with the sound; Without doing any feathering or texturing, It took a coat of paint and matched the existing wall color perfectly (I have to point out the tape to people in order to get them to notice that it's there.) Dislikes: Although we had freshly painted walls (professionally done), the adhesive likes to come loose in a few places even though it was thoroughly pressed against the wall upon installation (It's not the worst thing in the world but I don't like to see any gap between the tape and the wall); I needed a little more Ghost Wire than was on the 100' reel so I ordered another 25' which is not on a reel and had a lot more bubbling (didn't easily lay flat on the wall); At over a buck per linear foot, it is a bit too pricey to use in every room; the folded corners do have a tendency to stand out, literally. NOTE: You still need speaker wire to run from the terminals to the speakers (I have wall mounted speakers and use about 1 foot of regular wire per speaker) and from the terminals on the other end to the amplifier or other source. If you order banana plugs (either solid or braided wire) with the terminals, the plugs do not fit into the holes in the terminals and you have to use bare wire. If they would manufacture the terminals with slightly larger holes, it would be excellent. Maybe someday they will."

The main reason why I chose this wire over cheaper wire variety packs is because this wire has silicone insulation which is more durable, flexible, and heat resistant than conventional wire insulation. The silicone insulation did not disappoint. You can see in the video I attached that the insulation is quite resistant to heat and does not melt as easily. Notice the reaction of the bare wire to heat in the video as well. The wire is indeed tinned and when you heat it, the tinning material evaporates and the bare copper wire is left underneath. This is something you should take into consideration when connecting these wires to a terminal since the tinning should be removed in order to get a solid connection. Probably a regular lighter is more suited to this task than a blow torch. Overall I am very satisfied with this wire kit. The wire is all very high quality and perfect for automotive applications due to the heat and wear resistance of the silicone insulation. This kit also comes with a wire stripper, some zip ties, and heat shrink. I could care less about these extras but it might be a nice perk if you don't have these items already. I would highly recommend this kit if you need a variety of different colored wires for an automotive project. The silicone insulation is the best you can get."

All of my reviews are my own personal opinion and are completely honest no matter if I receive an item for free or I pay for it.

        "B0CLBHT8YX ★★★★☆ <b>Good for small projects</b> It seems I'm always scrounging for sections of wire on different RV projects and usually find something leftover from an older finished project that works but maybe is not the best (such as by adding pigtails). This has 5 fifty foot rolls of 5 colors that should end the scrounging. This is a copper clad aluminum core (CCA) wire. The copper reduces corrosion caused by moisture and oxidation and adds surface conductivity. I got it to use for some small 12V wiring projects in the RV (additional 12 volt computer fan for gas refrigerator cooling) and to have on hand when I just need some short lengths of wire. For reference, Cu Clad Al (CCA) wire can be used for main wire projects but at a much larger gauge as aluminum has a higher resistance than copper. 12 AWG is recommended for a 15 Amp 110V circuit and 10 AWG for a 20 Amp. This is a 36 strand 16 AWG braided wire so it's not made for heavy loads or 110 volt wiring. Specs are for up to 80 volts. The wire is flexible and there's enough copper coating for it to solder easily to itself. If there's trouble having the wire stick, a copper infused solder works. I used some lead free Rosin Core 2.0 Sn99 Ag0.3 Cu0.7 electronics solder and everything was sucked into the wire and stuck together. I couldn't find the percent by weight of copper anywhere on the rolls, package, or website. The range for CCA is anywhere from 10% to 24% by weight, with the more the better (but also more expensive). 15 small zip ties and 10 heat shrink tubes are included in the box. I'm never going to use this on a main AC wiring project but for small electrical projects, it's a good economical choice and should last a long time. If you don't want 5 colors and a dispenser box, 4-color roll packages of 100'/roll 16AWG of this brand are the same price if you shop around. 4 stars - copper specs not given."

U can tell the immediate difference in the flexibility of the sheathing. Like comparing thick racing engine plug wire to the cheap thin stuff. As for any soldering - stuffs great thou higher bond point u can tell its stronger. Any splices r handled with some new solder joint connectors I just happened to snatch up and this stuff worked great in those too. I did find that there is the slight possiblity of tearing open the silicone jacket of this stuff 'easier' over other types due to having easier stripping ability so yankin' on this stuff when routing any wire runs needs to b given some added care to avoid snags on anything sharp.

I am using this as a signal wire from remote/pendant mounted switches to control small relays. For this, it is well suited, possibly a little overkill. But I like having a little heavier gage than what it takes just to get the job done. In my experience, it lasts longer and more forgiving to unexpected issues and faults. The outer sheath is not terribly difficult to cut, but I do not think average use will cause damage to it. Probably not suited to use in a manufacturing plant where it would be subjected to many types of abuse. But for the average DIY home entrepreneur, it would likely be just fine. I think we all take better care of things when it is us who foot the bill to pay for them. The individual wires are color coded (think thermostat wire), so they are easily identifiable on each end. As mentioned they are tinned, so the are easily soldered as well. I like soldered connections. They are more trouble to install, but, when properly done, I feel they are extremely reliable and with lower resistance due to more surface contact area.

        "B0BXKLS2T4 ★★★★★ <b>Holy smokes these wires are exactly what they are</b> Used to supply hot and ground to auxiliary fuse block. Quality was good, was exactly as described, and my car hasn’t burned down yet. So if you want some wires, these are wires.",
        "B0CN9FNFZC ★★★★★ <b>Nice well made cable</b> Nice highly flexible 18 gage wire. It is tinned, so if you plan to solder, that is even better. I am using this as a signal wire from remote/pendant mounted switches to control small relays. For this, it is well suited, possibly a little overkill. But I like having a little heavier gage than what it takes just to get the job done. In my experience, it lasts longer and more forgiving to unexpected issues and faults. The outer sheath is not terribly difficult to cut, but I do not think average use will cause damage to it. Probably not suited to use in a manufacturing plant where it would be subjected to many types of abuse. But for the average DIY home entrepreneur, it would likely be just fine. I think we all take better care of things when it is us who foot the bill to pay for them. The individual wires are color coded (think thermostat wire), so they are easily identifiable on each end. As mentioned they are tinned, so the are easily soldered as well. I like soldered connections. They are more trouble to install, but, when properly done, I feel they are extremely reliable and with lower resistance due to more surface contact area. Soldering is not always an option, but these wires will do just fine when crimped as well.",

Even if thats all you need, what a waste of shipping 100' / 200' / 300' would be way more acceptable. The wire coating is nice, a bit soft for most of my applications, I generally prefer a stiffer more abrasion resistant wire, but the temp rating makes up for that. The included spools are nice, but opening is too small to fit my wire spool rack. Overall this size and length would be great for use in wiring aux lights, or running from a fuse panel to an accessory within the inside of a vehicle.",

The lights are powered by a low voltage cable under the walkways. Last Winter a mother fox made a temporary den for her cubs under one of the boardwalks. In the Spring we discovered that several of the marker lights wouldn't light up due to power cables that were chewed through by sharp little teeth. The foxes have moved on but we were faced with repairing the broken cable. That's why I got this cable. It's perfect for low voltage outdoor use. The outside jacket is thick and robust. It took a bit of careful cutting to strip it off without damaging the inside conductor wires. Once off, I noticed this isn't just a standard single channel insulator jacket. It actually has two channels -- one for each of the conductors. (See photo.) That's makes for very tightly insulated conductors that should provide enhanced protection in underground or very wet environments. When I stripped the two conductors, I noticed they are not tinned as stated in the product description. This may or may not be an issue for you. Tinned copper cable is easier to solder and also minimizes corrosion for non-soldered joints. I removed a star from an otherwise five star review due to this. Summary Comments If you don't need tinned copper cable for low voltage outdoor applications, this is a good choice.

To put this in perspective, I go through probably 100 ft. of automotive primary wire in any given week. I do a LOT of small electrical jobs for friends and family, everything from fixing headlights and wiring harnesses, to adding completely new circuits like heated seats or sound systems. I have 0 sound degradation when I use them for speaker wire. If you use it for that, something I've learned by a lot of real world trial and error, that may help someone else out there, is to run the speaker wires down the opposite side of the car you run the power wires; I don't know why it helps, someone who's smarter than I could tell you..maybe it helps cut out interference or something, but tbh I have no idea at all and am not educated enough on that to tell you the why, I just know that it really works. It's almost like some kind of weird, ancient, wiring feng-shui that yields better performance based on geographical location. Supernatural, ancient, far-east, geo-kinestethic techniques and practices aside, it really just helps get the desired result of clear, non-fuzzy sound... ...Ok! anyways, the crazy flexibility and high-strand count of the conductor inside the insulation makes it stupid dumb easy to push em through tight fitting holes without the need to alter the existing structure of something. They're surprisingly elastic, as well, which helps not tear off end bits of wire if you're like me and use an automatic wire stripper... and insist on having the tension permanently set to \"kill\" 😃. The elasticity of the insulation, which is made of/made with with silicone, also means if it gets caught while you run it, you step on it or slam it in something while pulling the wire, that won't (in my experience) compromise the conductor inside. I know that I SHOULD just replace that section of wire, even if it doesn't appear to be damaged, which I do when time and materials allow... and I know I SHOULD stop eating so much red meat, I know I SHOULD stop smoking, I know I SHOULD finally fix that back door screen that bangs every time the wind blows any faster than is required to move a stupid American Beauty grocery bag... my point is that I SHOULD do a lot of things, but don't always get to. in the real world sometimes you just aren't able to do things by the book, for whatever reason, and this wire hasn't let me down when those situations arise. I'll leave you with my answer to the question \"is this **** good enough to be the only wire ill use for automotive and small electronic applications moving forward?\"... ...\"bet\".

This kit is just what I needed. The box itself acts as a dispenser for the wires so you can keep every colour organised on its spool without it unwinding on you. My only issue with this design is, with the wire inside the box, you can't see how much you have left. With some colours, 16ft goes quickly. I absolutely enjoy the colour matching zip ties and heat shrink. I hate putting black heat shrink on coloured wire. Drives me crazy. When I first opened the box, I laughed at the wire stripper. I was going to bash it, but honestly, it's not bad. Works better and safer than me pushing wire between my thumb and pocket knife blade. The wire I show in the picture was stripped using the wire strippers provided. There are four different sized slots on the strippers for four different sized wires, but they aren't labelled, so be sure to double check before cutting in. The insulation on the wire is thick and flexible. The wire itself is flexible as well. I haven't noticed any issues quality control."

To put this in perspective, I go through probably 100 ft. of automotive primary wire in any given week. I do a LOT of small electrical jobs for friends and family, everything from fixing headlights and wiring harnesses, to adding completely new circuits like heated seats or sound systems. I have 0 sound degradation when I use them for speaker wire. If you use it for that, something I've learned by a lot of real world trial and error, that may help someone else out there, is to run the speaker wires down the opposite side of the car you run the power wires; I don't know why it helps, someone who's smarter than I could tell you..maybe it helps cut out interference or something, but tbh I have no idea at all and am not educated enough on that to tell you the why, I just know that it really works. It's almost like some kind of weird, ancient, wiring feng-shui that yields better performance based on geographical location. Supernatural, ancient, far-east, geo-kinestethic techniques and practices aside, it really just helps get the desired result of clear, non-fuzzy sound... ...Ok! anyways, the crazy flexibility and high-strand count of the conductor inside the insulation makes it stupid dumb easy to push em through tight fitting holes without the need to alter the existing structure of something. They're surprisingly elastic, as well, which helps not tear off end bits of wire if you're like me and use an automatic wire stripper... and insist on having the tension permanently set to \"kill\" 😃. The elasticity of the insulation, which is made of/made with with silicone, also means if it gets caught while you run it, you step on it or slam it in something while pulling the wire, that won't (in my experience) compromise the conductor inside. I know that I SHOULD just replace that section of wire, even if it doesn't appear to be damaged, which I do when time and materials allow... and I know I SHOULD stop eating so much red meat, I know I SHOULD stop smoking, I know I SHOULD finally fix that back door screen that bangs every time the wind blows any faster than is required to move a stupid American Beauty grocery bag... my point is that I SHOULD do a lot of things, but don't always get to. in the real world sometimes you just aren't able to do things by the book, for whatever reason, and this wire hasn't let me down when those situations arise. I'll leave you with my answer to the question \"is this **** good enough to be the only wire ill use for automotive and small electronic applications moving forward?\"... ...\"bet\".

Don't bother with CCA (copper clad aluminum) wire because not only do the strands break very easily, it does not hold up very well when exposed to moisture because it corrodes very quickly. If you've ever had wiring on a trailer fail on you without any signs of physical damage, most likely it was made out of CCA wire. Tinned copper wire is my preferred choice to use on trailer wiring because it'll withstand being exposed to the elements."

This is all tinned copper wire and designed for low voltage like car wiring. You get 50’ of both the black and red insulated wire. That is a great price, probably half of what I have seen wire selling for. The wire has good flexibility and has a good feel in your hands.

Having an assortment of wire on hand helps ensure I'm using the right wire for the job both in function and appearance (color coding). This assortment includes 8 spools of silicone insulated 18AWG wire in different colors, along with heatshrink tubing and wire ties in matching colors which is a nice touch for neater, more professional looking wiring jobs. The spools are included in a box with holes to allow for dispensing, but the spools lay flat in the box -- not on edge like other boxes of dispensable wire I have. This isn't really an issue, just an odd choice and it makes the box a bit wider and flatter compared to a vertical orientation. Also included is a very basic wire stripper, though I don't use it as I have more capable wire strippers at hand. I would tend to challenge the specs/rating sheet included. Generally I wouldn't suggest anywhere near 22A be run through 18AWG wire. More like half that, tops. While the silicone insultation will help reduce the chance of fire from an over current situation compared to PVC or other materials, it will still get very hot and is a grossly inefficient application of power, with so much energy being lost as heat due to the resistance of the wire. Further, seeing the recommendation here could lead the inexperienced to conclude that's a safe current for any similarly sized wire. Otherwise, I'm quite satisfied with this product."

This a good option to help you easily track the wiring for your projects without using red and black for everything. The quality seems to be great. The insulation is silicone which makes it easy to work with and the wire itself is tinned copper. This kit comes with color matching heat shrink tubing and zip ties also which is great if you are putting together a project and want it to really stand out. They also include a wire stripper which works surprisingly well. The box even doubles as a dispenser to keep it all organized while remaining accessible.

So far, this seems to be as good as anything I can source locally, and 10 cents a foot keeps the price competitive. I like the silicone jacket. It makes the wire very easy to work with. I was worried it wouldn’t hold up as well to the heat of soldering, but I was very careful and had no issues. It was too small to really use a crimp connector so I did mostly soldering and heat shrink. The tinned wire took solder well and I didn’t have any issues with connectivity or creating a solid connection. I didn’t have my calipers handy to check this versus other 20 AWG wire but it seemed comparable. Even so, sometime manufactures use more insulation and less metal to give it the impression that it is the same size. With wire I am unfamiliar with, I always size up against the standard AWG amp ratings just to be safe. It’s hard to say if the jacket will hold up to harsh conditions. For my purposes, it’s being used inside an enclosure and is well-protected. If you’re going to use this for automotive, marine or exterior projects, I’d leave a piece of wire outside for a while to test it before committing to a full project.

The quality of wire wasn’t as important for this so I didn’t mind taking a chance on an unknown brand. So far, this seems to be as good as anything I can source locally, and 10 cents a foot keeps the price competitive. I like the silicone jacket. It makes the wire very easy to work with. I was worried it wouldn’t hold up as well to the heat of soldering, but I was very careful and had no issues. It was too small to really use a crimp connector so I did mostly soldering and heat shrink. The tinned wire took solder well and I didn’t have any issues with connectivity or creating a solid connection. I didn’t have my calipers handy to check this versus other 20 AWG wire but it seemed comparable. Even so, sometime manufactures use more insulation and less metal to give it the impression that it is the same size. With wire I am unfamiliar with, I always size up against the standard AWG amp ratings just to be safe. It’s hard to say if the jacket will hold up to harsh conditions. For my purposes, it’s being used inside an enclosure and is well-protected. If you’re going to use this for automotive, marine or exterior projects, I’d leave a piece of wire outside for a while to test it before committing to a full project. Overall, a good value wire option if you don’t have a power hungry circuit where only the best will do."

I wouldn't recommend 20awg to be used for 120v applications. 16awg is generally used for most household devices using120VAC . At 12 volts, (cars, boats, golf carts, etc) this wire can handle general low current applications. Low current for 12v meaning less than 60W/5.00A @ 12ft length or shorter. This cable is not tinned, so it is best suited for interior environments as this wire is not rated to be used where water and moisture can corrode the copper over time, reducing conductivity. The cable is easy to work with using a good set of wire insulation removers (Amazon won't let me post what they really are called). The name of the one I used in the attached video is \"Capri Tools 20010 Precision Wire...\". I've used them for a few years now and I'll never go without one again. Best $30 ever spent on wire tools.

        "B096JZCT1B ★★★★★ <b>Fits the bill for the job</b> I’m a DIYer who recently ran a new five-conductor thermostat wire in preparation for adding a smart thermostat at an existing forced hot air furnace installation. I bought the 50 foot spool of thermostat wire for that project from a big box store. This item’s packaging, in contrast, comes in a cardboard box of significantly smaller dimension than the big box store’s spool of wire, which was in a clear plastic bag. As seen in the photo, the box is maybe 5 inches square and about a couple inches tall. I gave some thought to this. If I were an HVAC contractor, I think the smaller footprint of this item’s design would be a better approach for easy storage when in the field. But the downside to this is the wire’s coiled memory may make fishing the wire a bit more challenging than the wider diameter of the big box version. Aside from this interesting but probably trivial difference, this item seems perfect for its intended purpose. It strips well with the usual wire stripper tools. Continuity was verified with all five conductors. The conductors’ colors match industry standard. Coming from the aforesaid DIYer here, I guess you can take that with a healthy grain of salt :) but I think we’re on page that this the right design for thermostats needing five conductors. I intend to use this item to re-wire an existing smart thermostat installation at a different property, where the existing wiring is rather amusing but functional. I think this item is up to the task and look forward to using it. I think it will also serve me well when I take on some nifty Arduino project with external sensors that need to be wired up.

        "B0CKTBGCXV ★★★★☆ <b>Good heavy duty speaker wire, and light DC hook-up wire. Reasonable value</b> Cutting to the chase… I recommend this 14/2 wire for speakers, and for general purpose DC hook-up wire. My Customer experience with the product... This wire reasonably met expectations set in the products description. In general I found it easy to work with, and versatile. It cuts easily with wire cutters, while not being hard to strip with strippers, and it takes soldering as well as crimp fitting well. Pros: + Professional looking spool and wire. + The insulation feels adequate, and good quality. + The wire solders well. + works well with both soldered, and also with crimped connectors. Con: - None so far, I will update if anything comes up. All together: I feel this speaker / hook-up wire as decent value for money, works and performs exactly as expected and is both useful, and versatile for many projects. PLEASE NOTE: My reviews reflect my personal opinion of “customer experience” using the product(s). ** I thoroughly test items, and over time, will do updates as needed after prolonged use. 1 Star - Very poor customer experience - Failed to meet major parts of it’s description. 2 Stars – Poor experience - Mostly as described but is ‘second-rate’, and/or a very poor value. 3 Stars – Average experience - reasonably meets the expectation promised in it’s description. 4 Stars - Good experience - Meets all described expectation, and a reasonable value for money. 5 Stars – Absolutely EXCELLENT experience! - FAR OUTPERFORMED all expectations!",

        "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Nice design</b> This product has proven to be an excellent choice for my electrical projects, offering several key features that make it stand out from other wires on the market. The use of tinned copper wire is a significant advantage of this silicone wire. The tin layer serves as a protective barrier for the inner oxygen-free copper, preventing it from being oxidized. This feature enhances the wire's longevity and ensures consistent performance over time, even in demanding conditions. The soft silicone insulator on this wire makes it highly flexible, making it easy to handle and maneuver during installations. This flexibility is a real benefit when working in tight spaces or intricate electrical setups, as it allows for smooth routing and minimizes the risk of wire kinking or damage. The availability of six different colors in the spools is a practical and thoughtful feature. It makes it easy to distinguish between wires and simplifies identification in complex wiring configurations. This color-coding system has been invaluable in my projects, enabling me to work more efficiently and avoid any potential wiring errors. With its rating for all under 600V devices and a rated current of 12A, this silicone wire is suitable for a wide range of applications. Whether it's low-voltage electronic projects, DIY circuits, or even some home appliances, this wire can handle the task with ease and reliability."

Unfortunately, my house is full of poor wiring, so I have been working on getting everything up to par before I need to use my generator for an emergency. The wire comes in a plastic-wrapped roll with a couple bands around it. I'm used to Romex coming in the plastic roll that you can pull out of the middle, but this wasn't as easy as that. The wire is pliable, as I would expect 14 gauge wire to be, and it stripped well. I had to pull a number of lengths through flexible conduit and it was just stiff enough to push through without a fish tape if the conduit was straight. Overall, I give this wire high marks. I did not encounter any of it that had poor craftmanship, it works great for 15A circuits, and I haven't had an issue after using about 150 feet of it. I will order more and keep it on hand.",

It pulled about 900ma which means for that length of wire (eye-balled not measured) resistance is about 13 ohms. It glowed bright red. Note that wire increases in resistance as it is heated so this measurement will be higher than with an ohmmeter. I wrapped it around a pair of needle-nose pliers and pulled until it gave way. It required a few pounds of tension. Easily strong enough to use to cut Styrofoam, my opinion. I don't think copper will like the heat of a direct connection.

Il cavo è realizzato con rame stagnato di alta qualità, che garantisce una trasmissione affidabile del segnale e una maggiore resistenza alla corrosione nel tempo. La flessibilità del cavo è ottima, il che rende facile maneggiarlo e installarlo anche in spazi ristretti o complessi. Inoltre, la sezione trasversale di 0.3mm² è adatta per una varietà di applicazioni, dalla cablatura di dispositivi elettronici al collegamento di sensori e attuatori. Ho trovato che la saldatura su questo cavo sia stata estremamente semplice e pulita, grazie alla superficie stagnata che favorisce un'ottima adesione del saldatore. In conclusione, consiglio vivamente il cavo di prolunga Carlits 22AWG a chiunque abbia bisogno di un cavo di alta qualità per i propri progetti elettronici.

        "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>A must-have for a drive-thru gate</b> We grow 5 acres of sweet corn for our farm stand, and use an electric fence around the perimeter to keep varmints, mostly raccoons, out of it. A small family of raccoons can easily do $500-worth of damage in a single night, so it needs to be as protected as we can get it. The low-impedance charger is in the barn, with a lead wire taking the charge out to the fence. That would work OK without some of this wire - until we took the tractor or pickup out to pick some corn for the stand. For that, a drive-thru gate is needed. A buried wire/cable is the most practical way to build one of those, IF the wire is designed to be buried, as this one is. We won't need the fence for six months, so I haven't had a chance to actually use it yet. But, this looks to be much stronger and more durable, less prone to breakage from driving over it, than any gate wire we've used so far. An excellent value.",

I didn't want to go the PVC route and wanted something that didn't take up much room when I store it and this fits the bill. I just tied the bunch together and hang it on the fence when not in use. I but two rolls of it and that was good because you use it up fast because it's thick. I think I got maybe a dozen hoops 3 ft high out of a roll, maybe a little more. That corresponds to probably each piece 8 or so feet long when you count the foot they're in the ground on each side. It's strong enough that I can stick it straight in the ground a foot and it will maintain its shape. A lighter gauge I'd probably have to put a metal or PVC tube of some kind in the ground and put the wire inside the tube. One caveat: given the thickness of this gauge I had to buy a special cutter for it. This cutter just barely does the job but for the amount I need to use it I wasn't going to pay more than $10 - $12 for a$30 cutter that would go through it like butter. Don't think you're going to cut this with tin snips or dikes because you aren't.

Of course, when replacing old wiring, you are also gaining the safety of a cord that is using modern insulating materials, which is much safer at this point, than older wiring which may have very dry and brittle insulation layers between the strands of wire. The only comment I can make about it that may be a negative factor for some is that the cord is round, rather than most lamp cord that tends to be a bit flattened.

Even veteran contractors often do not know this product exists and it is a lifesaver. Due to the increase in use of Wi-Fi thermostats, which require a common, more people are using similar products. This is because Wi-Fi thermostats require a common . If a common ids required, you must have a minimum of five wires and many homes were wired with four wires if they had single stage heat abd mercury thermostats. This is a common issue with older hones. Another issue is that Low-voltage wiring is very fine and it is hard copper, not stranded. So, age can allow for deterioration and breakage causing problems. Since thermostat wires can be very difficult to pull, depending on if the wire is nailed inside the trusses, inside the walls, in a multi level home or condo, this product can also provide a replacement for a broken wire for a standard stat. This inexpensive product allows us to forgo running a new thermostat wire, at several hundred dollars expense to the customer. We can provide a replacement wire for a daily wine when pulling a new wire is difficult or cost prohibitive, or provide the common needed when needed for a wifi stat when only 4 wires exist. However, it is really designed for a professional to use not for the homeowner. It seems easy enough but truthfully a homeowner risks shorting tge unit or injuring themselves if they don't have the knowledge BBC a s it gets wired inside the air handler/furnace, as well as at the thermostat."

I tested the wire's resistance and per the American Wire Gauge (AWG) Table, I should get 6.4 ohms resistance per 1000 feet of 18 gauge wire. I don't have a multimeter sensitive enough to measure just 23 feet of wire as in this kit, but my multimeter was bouncing between .1 and .2 ohms. Right in the ballpark of .14 ohms for 23 feet that I calculate I should have. Sorry I didn't have enough hands to measure the wire and get a picture too. I also held the wire over a flame for several seconds. The insulation stood up just fine without and visible damage to the wire. The wire itself is very flexible and I like the silicone insulation. I didn't think too much of the little wire stripper/cutter included in the kit. But, it will work if you don't already have proper tools. The little zip ties are handy, but so few won't last too long! One more thing is I thought the kit is a little spendy for what you get. But, if you need several colors of wire, but not much of it, this may work for you. Better than buying several larger rolls that you don't end up using most of.

I had to install some outlets where things were being moved and where things were missing. Used the 12/2 on a 20 amp circuit to wire everything. This wire is easy to use, pulls nicely, and served the purpose perfectly. 50 feet was more than enough for my uses, and I have some left over. I liked this brand so much, I went back and ordered another 100 foot roll for a full replacement (found some old knob and tube). I'll run the 100 foot directly to the breaker box. Recommend this, gave good results and no issues.",

The color coding on the wires is perfect and makes it so easy to wire up to the thermostat and the furnace unit. My thermostat wiring is fairly easy to get to and I had the new wire ran and installed in about 2hrs. I would highly recommend this, it is way cheaper than what I could find at my local lumber yards.",

Now, I have smart thermostats. Now I need a common wire. Now I was quoted a few hundred dollars for the wiring and connection. Now I have the wire I need, and can run it myself, and only have to pay for the connection to my zone thing. I don't know the proper name for the thing that allows the connection of multiple thermostats, but I know it sets the zones. Wire is good. Has what you need. If you are using just heat, then you will have extra wires. If you have heat and air conditioning, then this is perfect for your need. Ever since installing this wiring, I no longer need to take my thermostats off the wall to charge with a USB cable. Now they take power from the system, and work perfectly all the time."

For whatever reason, so were taken out by ripping the plastic conduit off the boxes and the wires just cut off. How it ever passed home inspection is beyond me, but being the electrician that I am, I have been working on replacing them.

        "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★☆ <b>Nice Variety in this kit for DIY projects</b> I got this kit for all the little wiring jobs around the house -- repairing things, wiring trailer lights, putting up LED lights, etc. This kit is a nice little kit with lots of variety to get different, small jobs done. I tested the wire's resistance and per the American Wire Gauge (AWG) Table, I should get 6.4 ohms resistance per 1000 feet of 18 gauge wire. I don't have a multimeter sensitive enough to measure just 23 feet of wire as in this kit, but my multimeter was bouncing between .1 and .2 ohms. Right in the ballpark of .14 ohms for 23 feet that I calculate I should have. Sorry I didn't have enough hands to measure the wire and get a picture too. I also held the wire over a flame for several seconds. The insulation stood up just fine without and visible damage to the wire. The wire itself is very flexible and I like the silicone insulation. I didn't think too much of the little wire stripper/cutter included in the kit. But, it will work if you don't already have proper tools. The little zip ties are handy, but so few won't last too long! One more thing is I thought the kit is a little spendy for what you get. But, if you need several colors of wire, but not much of it, this may work for you. Better than buying several larger rolls that you don't end up using most of. Overall, a solid product that I can recommend, given the above comments. In my book, a solid 4 star product, very useful and a quality product. But, nothing too special. This product was provided to me through the Amazon Vine Program, on which I only pay the taxes on this product."

I also used the Wago 221-412 lever nuts connecting the pigtails to the switches. Since each switch needed 4 connectors, the small Wagos made it very easy! As always, do things meticulously when doing wiring! Always visually ensure the all wires are inserted fully into each connector.

I’ve been very impressed with its versatility, durability, and ease of use. The wire is made of galvanized steel, which makes it resistant to rust and corrosion. It’s also quite strong and can be used for a wide range of tasks, from bundling cables to hanging plants. I’ve used the wire to secure my garden hose, hang bird feeders, and even create a makeshift trellis for my climbing plants. It’s been up to the task in every situation. The wire is also very easy to use. It’s soft and pliable, so you can easily bend and shape it with your hands. I’ve found that it’s much easier to work with than some of the stiffer utility wires I’ve used in the past. Overall, I’m very pleased with the OOK 50143 Solid Utility Wire. It’s a versatile, durable, and easy-to-use product that’s perfect for a variety of DIY projects. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality utility wire"

The cords are permanently attached to the panels and cannot be replaced, so I didn't want them exposed constantly to sunlight and weather. So I ordered a 10' roll of the 3/8th\" tubing. I measure out how much cable length I'd need plus a little slack, then I wrapped the excess around one or both of the panel/camera mounts (depending on how much unused cable length there'd be) and wrapped self-bonding silicone tape around the cable to secure/waterproof/protect it. Then I cut an appropriate length of the split tubing and slipped it over the exposed cable between the two, then for some cameras where necessary I cut a smaller piece or two and added them to the small amount of slack I left after the wrapping. Where appropriate I wrapped a small amount of the silicone tape on the ends to keep it in place/further waterproof it. This gives a clean, finished, and professional look. I was impressed with the results so much I've ordered more additional cameras, as well as to help reorganize some computer cable routing.

        "B01M8F9ZVX ★★★★★ <b>Works great for creating HT counterpoises.</b> I'm a ham operator and purchased this to construct HT counterpoises. My previous counterpoise was regular insulated copper wire and it became a pain keeping it straight, as to store the 19.5\" wire when not in use you wrap it around the HT. When unwrapping it the wire would retain the bends and would not hang straight down as you want. Trying to smooth it out and remove the bends was pretty much pointless, and it would want to keep curling back. Then when you stowed your HT, it would happen again when you pulled it out again and unwound it. I saw a recommendation to use silicone-insulated wire as it was much more flexible. I gave it a shot, and it is indeed much better for this purpose. The wire retains a little bit of memory when you unwind it, but a few smoothing passes of your hand down it gets it pretty straight, and it will \"loosen up\" even more over time. I get better performance out of this compared to my prior counterpoise, but that could be the result of intentionally going down a wire gauge to a thicker wire, the line staying straighter, the increased number of strands inside compared to the previous wire, the difference in connecting (soldering a wire loop versus using a terminal ring) or a combination of all four."

        "B0BYNNJS8B ★★★★★ <b>Good Quality, High Temp Wire</b> I work on a lot of electronics requiring 12-gauge wire and recently procured this wire for a couple of my projects. I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful."

If you are using this for some basic stuff like lights or 12v applications, then it's really not a big deal but I would not use this for anything drawing any sort of amps over 10 and certainly would not put this behind a wall."

        "B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★☆ <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again)."

Then I just fed back the extra wire until the plug was mounted. Gotta plan accordingly so you retain the wire sheathing at the connector if you do it that way. Finally had a use for my hex sockets when torquing these. Highly recommend mounting it in the box and pulling the plug back out and retorquing because I did that by chance and found I could get a little bit more tight in the connections. 6/3 wire is no joke.

I was originally looking at 5-wire cables (after all, that's all I really needed), but then I saw this 18-gauge, 8-wire cable for just a few dollars more and decided to go with it instead. This would provide a degree of future-proofing (such as adding a whole-house humidifier, extra sensors, or the like in the future). This 18-gauge, 8-wire cable was thicker and stiffer than my old 20-gauge (?), 4-wire cable, and thus a bit trickier to pull through the wall from the thermostat to the furnace (be sure to check your cable path first to ensure it will fit (width of thru-holes, radius of bends, etc.). But, I just taped one end of the new cable to the old cable, crossed my fingers, and started a pullin'. Thankfully, with a bit of elbow grease, it worked! It looks and feels high quality and came in ample length for my needs (and then some). I used a 'Uxcell a10073000ux0031 2 Pcs 8 Position Double Row Screw Terminal Covered Barrier Strip 600V 25A' to connect the new 8-wire cable (right) to the existing furnace wiring (left)."

This makes it stiffer, easier to route, and tougher. I wouldn't hesitate to walk on this wire or pull it across metal edges that would cut silicon insulation.

        "B07GH7JHG9 ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Beware of Copper Clad Aluminum Wire!</b> When shopping for Cat5e or Cat6 network cables, make sure you are comparing apples to apples. One of the most common tactics of the “low cost leaders” is to use aluminum instead of copper wire. This can lead to network issues from using inferior materials to transmit the signal. Looking to cut costs, manufacturers started using aluminum wire dipped in a thin coating of copper. This technique created an aluminum core cable surrounded by a thin layer of copper. The performance and safety of CCA cables are radically different. In fact, aluminum network cables violate TIA and IEC standards for Cat5e and Cat6 cables. CCA cable has higher attenuation than pure copper cables. This results in a greater loss of data, as packets have to be re-transmitted. The more data that is re-transmitted, the slower your network performs. Plus, these problems are compounded by every foot of cable you use; the longer the cable, the worse the performance. CCA cables also have a 55% higher DC resistance. This increases the amount of energy that is transferred into heat and reduces the amount of power that can be transferred. This issue makes them unusable for power over Ethernet (PoE) devices like IP cameras and phones. These cut corners also affect installers because aluminum wire creates installation issues. Due to the lower tensile strength, aluminum cables can be damaged when being pulled. Single conductors can break, making the cable useless, or the whole cable can snap. Aluminum also has a lower bend radius than pure copper cables. This means you can’t bend it as much before it fails. In short, spend the extra money on solid core copper cable."

Just plain old copper wire. My only issue is the color. Red and black? Why? In US households, black is standard for the hot lead; white for neutral. Okay; maybe I’m just picky?! Is color why it’s more reasonably priced than alternatives? Regardless, it worked well for my kitchen lighting project. Twists well. Doesn’t break easily. Good insulation.",

I've now ordered this 16 Gauge, UL 2464 Tinned Copper Stranded Wire for LED Lighting in 3 different flavors. I got the 3 wire / conductor, the 5 wire, and now the 4 wire. The 5 wire is great for LEDs with a DC dimmer (AC - hot, neutral, ground & DC positive, negative for my dimmer switch). Boom! all done 1 cable. I got the 4 wire for my third LED high bay; I already had an available ground in the rafters next to the fixture. I ran the cable down and 2 AC wires (hot to toggle switch, neutral to neutral) & 2 wires for DC dimmer. Done. The 3 wire I used for my first High Bay - I had another two wire cable for the dimmer. I had to zip-tie those two together. The wire is - 16 gauge tinned copper - nice supple / pliable PVC insulated outside diameter is a spit bigger than 5/16\" (fits well in NPT3/8\" cable gland) . The Engineering Tool Box specs this wire at 6 amp carrying capacity up to 1000v @ 30 deg. C (86 F) ambient temperature. There is a .71 correction factor for temperatures between 41 - 45 deg. C (105 - 113 deg. F) So: 6(amps) x .71 = 4.26 4.26 amps is enough amperage for (3) 150w LED lamps. I'm using each cable for one fixture – I prefer to have the amperage up there for additions and the extra cost is minimal. I don't mind the extra cost for the marine rated tinned copper, but this company sells the same cable in the non-tinned flavor also. This is quality cable and makes for quick easy installations. I'll call that 5 Stars Thanks for Reading Tip: Don't get your crires wossed. Make a schematic – if you put AC power on the DC side your likely to fry your lamp."

The length of the wire, 100ft (30.48m), provides ample supply for most projects, allowing for flexibility in routing and installation. The wire is neatly packaged and easy to handle, without any tangles or kinks. I have used this wire extensively in my automotive projects, and it has performed flawlessly. The low voltage rating of 12V ensures safe and reliable operation without any risk of electrical hazards. The wire's insulation is of high quality and provides excellent protection against short circuits and electrical interference. Overall, the 18 Gauge Wire 2 Conductor Electrical Wire is a reliable and versatile option for various electrical applications.

        "B08TB4BVV9 ★★★★★ <b>1920s look without the risk of actual 1920s wiring.</b> It never looks right to restore an older electrical device with new AC cord. The trick then is finding fabric-wrapped cord that is safe and at least has the appearance of electrical cord from the 20s and 30s. Luckily, a variety of providers have arisen over the past few years. Here we have one where most of the work has been done for you, with the AC plug already connected. Now there's no question that this is a contemporary AC plug, and if you're doing a genuine restoration, you probably won't go this route, but there's also no question that this is a safe approach and one that is probably going to be hidden by furniture anyway. In this case, the fabric wrap covers two independently insulated wires, already stripped and soldered and ready to be wired directly into your device, lamp, appliance, etc. The fabric has a nice sheen and looks great; I picked the brown color to go with a copper lamp - works perfectly.",
        "B08TB4BVV9 ★★★★★ <b>Nice Cord, Good Length.. just a little short of what I needed.</b> Nice Cord, Good Length.. just a little short of what I needed. I am saving it for another project. It is ready hook up to a nice lamp. I got it to add a plug to a ceiling fixture. It would work; but it was not long enough to reach any of my outlets.",
        "B08TB4BVV9 ★★★★★ <b>Upgrade</b> I am using this to replace the cord in a hanging lamp I recently got. Black is a better color for me. These round, fabric cords are a bit more stylish than the usual flat, plastic cords, and there doesn't seem to be a lot of manufacturers, so it's nice to find a large selection. Overall, a good quality product."

        "B0CN768S54 ★★★★★ <b>AC & DC sides - Same Bat Cable, Same Bat Time</b> I like this wire. I like this companies products. I've now ordered this 16 Gauge, UL 2464 Tinned Copper Stranded Wire for LED Lighting in 3 different flavors. I got the 3 wire / conductor, the 5 wire, and now the 4 wire. The 5 wire is great for LEDs with a DC dimmer (AC - hot, neutral, ground & DC positive, negative for my dimmer switch). Boom! all done 1 cable. I got the 4 wire for my third LED high bay; I already had an available ground in the rafters next to the fixture. I ran the cable down and 2 AC wires (hot to toggle switch, neutral to neutral) & 2 wires for DC dimmer. Done. The 3 wire I used for my first High Bay - I had another two wire cable for the dimmer. I had to zip-tie those two together. The wire is - 16 gauge tinned copper - nice supple / pliable PVC insulated outside diameter is a spit bigger than 5/16\" (fits well in NPT3/8\" cable gland) . The Engineering Tool Box specs this wire at 6 amp carrying capacity up to 1000v @ 30 deg. C (86 F) ambient temperature. There is a .71 correction factor for temperatures between 41 - 45 deg. C (105 - 113 deg. F) So: 6(amps) x .71 = 4.26 4.26 amps is enough amperage for (3) 150w LED lamps. I'm using each cable for one fixture – I prefer to have the amperage up there for additions and the extra cost is minimal. I don't mind the extra cost for the marine rated tinned copper, but this company sells the same cable in the non-tinned flavor also. This is quality cable and makes for quick easy installations. I'll call that 5 Stars Thanks for Reading Tip: Don't get your crires wossed. Make a schematic – if you put AC power on the DC side your likely to fry your lamp."

It is a reasonable facsimile for either replacing antiquated electrical wiring in old lamps and such, or adding a little extra visual flair to current devices.

The only comment I can make about it that may be a negative factor for some is that the cord is round, rather than most lamp cord that tends to be a bit flattened.

The cord looks as good in person as the photos show. It is a reasonable facsimile for either replacing antiquated electrical wiring in old lamps and such, or adding a little extra visual flair to current devices. Of course, when replacing old wiring, you are also gaining the safety of a cord that is using modern insulating materials, which is much safer at this point, than older wiring which may have very dry and brittle insulation layers between the strands of wire. The only comment I can make about it that may be a negative factor for some is that the cord is round, rather than most lamp cord that tends to be a bit flattened. This may also have something to do with this cord being a little stiffer than the typical lamp cord you may be most familiar with."

This 18G wire is great to splice into the 12G, and provide power to small groups of lights that are placed a bit further away from the big cable. When I opened the package, I noticed one thing I did not consider: This wire has a single outer mantle, and 2 wires inside it (instead of having 2 wires externally). This makes it harder to use the snap-in connectors, since you have to cut the mantle to expose the inner wires. Therefore, since this is advertised for 'landscape lighting', I cannot give it a full 5 stars. 4 stars will have to do."

        "B07MCF1BMP ★★★☆☆ <b>A very strange product. I would take 'outdoor rated' with a grain of salt</b> TL;DR version: If you intend to use this cable in an outdoor environment, I would look elsewhere. I have used several spools of this company's 3 conductor wire for various projects and it has worked out well. The conductors are not undersized, and the outer cable sheath is properly tough. So I decided to give their 2 conductor wire a try. It turned out to be a very oddly constructed 2 conductor cable. My biggest issue is that the outer protective layer is MUCH bigger than required. It is literally the same outer sheath size as the 3 conductor cable I have used often - it literally appears that they just pulled one conductor out of their 3 conductor cable, put it on a reel, and sold it. This is not great for a couple of reasons: 1) The cable is thicker than it needs to be (not space efficient), so anyone working with limited space for their wire runs, or wire runs that are visible (like low voltage outdoor LED lighting), may want to look elsewhere. 2) This stuff says it is outdoor rated. However it is outdoor rated for UV exposure only. Because there is so much empty space within the outer jacket, anyone wanting to use this outdoors in damp climates or around water (irrigation wiring, landscape lighting, etc) should realize that the outer jacket is going to rapidly fill up with water (and stay filled), causing several types of issues: - Electric issues: any minor wire scrapes or damage could result in hard-to-trace shorts or random voltage drops. - Extra water weight: The extra weight all of that water filling up the PVC jacket could be significant. I intended to use this cable for outdoor permanent installations of LED light strings, hung or mounted in various ways on my house and in landscaping. I live in a wet climate, and after a few months of rainy fall/winter/spring weather I estimate that the added weight of all that water filling up the empty space within the cable jacket would more than double the total weight of the cable runs. With a couple hundred feet of cable, that weight will add up pretty quickly. - Water damage: Depending on how/where your cabling is routed, you could essentially be installing a de-facto water pipe that will shunt rain and/or irrigation water through the excess space within the outer jacket and into areas of your walls/house that would otherwise have remained perfectly dry. A potential recipe for serious hidden water damage. I ended up returning this and buying a different product elsewhere."

The PVC insulation is tough and will stand up to abrasion. This cable should not be used for line voltage applications as the insulation is not rated for that application. I use 14/2 cable in my landscape lighting for the final connections to groups of LED fixtures. I use 12/2 for distribution over long distances to get to the clusters of fixtures. 14/2 works great in that application and helps to save a little money compared to running 12/2 everywhere. If your cable runs are all short and you have a modest number of LED fixtures then 14/2 may be good enough for the entire system. Note that 14/2 cable has a lower current rating than 12/2 cable, which is counterintuitive given the numbers are getting smaller as ampacity increases. So if you've got really long cable runs you'll probably want to use the 12/2 instead."

When it comes to outdoor, 12v landscape lights, you need to properly size the cable for the circuit. To do that, you take the number of lights you want to have on one circuit, and multiply by the number of watts. Nowadays, a typical LED type, 12 v light is in the 3 to 5 watt range. This is solid copper (the good stuff) 16 gauge cable, so it can handle up to 13 amps (which is about 1,500 watts!) but voltage does drop over distance. So this could easily handle one of the outdoor lighting kits or if you just want to add some more lights. (Old style, incandescent lights are a different story) 100% pure copper, direct burial, can't get much better than that, especially at this price"

        "B0CSD3GJ53 ★★★★★ <b>Great wire, but not compatible with some crimp connectors</b> I installed our landscape lighting almost 2 decades ago. Some bulbs have gone out due to failing electrical connectors. I tried replacing the connectors, but the insulation on the existing wire has become so hard that the prongs on the connectors just don’t penetrate correctly anymore. I ordered this to replace that hardened landscape wire. Unfortunately, the Quic Disc connectors I used previously do not work with this wire. Its insulation is slightly thinner than the original wire, and the conductors are spaced closer together. The Quic Disc prongs don’t align properly with the new conductors. If one prong hits the center of one conductor, the other prong can miss the other conductor entirely. The lights are only a few feet apart in a long flower bed, and I didn’t want to cut this wire into many short segments to use wire nuts at each light. So I tried the new Malibu Low Voltage Cable Connectors that pierce the insulation from both sides. They work perfectly, and have the advantage that the wire doesn’t have to be split apart every few feet to use an alternate piercing connector. Bottom line, this is great wire, with real copper conductors and flexible insulation that is easy to work with. It just isn't compatible with crimp connectors that expect the conductors to have the same spacing as in old 12 gauge landscape wire.",

        "B0CSD35PQT ★★★★☆ <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone."

It is solid copper, and not plated like you'll get with lower priced wire. The price is at least 25% less than what you'll pay in a big box store. The connectors don't come with instructions although they are somewhat intuitive to install. Installation goes much easier if you attach the connector to the 14 gauge wire first by separating about 3\" of the two 14 gauge vconductors. Then unscrewing the larger size cap end of the connector. Underneath the cap you'll see a long metal pin. The pin will pierce the insulation of the wire when you screw the cap back on the connector. Once you have it attached to the 14 gauge wire unscrew the cap on the other end of the connector. This cap will have a small hole in which you insert the stripped end of whatever wire is coming from the light fixture you're trying to attach. Make sure you strip about a half an inch of insulation off that wire. I inserted this wire through the hole of the cap and then into the open end of the connector. They'll be a small metal rod sticking up and you want to press the wire in as far as it'll go and then screw the cap back on. If all went well the pressure of the cap will hold the wire inside the connector. I'm not sure about the weather resistance of the metal used inside this connector so I used some electrical corrosion prevention paste, which is a dark gray silicon based gel that is sold to help weatherproof outdoor electrical connections or when you're dealing with aluminum wiring. Hopefully the paste will make the connection more weather resistant. So far they've been out in the yard for a few months and I haven't had any issues.",

        "B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ <b>Good low voltage wire, if you actually need 4 conductors</b> I see nothing to fault here. I joined two of the conductors together to form a 200-ft loop for a resistance test and it measured 0.9 ohms (after subtracting 0.1 for my test leads). That’s about right for 16 AWG wire. And I love how they included heat shrink to protect your crimp points. This is for low voltage applications, as indicated in the product title. I realize that (at least at the time of this writing) the product description claims it can handle up to 600V, but I’m fairly certain it’s not UL listed for that to comply with electrical code. If you want to run full line voltage outdoors without conduit then you should be looking for UF-B wire and there are rules about how deep you have to bury it (usually one foot at the very least — and that’s assuming you have ground fault protection). This product is either for low voltage landscape lighting (12-24V) or telecommunications. You don’t normally need four conductors for lighting, but I’ll leave that to you to figure out. Maybe you’re trying something fancy."

The pictures and description properly describe the item so no issues with false advertising or exaggerated claims. Economical choice for when you have a short run all on the same circuit.",
        "B07C5V9RVB ★★★★★ <b>Just works - hardy!</b> Bought a first of this two summers ago and had a contractor bury it in my rather large backyard. He did a poor job burying it and like some poor contractors in my area abandoned the job and I never got around to hire a right guy to continue until last week. I was worried that the poor quality burying (it was left in open surface in many many areas) the cable will have problems - particularly after kids played with these. Of course it wasn’t connected or anything. This week when I had a contractor use for my landscaping lights, this thing just worked and without much attenuation power losses!! No breaks. No problems. Basically it does it’s job! It came with its wooden bobbin and it was left under a tree in seattle weather - was holding up very well. Guess what, I ordered another one of these to add more landscaping lights around my backyard! Fun! Updates: the cables passed a hot summer test. All good.",

        "B000W4EWEE ★★★☆☆ <b>Wire is a bit brittle, or I got a bad roll</b> I've used this brand wire before (12/2) to wire my garage, and was quite pleased, so I thought I'd give this a shot to add a couple of outlets to my deck. I've ran 14-ga wire many times, and this wire is the correct thickness solid-core, and came in the correct length, BUT, this roll was bit brittle. I had one section that required a 90-deg bend under my deck... the neutral wire broke inside the sheathing, which caused me to have to trash that section and re-run it with a different brand/manufacturer wire I had. I wasn't happy about the break, but the rest of the roll was able to be used elsewhere in the build to wire low-amp/load LED dusk-to-dawn coach-lamps on each side of my garage doors (so none was really wasted). Maybe the break was just a factory-defect? Still, though, I will not likely buy this brand of 14-ga wire again, unless it is all that is available.",

I have a big 12 volt converter with only three LED lights for my flagpole, I'm going to expand the yard lights around the front and sides, the street view of the house. Not only will it look nice, it adds security, bad people like darkness for cover, they'll pass up a well lit house and look for an easier target. This 12 gauge will be the main feed line from the converter, from it I'll tap into it with a lighter wire for each lamp. All I need is to cut a slot in the grass a couple inches deep with a shovel and pull the sod back, drop the wire in and fold the sod back over it, this wire is meant to be directly buried in such manner making it quick and easy.

I use a lot of low-voltage direct burial cable for everything from landscape lighting to irrigation valve control circuits. There are many brands to choose from and they all perform splendidly but none of them is inexpensive as this Honderson wire at approximately 24 cents a foot. This is directburial wire, but you do need to be aware of where you are burying it and the depth that you are burying it at so it’s not accidentally damaged.

The ETL certification seems to check out online, and the cable is appropriately marked on the exterior surface as required. I ripped, zipped and stripped the wires in the cable with no problems. They twist how I typically expect stranded wire to behave. Nothing odd here. As to value, if I am reading the Amazon listings correctly cable from Frudrik is currently $100 for 265 feet, yet there is another roll of the same exact 14/2 cable by the same manufacturer, by the same seller, for the price of ($84 reg) $73 discount for 250 feet. That's $25 more for the added 15 feet (ouch). At the time I wrote this you can search \"FRUDRIK Low Voltage Landscape Lighting Wire\" and find it.

I ran 12v LED Headlights and tail lights on my golf cart. I ran a 12v actuated valve on this wire. I have plans for landscape lighting but am playing with solar lights at the moment so I may never get there. Funny that the one thing it is really intended for I may never use it for! I'm sure I'll have a stereo install in the future for my son and this can work for speaker wire too. Lots of low voltage uses.

I'm not sure if the casing is vinyl or silicone but it's on the ridged side because of the thickness. It's fine stranded oxygen free copper so it can be directly buried or used in conduit. I direct buried mine in the flowerbeds and under the sidewalk but saw cut a small section in the sidewalk where I couldn't access the opposite side to retrieve the wire. Sealed well with sikaflex that matches the concrete but the round wire isn't the best for that type of installation.

I had bought 2 packs :'-( The ones that I did use were excellent! I had to splice (3) 10G wires and (1) 18G wire together near a small goldfish pond (read, moist soil), and this fit perfectly and screwed on nice and tight. The caulk on the inside sealed them up perfectly, so even after burying them in the wet soil there was no voltage drop. As others said, the caulk is SUPER sticky!! After I screwed each one on, though, I picked up some dirt and rubbed it in to my hands; that worked fine to remove the stickiness, and washed off later with no problem. I kind of think that I could have saved some money by using regular wire nuts and just squirting silicone caulk in it before screwing in the wire, but I'm not positive it would have been the same. These were good for the job, though, I just wish that I would have realized that I had overpurchased earlier so I could at least return one of the packs.",

The PVC insulation is tough and will stand up to abrasion. This cable should not be used for line voltage applications as the insulation is not rated for that application. I use 14/2 cable in my landscape lighting for the final connections to groups of LED fixtures. I use 12/2 for distribution over long distances to get to the clusters of fixtures. 14/2 works great in that application and helps to save a little money compared to running 12/2 everywhere. If your cable runs are all short and you have a modest number of LED fixtures then 14/2 may be good enough for the entire system. Note that 14/2 cable has a lower current rating than 12/2 cable, which is counterintuitive given the numbers are getting smaller as ampacity increases. So if you've got really long cable runs you'll probably want to use the 12/2 instead."

When it comes to outdoor, 12v landscape lights, you need to properly size the cable for the circuit.

This is solid copper (the good stuff) 16 gauge cable, so it can handle up to 13 amps (which is about 1,500 watts!) but voltage does drop over distance.

        "B0CSD3GJ53 ★★★★☆ <b>ETL listed, just like regular zip wire but 12 gauge</b> With spring headed our way, we're beginning to plan for some landscaping improvements in our yard, and low-voltage lighting is one of the things I'd like to add, so I picked up this wire. This wire looks like your typical lamp cord/zip wire, but at 12 gauge, this is pretty stout wire. Like zip wire, the two conductors are insulated in black flexible rubber insulation and joined by a thin section of rubber in the middle, so you can easily split the two conductors apart for making any necessary connections. And like typical zip wire, one of the conductors is identified by ribbing on the exterior of the insulation; this conductor is used, by convention, as the neutral wire. I've learned the hard way that before you put any wire into service, check it for breaks. Both conductors in this 100 foot spool passed the continuity test. What else is there to like? They include a chart (see photo) that shows the maximum wattage for any given length and gauge of wire, so it's nice to have that as a handy reference. It's also ETL listed (sort of like UL listed). For low voltage applications like landscape lighting, you could argue that being ETL listed is overkill, but it's a nice thing to have regardless since it is rated for up to 300 volts. One minor nit--I wish that they had length markings on the wire like some wires do--once you start using this, it's nice to be able to know how much length is remaining without having to unspool it and find it's not enough. Again, maybe overkill for a 100' spool but that would have been a really nice touch."

They usually come with a very short pigtail which I extend to take back to a primary distribution cable. This is often fairly long since I like to run the main cable along the back of the planting bed. This cable has a heavy jacket that should withstand some abuse. 22 Gauge isn't very heavy, but my lights are always below 5 watts, so this is plenty heavy. The lighter gauge is easier when splicing multiples together, and its easier to hide. There's nothing special about this wire, but its entirely suitable for the purpose."

I think with this product - go with something that is effective not cheap. Use: Used this for landscaping lights and inserting the 12 AWG wires (connecting pairs) was pretty easy and the connections worked immediately. There is some silicon that oozes out (how else are they supposed to insulate???) and that is fine. I didn't find it to be messy. Water Resistance: To test this truly, I left them out exposed for a couple of months before burying to ensure there is water resistance. Over 12+ days of rain in those 2 months and 3 of them were storms that were windy and rain caused flooding. These things remained good and my landscape lighting worked through and after the rains (and storms!). These work. I would highly recommend these."

Note that anytime you dig underground, you should contact miss-utility. The cable is perfectly fine... the insulation appears high-quality. The cable is of the advertised gauge, verified with a gauge checker. If you run a full 100' length away from your 12-18V power supply, you should expect 1-2 volts of voltage drop at the far end of your cable run. This is normal and not anything wrong with the cable.

        "B0CH2R3XNH ★★★★☆ <b>Copper Clad * ALUMINUM * for maybe 10 amps</b> This product sort of tricked me. I saw 12/2 wire and I’m just so used to everything being copper that I didn’t notice this listing is for CCA (Copper Clad Aluminum). That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but if - like me - you see 12 AWG and have a knee jerk expectation this can carry twenty amps then you’re going to be disappointed. That said, you don’t normally need that kind of amperage in a low voltage system anyway. What tipped me off was measuring the resistance. When I join the two ends of this roll to get a 240-ft loop, I measure 1.0 ohms (after subtracting out 0.1 for my test leads). That’s about double what I’d expect from 12 AWG copper, and puts it more in the neighborhood of 16 AWG copper. So we’re looking at wire here that can carry something in the neighborhood of ten amps — assuming you have enough voltage to even make that happen. This is a consideration that I don’t see mentioned in the product listing at the time of this writing. And that’s probably fine for most garden lighting projects (up to maybe 100W, hopefully not all going down one wire). LED lights these days really don’t use a whole lot of power. So if this product meets your needs then by all means go for it. I see nothing to complain about in terms of build quality and fully expect it to survive direct burial operation. I just want to make sure you’re not under-sizing your wire. And, just to be clear, this wire is for low voltage applications. If you’re looking to carry line voltage without running conduit then you probably want UF-B wire instead and there are rules about how deep you have to bury it (usually one foot at the very least — and that’s assuming you have ground fault protection)."

The Amazon title says “LOW VOLTAGE” but this two conductor wire is labeled SPT-2W, 300 volt, 18AWG Insulation thickness for SPT-2 is .045”. SPT-2 Lamp Cord is commonly used in household appliances. It features two stranded copper conductors and PVC insulation. SPT-2 Lamp Cord is water-resistant, sunlight-resistant, and can withstand severe environmental conditions. SPT-2 Wire also withstands exposure to oil, acids, alkalies, heat, flame, moisture, and chemicals. 18AWG wire amperage rating is: 10 Amps 50 feet, 7 amps 150 feet, 5 amps over 150 feet Having said all that I do actually plan to use this wire for low voltage wiring of 12 VDC LED deck post cap lights.",

The old wiring was sized to handle incandescent bulbs, which I have now replaced with LEDs. That wire was pretty stiff to begin with and has only gotten more so in the 45 years since it put it in. This wire looks like the usual zip cord, it is flexible, the insulation is fairly thick, and resistance measurement shows it to be consistent with 18 awg stranded copper wire. Barring rodent attacks, it should stand up well. It would also be fine for speaker wiring and, because It is actually rated for 300V, you can use as 110V lamp cord. However, be careful to stay within the current rating, which might make it chancy for many appliances. The description says that it is tinned copper; that’s obviously not true but also irrelevant. The price/foot is quite low reasonable so I’d recommend it.",

It's stranded copper to help fight corrosion from the elements. The insulation is much thicker than normal and cable does have a nice weight to it. It does come with a two prong house outlet attachment in case you are replacing a lamp cord as this will also work out nice for that application as well.

I ran 2 40' lengths of this down my driveway to a junction box with my power supply and buried the lines about 14\" down. From the power supply to the breaker I used Romex so don't use it for 110v. Plan on ordering another roll for my son's rgb wires on a 24v system so basically anything below 36v DC this wire is perfect. 14g is thick and I'd probably guess the resistance is similar to 16-18g copper wire.

        "B0CF55452S ★★★★☆ <b>Low voltage landscape copper wire</b> 16/2, 165ft - This is a competent product: labeling on the jacket says direct burial underground, and the insulation is relatively flexible at room temperature for stripping and bending. Stiffer in a colder outdoor environment. I did not measure the length to confirm advertised 165 ft though. Conductor appears to be pure copper strands, which is as claimed, not copper coated aluminum. The individual strands are quite fine. I counted 64 strands after stripping. Makes it very flexible and not likely to break after many and extreme bends. See photo. - Was easy to strip. - Actually the product seems fairly generic: there is no branding printed on the jacket nor any identification label on the roll. But you weren't expecting a mainstream brand anyhow, and it's just outdoor low voltage wire. It's fine. Looks like it will hold up in the garden. - One thing to keep in mind is that because it's bare copper wire (not tined, like marine wire) the connections are subject to corrosion from moisture and humidity. Make sure to use a connector method that either bonds the ends (solder) or creates a waterproof barrier to prevent this. - At the time I ordered the 16/2 165ft roll was $41, making it an okay deal, considering it's generic wire. - Hope this helps",

When it comes to outdoor, 12v landscape lights, you need to properly size the cable for the circuit.

        "B0D2LVRXBC ★★★★★ <b>Just a note</b> Its wire, not much to review, I just wanted to mention a note to other buyers or my future self. No fault to the seller or product, Amazon had the “order this + this + this” option for the end connectors and clamps, which you’ll also need, but it gives you a wrong size for the end clamps. The 3/4” mounting straps are the right size, but 3/4” ends to secure this 6/3 MC cable to your metal boxes is way to big. I ended up having to make a trip to the hardware store to buy smaller 1/2” end clamps instead of the 3/4” ones Amazon was recommending. I love working with MC cable, but its always a pain trying to determine the correct size anti short bushings, end caps, mounting straps etc to go with it. The sizes are all over the place depending on the gauge and number of wires and none of the sellers actually specify what size additional parts are needed to match up with it. As a side note, its also always confusing how sometimes it’ll state (for example) “6/3 wire” where you’d expect it to be three #6 wires total but in reality there are 4 wires, black, red, white and green. There isn’t always consistency in this, sure would be a lot easier if the standard was to count the actual number of wires, including the ground. This 6/3 MC cable in particular is actually four total 6 AWG wires, black, red, white, green for those that aren’t sure. It’s also rated for up to 55 Amps, which is perfect for wiring in a 50 amp RV, Dryer, or Oven outlet. Even if say your dryer outlet only requires 2 hots and a ground (6/2) with no neutral (old style), go ahead and run this (6/3) wire anyhow and just don’t use the extra wire, you’ll be doing yourself a future proof favor for the day when you replace that old appliance and discover the new one requires all 4 wires. Easier, and cheaper to just not use the extra wire now than trying to add another wire later.",

        "B01K4RPB3O ★★★★★ <b>Good quality, high strand-count high flexibility tinned wire with silicone rubber insulation</b> This 22 AWG (gauge) silicone insulated wire is excellent for indoor or protected environments where high flexibility/lack of stiffness, and non-melting (or at least melt resistant) insulation is required. The conductors are a 'high strand count\" type, meaning that instead of being comprised of just a few larger/thicker strands, it is instead comprised of a much greater number of smaller/thinner strands; and this contributes to its lack of stiffness/great flexibility. The other contributing factor to the high flexibility is that the insulation is silicone rubber, rather than the more common PVC (which is rather stiff). This kind of high strand count, silicone rubber insulated wire is exactly what high quality test equipment 'test leads' have been made of for decades. The silicone rubber is also much less heat sensitive than more common insulations such as PVC or \"machine tool wire\". It won't melt off as readily as PVC insulation does if your soldering iron needs to be held onto a joint or terminal for an extended period of time. The fine wire strands are also nicely tinned, and the insulation strips off easily and cleanly, and the stranded wire solders easily. It is a good quality product at an affordable price. HOWEVER, it is not the best choice for many common \"hook up wire\" applications, since its lack of stiffness can be an issue; the strands definitely need to be twisted and soldered in order to keep their shape enough to be formed into a hook before soldering around a terminal for example. This wire also does not want to cooperate if you want to twist a few of them together, because their limpness makes them uncooperative in that regard. And if you use this wire in \"hook up wire\" applications, it wants to just flop into some odd position rather than 'staying put' where you want it to be. Silicone rubber insulation is also not that great when it comes to abrasion resistance, and resistance to some kinds of oils and such where other insulations may be preferable."

I wired my house, exterior and interior, a couple of years ago with this cable. We've been through two winters in the PNW with a couple weeks of snow each time and it has worked great. But now that I know it's CCA, looking back I would have opted for solid copper. I will be wiring another house but will be buying solid copper CAT5e from Home Depot instead because it's for someone else and I'd like to minimize any issues that might arise in the future. Home Depot has both indoor and outdoor bulk CAT5e cable. It's not as expensive as I thought it was going to be at Home Depot. I'm willing to pay a little extra for some peace of mind. Now I'm interested in running LAN speedtests to see what kind of speeds we're actually getting at home. If you end up buying this cable anyways, and specially if installing cable for someone else, I would highly recommend getting a decent cable tester like the ELEGIANT RJ11 RJ45 Cable Tester B01HCQSHNG. I would not recommend this cable for people who use their internet to work from home because it can turn into a troubleshooting nightmare if your internet connection starts dropping occasionally / sporadically. I would only recommend this cable for temporary solutions or people who have spare time to troubleshoot their network if an issue arises and have no problem re-terminating or re-running a wire. p.s. I've loved using 4.5mm saddle brackets B01NBLP9RU + exterior screws + zip ties to tie down cables, specially if running outdoors or more than one cable along the same path. sturdiest setup I've come across."

        "B0CF55452S ★★★★★ <b>Robust stranded copper wire, no skimping on wire gauge</b> Ordered this to use for speaker wiring around the porch and garage, and it does the job just fine. This wire feels like regular lamp cord when working with it. It's easy to cut and strip cleanly, but the jacket is plenty sturdy and should hold up just fine to temperature swings and weather exposure. The PVC jacket does get fairly stiff in the cold, so maybe keep it in the house or put it in the sun before installation so it's easier to run the way you want.",

I like that it's real copper wire that is tinned to help with repelling the corrosion. Use this wire for any DC project where you need 10 gauge wire. This wire will work outdoors or indoors. I plan on using it to make some solar panel extension cables. I will be adding MC4 connectors to the ends. Will work great for my small solar array.",
        "B0BY25MWGN ★★★★★ <b>Tinned for corrosion protection</b> This is a solid pair of good true 16 gauge wire. And it's tinned which I usually select for anything that I'm going to connect outdoors because tinned wire helps protect against corrosion and oxidation if you were only going to be inside in a dry location with your wiring it's not as necessary this and bear copper is just as conductive, but any where you're going to run into higher moisture levels or outdoors. I always pick tinned wire and lugs. Both rolls came out to just over 50 foot in length and they have good insulation on the wires. I'm using these to push 24 V at 5 A almost 50 foot which is still within their rating and no significant voltage drop so these are true 16 gauge.",
        "B0069F4HCW ★★★★★ <b>Bulky SPT-2 Wire</b> This is SPT-2 wire. I would have preferred SPT-1 wire. The insulation barely fits into the recommended fittings. Other than that the cord works fine. I don't downgrade any stars, because they clearly state that the cord is SPT-2. I don't plan to use this outdoors, but the quality seems sufficient for the price. You should also consider that the insulation is (again clearly stated) PVC, so no-one is trying to trick you here. This is just decent cheap cord to get the job done. Edit: Upon further research, it turns out that you cannot get SPT1 cord unless you drop your gauge down to 18 gauge. So, if you are fixed on the concept of using 16 gauge, SPT2 is going to be as thin and flexible as you can get."

        "B01K4RPB3O ★★★★★ <b>Good quality, high strand-count high flexibility tinned wire with silicone rubber insulation</b> This 22 AWG (gauge) silicone insulated wire is excellent for indoor or protected environments where high flexibility/lack of stiffness, and non-melting (or at least melt resistant) insulation is required. The conductors are a 'high strand count\" type, meaning that instead of being comprised of just a few larger/thicker strands, it is instead comprised of a much greater number of smaller/thinner strands; and this contributes to its lack of stiffness/great flexibility. The other contributing factor to the high flexibility is that the insulation is silicone rubber, rather than the more common PVC (which is rather stiff). This kind of high strand count, silicone rubber insulated wire is exactly what high quality test equipment 'test leads' have been made of for decades. The silicone rubber is also much less heat sensitive than more common insulations such as PVC or \"machine tool wire\". It won't melt off as readily as PVC insulation does if your soldering iron needs to be held onto a joint or terminal for an extended period of time. The fine wire strands are also nicely tinned, and the insulation strips off easily and cleanly, and the stranded wire solders easily. It is a good quality product at an affordable price. HOWEVER, it is not the best choice for many common \"hook up wire\" applications, since its lack of stiffness can be an issue; the strands definitely need to be twisted and soldered in order to keep their shape enough to be formed into a hook before soldering around a terminal for example. This wire also does not want to cooperate if you want to twist a few of them together, because their limpness makes them uncooperative in that regard. And if you use this wire in \"hook up wire\" applications, it wants to just flop into some odd position rather than 'staying put' where you want it to be. Silicone rubber insulation is also not that great when it comes to abrasion resistance, and resistance to some kinds of oils and such where other insulations may be preferable."

It has the preferred characteristics of copper (low resistance and flexibility) with the corrosion resistance of tin. I have had to throw away pure copper wire from the 70s since it develops green oxidation and is a pain to clean but have yet to have to clean tinned copper before crimping or soldering. This wire has fewer strands that are larger and a heavy PVC outer coating, compared to the small strand silicon coated wire I use for RC helicopters. This makes it stiffer, easier to route, and tougher. I wouldn't hesitate to walk on this wire or pull it across metal edges that would cut silicon insulation. The larger strands are also better for crimping since smaller strands are more likely to break at the crimp. The only negative is the large outer diameter will limit the number of runs you can have in small spaces. Excellent wire! Recommended!"

The conductors are fine stranded, tinned copper, which is a thin protective coating on the copper to keep it from corroding in harsh environments such as ocean areas, or auto applications where winter road salting can cause problems. Despite what other reviewers have said, this is indeed copper wire, but the “tinning” process makes the wire appear silver unless you look at the cut end. It is typically used with crimp connectors in most applications. There is no indication that this wire is UL listed, so I would not use it for home-wiring applications or any 120 volt (or higher) AC current. The silicone insulation and fine stranding make this wire very flexible, so perfect for sharp turns and pulling through tight locations like behind the dash. The 14 gauge that I used is good for any circuits of up to 10 amps unless they are longer than 25 feet or so. Remember to calculate for both positive and negative lengths, and whether you can afford any voltage drop in your circuit. Circuits for an automotive refrigerator or fog lamps, which have extended use times for example, are different than a circuit for a horn, which is only used for a couple seconds at a time. This seems to be a very good quality and well manufactured wire, and is available in a wide variety of gauges, both red and black."

Needed wire to run through the attic from the LED strips to a controller about 22 feet away. Wanted something heavier than the 22 gauge wire you find everywhere, and I wanted 100 foot spool Those two combinations limited what was out there. Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white). Even with my current strips, would have been nice to be able to upgrade without having to re-run wire. Oh well, happy anyway!"

The silicone insulation is not just about the aesthetic; it’s super flexible and durable, standing up to the wear and tear of regular use. Stripping the wires is often a hassle with other kits, but with this one, it’s effortless, saving time and frustration. In terms of performance, these wires have been reliable in all my applications, especially in internal wiring where quality cannot be compromised. Their flexibility allows for easy routing through tight spaces without compromising the integrity of the wire. While there are cheaper options out there, this kit proves that you get what you pay for. It’s a fantastic investment for anyone from hobbyists to professional electricians. If you’re looking for high-quality, flexible, and easy-to-use wires, look no further than this 18-gauge wire kit."

        "B07TFF9FTM ★★★★★ <b>Ultra flexible wire, 200C, great value!</b> Very happy with this wire set -- great value, and it's what the listing says it is. Be sure you know what you're buying. This is ultra flexible, with many super-fine strands and silicone rubber insulation marked 200C (higher than PVC but lower than PTFE). The fine strands (150 of them, but I didn't count!) can be a bit of a challenge when crimping contacts... make sure no microscopic strands escape the crimp -- then it works great. The insulation is thick but soft: very easy to work with but also easily damaged if used in the wrong application. It's the right cable for routing in tight locations, since it's so willing to bend and lay flat... good for DIY drones (flexing arms or retracting legs) or making wiring harnesses that need to flex but are well protected from abrasion and pinching. For more rugged high-temp insulation, consider PTFE but it is much more difficult to work with and hard to find at a reasonable price. As noted by others, some colors are a bit off. Red is clearly orange, and blue is gray-purple. That's okay for my purposes, but maybe not if you are building to a print for assemblies that will be inspected. The velcro wraps keep each spool neat, and the box is good for organizing these spools when lots of other wire spools are around."

I've ran 14-ga wire many times, and this wire is the correct thickness solid-core, and came in the correct length, BUT, this roll was bit brittle. I had one section that required a 90-deg bend under my deck... the neutral wire broke inside the sheathing, which caused me to have to trash that section and re-run it with a different brand/manufacturer wire I had. I wasn't happy about the break, but the rest of the roll was able to be used elsewhere in the build to wire low-amp/load LED dusk-to-dawn coach-lamps on each side of my garage doors (so none was really wasted). Maybe the break was just a factory-defect? Still, though, I will not likely buy this brand of 14-ga wire again, unless it is all that is available."

The only difference I really noticed was the outer jacket of the Romex felt more slick or slippery to the Arizona wire. It might matter a little bit if you are trying to pull it through 10 studs at once or so, but I don't think it would be a big difference. Overall, this wire seems to be right in line with the Romex. At the moment, this 100 ft roll is cheaper by about $20 than the 100 ft of Romex.

The lights are powered by a low voltage cable under the walkways. Last Winter a mother fox made a temporary den for her cubs under one of the boardwalks. In the Spring we discovered that several of the marker lights wouldn't light up due to power cables that were chewed through by sharp little teeth. The foxes have moved on but we were faced with repairing the broken cable. That's why I got this cable. It's perfect for low voltage outdoor use. The outside jacket is thick and robust. It took a bit of careful cutting to strip it off without damaging the inside conductor wires. Once off, I noticed this isn't just a standard single channel insulator jacket. It actually has two channels -- one for each of the conductors. (See photo.) That's makes for very tightly insulated conductors that should provide enhanced protection in underground or very wet environments. When I stripped the two conductors, I noticed they are not tinned as stated in the product description. This may or may not be an issue for you. Tinned copper cable is easier to solder and also minimizes corrosion for non-soldered joints. I removed a star from an otherwise five star review due to this. Summary Comments If you don't need tinned copper cable for low voltage outdoor applications, this is a good choice. The insulation is robust and should hold up well in underground or wet environments. You get pure copper conductors that provide efficient electrical conductivity."

This multi carrier wire is professional grade and thick enough to include DC power and ground at any amperage across long runs. Solid copper is the best but basically impossible to use for most conditions. The next best option and most versatile is thick, multi strand copper, which is what this is. Thick enough for power and ground but thin enough to run in tight spaces and make turns. I've already used most of this roll on butt connectors, soldered joints and distribution blocks and the pvc insulation is strong enough for direct burial on low voltage landscape lighting. You can even use this for running a set of quality surround speakers to the other side of a room. Very good wire with a wide range of applications and even better price point.

        "B09V56LTY5 ★★★★☆ <b>Good for repairing outdoor marker light cables, robust insulation, pure copper wire - not tinned</b> We have an extensive series of outdoor stairs and boardwalks that are lighted by LED marker lights every ten feet. The lights are powered by a low voltage cable under the walkways. Last Winter a mother fox made a temporary den for her cubs under one of the boardwalks. In the Spring we discovered that several of the marker lights wouldn't light up due to power cables that were chewed through by sharp little teeth. The foxes have moved on but we were faced with repairing the broken cable. That's why I got this cable. It's perfect for low voltage outdoor use. The outside jacket is thick and robust. It took a bit of careful cutting to strip it off without damaging the inside conductor wires. Once off, I noticed this isn't just a standard single channel insulator jacket. It actually has two channels -- one for each of the conductors. (See photo.) That's makes for very tightly insulated conductors that should provide enhanced protection in underground or very wet environments. When I stripped the two conductors, I noticed they are not tinned as stated in the product description. This may or may not be an issue for you. Tinned copper cable is easier to solder and also minimizes corrosion for non-soldered joints. I removed a star from an otherwise five star review due to this. Summary Comments If you don't need tinned copper cable for low voltage outdoor applications, this is a good choice. The insulation is robust and should hold up well in underground or wet environments. You get pure copper conductors that provide efficient electrical conductivity."

I ran liquid tight conduit from the panel to the firepit, it's unnecessary as this cable is made for direct burial, however I wanted the added protection as it's near our pool plumbing and wiring, and also wanted the option to pull additional wire if necessary. I ran the conduit from underground up the side of the posts, since they are backfilled with concrete I wanted the ability to pull wire through if something needed to be replaced rather than having the wire itself ran through the concrete and up the post.

        "B0CSD35PQT ★★★★☆ <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone."

When I open a gate the electric fence can stay energized around the entire property without breaking the connection. Those spring loaded handles you use to break the wire and open a gate often rust out and fail. I will still use these to energize the gate itself but now I know the rest of the property is energized while I come and go.

However it is outdoor rated for UV exposure only. Because there is so much empty space within the outer jacket, anyone wanting to use this outdoors in damp climates or around water (irrigation wiring, landscape lighting, etc) should realize that the outer jacket is going to rapidly fill up with water (and stay filled), causing several types of issues: - Electric issues: any minor wire scrapes or damage could result in hard-to-trace shorts or random voltage drops. - Extra water weight: The extra weight all of that water filling up the PVC jacket could be significant. I intended to use this cable for outdoor permanent installations of LED light strings, hung or mounted in various ways on my house and in landscaping. I live in a wet climate, and after a few months of rainy fall/winter/spring weather I estimate that the added weight of all that water filling up the empty space within the cable jacket would more than double the total weight of the cable runs. With a couple hundred feet of cable, that weight will add up pretty quickly. - Water damage: Depending on how/where your cabling is routed, you could essentially be installing a de-facto water pipe that will shunt rain and/or irrigation water through the excess space within the outer jacket and into areas of your walls/house that would otherwise have remained perfectly dry.

Don't bother with CCA (copper clad aluminum) wire because not only do the strands break very easily, it does not hold up very well when exposed to moisture because it corrodes very quickly.

        "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Great for DIYers and reasonably priced for copper with silicone insulation</b> The price for copper wire has gone up so dramatically in the last few years, I did a lot of rewiring in my house a few years back and a spool of 12/2 1000 feet Romex was $260 and now over $500 a roll at Lowes or HomeDepot. The prices for these spools are cheaper than similar PVC coated wires at Walmart for 20 gauge wire and these have more expensive silicone coating and tinned copper. Price wise these are very good wires and good for small projects or repairs on electronics. The wire is very flexible and good for replacing cheaper wires in outdoor equipment that are subject to the elements or chemicals. The silicone is good for almost degrees 400F which is great for power and heating equipment as they are more chemical resistant and won't melt as easily. I have two outdoor portable water heaters used for camping and the wiring on the units use the cheaper PVC and the insulation can melt when the heaters are used for extended periods. I have had to wrap the wires in aluminum heat wrap to protect the PVC cables now I can repair them with the silicone wires without having to wrap them with protective aluminum heat shields."

        "B0C4GXNNBD ★★★★★ <b>Solid tough jacket and super flexible 18 gauge wire at only $0.46 per foot!</b> This is a solid heavy duty jacket wire that is also super flexible and soft, great for any outdoor/automotive applications! It is ironically rated at 80℃ 300V and then listed as low voltage wire. Which one is it? There is nothing low at 300V! We actually used it to run outdoor backyard lights and it was so easy to work with this wire, very moldable and elastic in tight corners and easy to get any angle needed out of it. However, with a 100 feet roll there is a lot this wire an be used at. Planing on using it on the bike to wire some accessory lights with a switch as it is very well protected wire and would work great on a bike!"

        "B09V56LTY5 ★★★★★ <b>Holds up well in the sheathing</b> This wire has been sitting outside all summer for me to run from a solar charged pump controller to the sensors for water tank levels. It hasn't had any issue even when the deer seem to be doing their best to trample and knock over all the other parts of my system. Inside the black sheath even the comparatively small 16 gauge wire holds up very well. It was all easy to strip and get connected. Beyond that it's just wire; it holds together and delivers the signal. 10M is also a nice feature where you can get a decent length without having to buy in bulk."

        "B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ <b>Good Set for DIYer and Makers</b> Good set of 20AWG silicon wires with the most common colors. Perfect for various projects. Although there's no specific mention of an automotive rating, the copper strands and silicon insulation should make them suitable for automotive use. I recently used them for an outdoor project, and I'm really impressed. No worries about their performance—they're reliable and easy to work with and route. Hope this helps with your decision. Pros: Good selection of common colors Suitable for various projects Copper strands and silicon insulation offer reliability Easy to work with and route",
        "B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ <b>Thick jacket</b> If you think of a classic hand power tool cord with about a 1/4\" diameter power cable, this matches that - although it is only two wires, so not the right choice for that purpose. Just fine for outdoor speakers and other projects where a little extra protection on the wire is important. Takes a little skill to strip due to the jacket thickness; that's a good thing.",
        "B07GH7JHG9 ★★★★★ <b>Good quality and excellent price</b> It is good for what I need it for, outside exposed to the elements this is a good choice",

        "B0C9D4VCK7 ★★★★★ <b>Used for power to my sprinkler controller/valves...</b> This 2-conductor 18 AWG cable should work out well for my use... getting 24VAC out to my sprinkler controller from the power transformer and out to my array of sprinkler valves. The outer PVC jacket is durable and thick although I found it more difficult to strip the jacket to access the inner conductors than standard jacketed cable. The pair of conductors stripped easily and the exposed copper conductors were easy to to twist the strands and then connect to their mating wires. Since part of the cable run is exposed to the elements, we shall see how the outer jacker holds up to the sun's UV rays during the summer months and snow and sub-zero temperatures in winter. This wire gets my seal of approval and a 5 star review.",
        "B0C84BL61V ★★★★★ <b>Great quality</b> Very nice quality super flexible silicone wire. Nice feel insulation and very flexible wires. Great for outdoor or marine use. Great value for what you get.",

        "B0CR9RQTNL ★★★★★ <b>Great wire</b> Easy to use. I used it for landscape lights and for outdoor speakers. Great quality, easy to strip, holds tight in wire nuts. 👍👍",
        "B07FYWHM3L ★★★★★ <b>Works perfectly</b> Took me 5 minutes to do it. Worked perfectly. Diagram in back on package is all you need to know. You will need some wire nuts at sprinkler box (1) and 3 outdoor wire caps (or wire nuts if you don’t care).",
        "B073593MHW ★★★★★ <b>Great wire</b> This worked perfectly for my outdoor firepit area. We have a subpanel outside for our pool equipment, so it was easy to trench from that panel over to our firepit. I added 3 couple outlets, one for our string lights (that one is mounted up high on the post to the left) and the other two for people who may want to charge their phone, plug in a heated blanket, etc. It's easy to run the wire now but would be a pain to add later once rock is added to the inside of the pit, so I tried to think ahead as much as possible. I ran liquid tight conduit from the panel to the firepit, it's unnecessary as this cable is made for direct burial, however I wanted the added protection as it's near our pool plumbing and wiring, and also wanted the option to pull additional wire if necessary. I ran the conduit from underground up the side of the posts, since they are backfilled with concrete I wanted the ability to pull wire through if something needed to be replaced rather than having the wire itself ran through the concrete and up the post. I used the Ideal wire strippers to remove the sheathing and also strip the conductor wires, worked great and worth the money.",
        "B07GH7JHG9 ★★★★★ <b>Works for what I needed. I have it buried, run along walls and under our deck.</b> I recently finished up installing a bunch of security cameras around the house, most being POE. I used this cable to run wire to our shed (90 feet under a deck, 18 feet underground), a small storage building (75 feet under the deck), and to our office from the garage - that one was through a wall in the garage where the cable company installed the modem, along 80 feet of outside wall, through another wall and into the office. No complaints. Worked with the CAT-5 and CAT-6 pass-through connectors I use.",

        "B0CPPWBGT8 ★★★★★ <b>Great quality for outdoor use.</b> I bought it to wire LED lighting. Superior quality, easy to use. Genuine copper. Will order more for a backyard project.",
        "B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ <b>Excellent hook-up wire for outdoor and automotive projects.</b> This is good wire for low voltage projects around your house, barn, and garage. The outer sheath is very rugged and abrasion resistant and yet it strips easily so that you're not fighting with it, as you'll do with other types of two-conductor and sheathed wires. The two inner conductors will handle a modest amount of amperage such as for wiring up lights and similar electrical devices. Further, the inner conductors take solder well, but I'd advise that you use some flux to ensure that the solder adequately infiltrates between the wire strands.",
        "B0CF55452S ★★★★★ <b>The good stuff!</b> Best part about this cabling is it's easy to pull apart the two strands without the wire stripping down to the copper internals. Some cables, when pulled apart, will actually rip far enough apart to expose the underlying copper strands, which requires redoing the split or patching the cable. This landscape wire is definitely not cheap, and does not split. I've used about half of it to run a few dozen lights around my house. Used with multiple LED spotlights and outdoor floods. Used on burial as well as wired along fences exposed to the elements. It's been a few months and zero issues thus far. Get it!",
        "B0BPLQ3PWN ★★★★★ <b>good value for a lot of wire</b> ordered this wire for a cabinet lighting project I had. Jacket material is pliable, strips easily and has a good thickness to it. My project is indoors, but it looks and feels like nice all-purpose 18awg duplex wire - suitable for all kinds of projects. Rated for outdoor use, but I am not using it that way so can't comment on longevity in the weather. I found it to be a great value!",
        "B000WNA5WS ★★★★★ <b>Wire for outside post light.</b> Good product.",
        "B07GH7JHG9 ★★★★★ <b>Good outdoor wire for the money.</b> The wire does not kick up when being pulled long distances. It is easy to work with when terminating. I’ll buy this again. (No idea what stretch and thickness have to do with this wire!) Wire won’t stretch and it is the thickness of outdoor Ethernet cable!",
        "B01M22ZU7X ★★★★★ <b>Great for LED/RGB runs</b> Perfect product for outdoor LED/RGB lighting. Zero issues whatsoever with the 700 feet I’ve used and installed thus far. Power, ground, and data with no problems.",
        "B07GD8WL5V ★★★★★ <b>Works</b> Works used for my retaining wall. Real easy",
        "B0CSD3KPX3 ★★★★★ <b>Reliable and Easy-to-Install Landscape Wire</b> This Low Voltage Landscape Wire is a high-quality and versatile solution for all your landscape lighting needs, offering ease of installation and exceptional performance. Right out of the box, I was impressed by the quality of the wire. The 16-gauge low voltage stranded copper wire is durable and sturdy, ensuring reliable performance in outdoor environments. Additionally, the wire is easy to strip, making installation a breeze even for those with limited experience. One of the standout features of this landscape wire is its compatibility with low voltage connectors. Whether you're connecting lights, transformers, or other landscape lighting fixtures, the wire works seamlessly with a variety of connectors, providing a secure and reliable connection every time. The wiring has a raised line indicating the difference in +ve or -ve side so to say, this is only for installation purposes to guide you. Furthermore, the wire can be directly buried in the ground without the need for conduit, adding to its versatility and ease of installation. This makes it perfect for a wide range of outdoor lighting applications, from garden pathways to backyard landscapes.",
        "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>It’s easy to work with and yet sturdy.</b> I used this to bury hot wire under a gate and to run along the back of a barn. It worked satisfactorily and i would purchase again if the need arises. The cost is reasonable.",
        "B0CP48T2SJ ★★★★★ <b>Tough Quality Wire</b> Only downside of this is it is pretty pricey... but at least you do get what you pay for. The outer coating is tough material. Once getting it stripped away, the 2 main leads seem to be of high quality. Everything seems very flexible even in cold temps, and seems to hold up well so far in sunlight. Been out for almost a year on a grain auger and it still has its full properties.",
        "B0C65LQYPP ★★★★☆ <b>Cabling is decent quality and mostly as described</b> This cabling is decent quality and it is mostly as pictured and described in the product listing. The one minus with this is that it is described as direct burial. Based on what I see, this is not suitable for burial. Weather resistant and good for outdoor use, yes, this looks great for that usage. Other comments have already stated as much, with the current top comment going into a lot of excellent detail.",
        "B01M62HEPU ★★★★★ <b>nice flexable</b> used this on a pontoon for adding LED lights and a mast light on a sailboat, seems like nice cable, just ordered one more roll so I'll have this on hand for my next project.",
        "B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ <b>Good outdoor cable</b> This heavily insulated wire is great for other uses - lie outdoor cameras, landscape lighting, or fountains.",
        "B0B1CVFG6N ★★★★★ <b>Good ole 12/2 wire</b> I used the wire to install nearly 50 yard lights between my front and back yard and they are working perfectly a year later. I buried the wire and used waterproof connectors and wrapped with electrical tape for an added protection.",

The outer sheath is very rugged and abrasion resistant and yet it strips easily so that you're not fighting with it, as you'll do with other types of two-conductor and sheathed wires. The two inner conductors will handle a modest amount of amperage such as for wiring up lights and similar electrical devices. Further, the inner conductors take solder well, but I'd advise that you use some flux to ensure that the solder adequately infiltrates between the wire strands.",

        "B0C9H1G52F ★★★★★ <b>Works well - Good value</b> All copper products have gotten to noise-bleed pricing of late. Even running low voltage wire is just ridiculously expensive especially if you run to one of the home stores. Ad frankly , if you're ordering wire without knowing what it is or seeing/feeling it, it can be a little scary as the quality varies so much. This wire arrives on a wooden core. Okay - that makes 500ft of heavy a little heavier, but you know they care about their product. It's also probably the only way to ship it so it doesn't end up as a bundle of knotted wire when it arrives in your standard Amazon box which in my case was shipped through UPS and clearly had a tough ride. But 500 feet of wire is pretty heavy at about 22 lbs on a 10x10-ish core. And the wire made it fine with a nice sheet of cardboard wrapped around the wire in between the core ends. The box clearly won over whichever UPS employee was fighting with it. The wire just feels like quality. It''s a firm, yet flexible outer sheath holding the two separate strands of 16 gauge wire. The sheath is UV resistant and rated for direct burial. It's UL listed and RoHS rated. It seems like a quality product and for purposes it's great. My use case is extending an existing low voltage run along the side of the property of the house to the back and introducing low voltage lights to the back yard. In southern Florida, the groundwater is high, the weather humid, and the sun hot. What better test ground for this? Anyhow it's ultimately gonna be buried under landscape rocks yet above landscape fabric in most places. Others will be direct burial In certain spots known for puddling. I expect no issues given the quality of this wire. And at 16Awg I expect it to be able to carry the 12 volts I need without concern. Highly recommend."

Ges very happy with this product n planes to use more in the future!"

I got out some Southwire Romex and compared the two. This Arizona branded wire was nearly identical. The outer jacket was cut and pulled back and the wire stripped just as easily as the Romex. The only difference I really noticed was the outer jacket of the Romex felt more slick or slippery to the Arizona wire. It might matter a little bit if you are trying to pull it through 10 studs at once or so, but I don't think it would be a big difference. Overall, this wire seems to be right in line with the Romex. At the moment, this 100 ft roll is cheaper by about $20 than the 100 ft of Romex. I will say if you can bump up to the 250 ft roll, that is usually the best deal, but sometimes that is just overkill for your project and a smaller roll works out better. I would certainly have no issues using this wire for adding some lights or outlets and might use it to wire up my shed soon.",
        "B09CG2S2P2 ★★★★☆ <b>Great Lightweight Wire</b> This Cablectric 4 Roll 12 Gauge Copper Clad Aluminum Primary Wire came in four bright colors. It is lightweight and doesn't qualify for use as the wiring in a house and isn't rated to be used outdoors. I wonder why they say it is good for marine usage if it can't be used outdoors. All I can figure is it may be used if concealed from the weather, such as under the sides of a boat or inside a houseboat. It wouldn't be acceptable for a boat trailer, however, as the wires are exposed to the elements there. We chose to use the wire for the new speaker system for our television. My adult son and I live together and he wired the speakers. He said it was very easy with this wire as it stripped easily and didn't break any when he wrapped the ends around the terminals. I have to take his word for this as I certainly don't know anything about it!! Next, he plans to rewire the LED lights under our countertops. They don't carry enough current to count as house wiring. All in all, this is great wire for general use. It is nice to have available for things that may pop up. Who knows, I may have a need for some brightly colored wire for a craft project, too!! At this writing, it is only about $30 for 100 feet of wire, so it is very reasonable. I do recommend it!!",

After putting ends on and hooking up devices on either end. I had no internet connection. Only a periodic handshake between devices. I'm thinking maybe I had messed up making the ends. So I reterminate ends and same problem. Luckily I had 200 feet on one end extra and 100 feet on the other. So I trimmed off 300 feet and now I have a connection and everything is working. However, The connection has slight instability and drops and comes back up again. So, do not buy. Pay the extra money for the good stuff.

After I screwed each one on, though, I picked up some dirt and rubbed it in to my hands; that worked fine to remove the stickiness, and washed off later with no problem. I kind of think that I could have saved some money by using regular wire nuts and just squirting silicone caulk in it before screwing in the wire, but I'm not positive it would have been the same.

It seems to be working well, but I'll need to come back in a year or so, to see how it's holing up. One thing I did notice is that the outer insulation is VERY thick. I suppose this is good and bad. (Probably mostly good.) What's bad is that it was too thick to work with my standard wire stripping took, so I needed to remove the outer insulation by hand, using a razor blade. The thickness of the insulation, and the fact that it's not a uniform thickness all around (see photo), made it hard to cut off the outer insulation without nicking the inner insulation on the individual conductors. The GOOD aspect is that the extra-thick outer insulation will likely protect the conductors from being crushed or otherwise damaged during use. (An extra-thick outer layer of insulation could come in especially handy for outdoor buried applications, to protect against a spade or small shovel , for example, when planting flowers.) So far, I am pleased with this product!",

I installed glass lights in the ground and the wire is very easy to connect the vampire clips to and get a good connection. It is flexible enough to go around bushes and boulders if needed. When it comes to slicing into the wire to make the connection, it’s very easy to use just a simple razor blade and get the wires spread apart. My recommendation is to lay out all of the wiring and the lights above ground make all of your connections and taps into the wire, and then make sure everything is working before you start to bury the cable and the lights. All in all very simple wire to use and I would recommended it for any landscape project."

Stiffer in a colder outdoor environment. I did not measure the length to confirm advertised 165 ft though. Conductor appears to be pure copper strands, which is as claimed, not copper coated aluminum. The individual strands are quite fine. I counted 64 strands after stripping.

But you weren't expecting a mainstream brand anyhow, and it's just outdoor low voltage wire. It's fine. Looks like it will hold up in the garden. - One thing to keep in mind is that because it's bare copper wire (not tined, like marine wire) the connections are subject to corrosion from moisture and humidity. Make sure to use a connector method that either bonds the ends (solder) or creates a waterproof barrier to prevent this. - At the time I ordered the 16/2 165ft roll was $41, making it an okay deal, considering it's generic wire. - Hope this helps",

Even running low voltage wire is just ridiculously expensive especially if you run to one of the home stores. Ad frankly , if you're ordering wire without knowing what it is or seeing/feeling it, it can be a little scary as the quality varies so much. This wire arrives on a wooden core. Okay - that makes 500ft of heavy a little heavier, but you know they care about their product. It's also probably the only way to ship it so it doesn't end up as a bundle of knotted wire when it arrives in your standard Amazon box which in my case was shipped through UPS and clearly had a tough ride. But 500 feet of wire is pretty heavy at about 22 lbs on a 10x10-ish core. And the wire made it fine with a nice sheet of cardboard wrapped around the wire in between the core ends. The box clearly won over whichever UPS employee was fighting with it. The wire just feels like quality. It''s a firm, yet flexible outer sheath holding the two separate strands of 16 gauge wire. The sheath is UV resistant and rated for direct burial. It's UL listed and RoHS rated. It seems like a quality product and for purposes it's great. My use case is extending an existing low voltage run along the side of the property of the house to the back and introducing low voltage lights to the back yard. In southern Florida, the groundwater is high, the weather humid, and the sun hot. What better test ground for this? Anyhow it's ultimately gonna be buried under landscape rocks yet above landscape fabric in most places. Others will be direct burial In certain spots known for puddling.

The cable is of the advertised gauge, verified with a gauge checker.

This is solid copper (the good stuff) 16 gauge cable, so it can handle up to 13 amps (which is about 1,500 watts!) but voltage does drop over distance. So this could easily handle one of the outdoor lighting kits or if you just want to add some more lights. (Old style, incandescent lights are a different story) 100% pure copper, direct burial, can't get much better than that, especially at this price",

I did a small meter test to make sure there was no break any where in the middle of what I needed and got it installed worked like a charm. The wire is insulated with an out PVC layer I wouldn't recommend leaving it out into the elements for extended periods of time as you know what sun and heat can do to anything electric. I would use this cable for in wall projects and maybe to bury in the dirt to hide away but I'm also a fan of use a conduit whether it's PVC piping or the flexible plastic tubing with a split in it to stick cables in easily. Overall the cable is tough and didn't lose signal in any of my projects by far and for the sake of it I used it on speakers and they worked with now sound quality loss. Don't quote me on that as I did not have the right equipment to measur e sound all my test were through human observation.",

        "B073593MHW ★★★★★ <b>Great wire</b> This worked perfectly for my outdoor firepit area. We have a subpanel outside for our pool equipment, so it was easy to trench from that panel over to our firepit. I added 3 couple outlets, one for our string lights (that one is mounted up high on the post to the left) and the other two for people who may want to charge their phone, plug in a heated blanket, etc. It's easy to run the wire now but would be a pain to add later once rock is added to the inside of the pit, so I tried to think ahead as much as possible. I ran liquid tight conduit from the panel to the firepit, it's unnecessary as this cable is made for direct burial, however I wanted the added protection as it's near our pool plumbing and wiring, and also wanted the option to pull additional wire if necessary. I ran the conduit from underground up the side of the posts, since they are backfilled with concrete I wanted the ability to pull wire through if something needed to be replaced rather than having the wire itself ran through the concrete and up the post. I used the Ideal wire strippers to remove the sheathing and also strip the conductor wires, worked great and worth the money.",

        "B07Y7S1BRN ★★★★★ <b>Illuminate Your Landscape: Quality Wire for a Brilliant Outdoor Experience.</b> In the realm of outdoor landscaping projects, the quality of materials is paramount. And in our recent endeavor, the direct burial landscape light wire we procured became a star player. Boasting robust construction, it met our criteria both in terms of price and performance. The industrial-grade PVC insulation is a testament to its durability, ensuring longevity even in demanding outdoor conditions. As a 2-wire product, it further simplifies installations. A thoughtful touch is the distinctive design of each wire: one side is smoothly finished, while the other bears grooves, making identification a breeze during setup. However, there's one aspect where the product could be enhanced — its packaging. The wire is sheathed entirely in plastic, and accessing it requires completely removing this protective cover. This might sound like a minor quibble, but when you're deep into the intricacies of landscaping, unwrapping the wire can become a tangled chore, leading to unintended project delays. In conclusion, the landscape light wire has much going for it, and I'd consider repurchasing it for future projects. But a packaging redesign is to facilitate easier unspooling and more convenient storage."

This is copper wire, NOT CCA wire (copper coated aluminum). Each lead, red and black have a substantial insulating cover. In addition, both leads/wires are surrounded by another insulation layer that binds everything together. The finished product is round and smooth. This is designed as a direct burial wire. That means it can be used outside, including in the dirt just as it is. However, remember to make all connections perfectly watertight. Part of my project will have the wire exposed to direct sunlight. So I feel certain it will hold up for a long time.

The exterior coating is thick and it has an additional plastic layer + a plastic separator. It’s “exterior” for about 3” of wire on this run but I’m also going to run it direct-burial to my generator and I have confidence it will hold up. It fit standard Cat6 ends (barely). Standard tension guards also fit on the wire but once again, barely. My gripe is that there are defects on the individual wire sheathing (mostly green stripe). It’s bubbled and extra thick in places so if you accidentally find a piece like that, you lose 1 inch to 1 foot recutting the wire until you find an inch or two that will push into the connector. I can’t find this wire in black locally so I’m not complaining too much but be aware it’s frustrating and probably not what you want for your 10Gbps network. I’m using it to power/connect an exterior POE Wi-Fi AP and connect a generac generator and I’m confident that it will provide solid stable low-bandwidth connections."

        "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>Works great for farm use</b> The RiteFENCE Electric Fence Double Insulated Underground Hard Cable is working perfectly for use 'underneath' my 12' and 16' foot double gates that lead to my pasture. For years I have used a system where I disconnect my electric fence by hand to open my gates without getting shocked. I dug a small trench about 6\" deep under a couple of my gates and buried the RiteFENCE, and left each end protrude out of the ground about two feet to connect to one of the lower existing fence wires so as not to disconnect the continuous circuit at any time when opening gates now. I chose the 6\" depth to bury the heavily insulated RiteFENCE since in addition to moving livestock through the gates, I also drive vehicles and farm implements through the gates as well. The RiteFENCE is very sturdy and rigid, and the 12-½ gauge took some time to straighten out to fit flat and neatly into the trenches I dug and placed the wire into, but this is a definite plus for electric fence wire to be used on a farm or ranch. The RiteFENCE doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and has a thick outer coating with the inner wire apparently coated as well for the 'double insulation' aspect. When installing, I also cut back a couple of inches of the RiteFENCE on each end and used a heavy duty crimp connection to the barb wire fencing I use. Once crimped, I neatly wrapped the connections with quality electrical tape to seal from the elements. The RiteFENCE is going to be ideal for many other underground connection needs I have around the farm. I would highly recommend any farmers and ranchers who run electric fence to give the RiteFENCE a try if you want to eliminate the risk of a nasty shock, especially with the higher powered fence chargers. The price point seems very fair and in fact is actually a little cheaper than what I saw at my local farm supply store. Highly recommend!"

It's low-voltage, direct burial landscape wire, which means you can install it underground and at a relatively shallow depth. I'd suggest somewhere around 4\" deep. Note that anytime you dig underground, you should contact miss-utility. The cable is perfectly fine... the insulation appears high-quality. The cable is of the advertised gauge, verified with a gauge checker. If you run a full 100' length away from your 12-18V power supply, you should expect 1-2 volts of voltage drop at the far end of your cable run. This is normal and not anything wrong with the cable.

The PVC insulation is tough and will stand up to abrasion. This cable should not be used for line voltage applications as the insulation is not rated for that application. I use 14/2 cable in my landscape lighting for the final connections to groups of LED fixtures. I use 12/2 for distribution over long distances to get to the clusters of fixtures. 14/2 works great in that application and helps to save a little money compared to running 12/2 everywhere. If your cable runs are all short and you have a modest number of LED fixtures then 14/2 may be good enough for the entire system. Note that 14/2 cable has a lower current rating than 12/2 cable, which is counterintuitive given the numbers are getting smaller as ampacity increases. So if you've got really long cable runs you'll probably want to use the 12/2 instead."

        "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>Works great for farm use</b> The RiteFENCE Electric Fence Double Insulated Underground Hard Cable is working perfectly for use 'underneath' my 12' and 16' foot double gates that lead to my pasture. For years I have used a system where I disconnect my electric fence by hand to open my gates without getting shocked. I dug a small trench about 6\" deep under a couple of my gates and buried the RiteFENCE, and left each end protrude out of the ground about two feet to connect to one of the lower existing fence wires so as not to disconnect the continuous circuit at any time when opening gates now. I chose the 6\" depth to bury the heavily insulated RiteFENCE since in addition to moving livestock through the gates, I also drive vehicles and farm implements through the gates as well. The RiteFENCE is very sturdy and rigid, and the 12-½ gauge took some time to straighten out to fit flat and neatly into the trenches I dug and placed the wire into, but this is a definite plus for electric fence wire to be used on a farm or ranch. The RiteFENCE doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and has a thick outer coating with the inner wire apparently coated as well for the 'double insulation' aspect. When installing, I also cut back a couple of inches of the RiteFENCE on each end and used a heavy duty crimp connection to the barb wire fencing I use. Once crimped, I neatly wrapped the connections with quality electrical tape to seal from the elements. The RiteFENCE is going to be ideal for many other underground connection needs I have around the farm. I would highly recommend any farmers and ranchers who run electric fence to give the RiteFENCE a try if you want to eliminate the risk of a nasty shock, especially with the higher powered fence chargers. The price point seems very fair and in fact is actually a little cheaper than what I saw at my local farm supply store. Highly recommend!",

In summary the product as described is very misleading, clearly shown is on the image is copper wires (In reality it is copper clad aluminum). I read \"Multiple Reviews\" on the lower scored Amazon reviews of the Copper Clad Aluminum wiring turning to dust or cannot be soldered. The conductivity rating from NEC {National Electrical Code} for 14 GA Aluminum wire is null \"not rated\"). NEC code only starts at 12 gauge, however it does not address Copper Clad Aluminum. This Copper Clad Aluminum from the unwrapped spool, appears to be of high quality, However I am returning it for misleading advertising and the concerns with galvanic corrosion when terminating this wiring to anything but connectors certified to accept aluminum (Yes it copper clad, I am being conservative). I am concerned with persons purchasing this product thinking it is copper (look at as advertised picture). 14 GA copper is rated for 15 amps (My best guess for this wiring is 3A, After severe derating).

If you run even a cheap breakout toolhead and deck pcb with a common ground you can add in the 5 BL probe wires into it and only have your servo cable and heater wires separate in the sleeving, which they should be anyways due to size/current differences. All this in a 6mm or so package. I did tidy wiring before but could never get all the wires to less than 11-12mm and they were always lumpy and didn't flex well binding up my toolhead on certain movements. This will help me get it down to less than 10mm diameter in total. If i upgrade to a board system i'll definitely come back to see if there's a cable with the proper number i need to keep all the low voltage in one. Only thing that would make this perfect is to have multi gauges in it but that's custom cabling and i don't need 50,000 ft of it."

        "B0BGS5GRSK ★★★★★ <b>Reliable and Versatile</b> I recently purchased the 18 Gauge Wire 2 Conductor Electrical Wire for my automotive and lighting projects, and I am extremely satisfied with its performance. This wire is perfect for low voltage applications, such as automotive wiring, LED strips, lamp lighting, and marine projects. Therefore, I am giving it a five-star rating. The wire is made of high-quality 18 AWG stranded PVC cord, which provides excellent flexibility and durability. I have found that this flexibility makes it easy to route the wire in tight spaces and around corners without any issues. Additionally, the stranded construction ensures that the wire is resistant to breakage and can withstand the rigors of demanding applications. The tinned copper conductors are another great feature of this wire. The tinning process adds a layer of protection to the copper, making it more resistant to corrosion and extending the lifespan of the wire. This is particularly important for marine applications, where exposure to moisture and saltwater can be a concern. The 18/2 wire configuration, with two conductors, is suitable for a wide range of electrical projects. It allows for easy connection of various components, such as LED strips, lamps, switches, and more. The wire is color-coded, with one conductor in red and the other in black, making it simple to identify and connect the positive and negative terminals correctly. The length of the wire, 100ft (30.48m), provides ample supply for most projects, allowing for flexibility in routing and installation. The wire is neatly packaged and easy to handle, without any tangles or kinks. I have used this wire extensively in my automotive projects, and it has performed flawlessly. The low voltage rating of 12V ensures safe and reliable operation without any risk of electrical hazards. The wire's insulation is of high quality and provides excellent protection against short circuits and electrical interference. Overall, the 18 Gauge Wire 2 Conductor Electrical Wire is a reliable and versatile option for various electrical applications. Its flexibility, tinned copper conductors, and durable construction make it ideal for automotive, lighting, marine, and other low voltage projects. I would rate this wire five out of five stars for its quality, performance, and versatility. It has met and exceeded my expectations, and I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable and durable electrical wire for their projects."

        "B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ <b>Quality wire in a durable jacket</b> I acquired this cable to wire some repair some existing lights and add supplemental warning lights on my tractor. Wire for rear tractor lighting needs to be run along the underside where brush, sticks, briars claw away at it constantly. More than once, I have had wiring damaged or destroyed. I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications. I really like this wire, and I look forward to using it to upgrade my tractor warning lights in preparation for spring. It would be equally suitable for use on a mowers or trailers as well. I think this product will provide adequate protection for wiring in a tough environment for a long time. In fact, with good end connections, I am hopeful that it will last as long as the equipment.",

However, this is good line for all weather outdoor use. On/in/under a vehicle, and is going to handle friction and stretching well. It is UL2464 Complaint, which means in a nutshell: It’s certified safe as an “external interconnect cable”. AKA: You’re alright using this outside; even burying it underground. The wire jackets/sheathing itself are robust and flexible as with the primary jacket/sheath. It also has a good bit of copper (tin also) in its makeup. This on paper and upon observation this is very good wire. I wouldn’t use it to jump a car battery, or wire up a competition car audio system (been there, done that, and was a garage manager) but low power on/off applications in all weather environments, you’re going to be just fine.

        "B0CH2R3XNH ★★★★☆ <b>Copper Clad * ALUMINUM * for maybe 10 amps</b> This product sort of tricked me. I saw 12/2 wire and I’m just so used to everything being copper that I didn’t notice this listing is for CCA (Copper Clad Aluminum). That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but if - like me - you see 12 AWG and have a knee jerk expectation this can carry twenty amps then you’re going to be disappointed. That said, you don’t normally need that kind of amperage in a low voltage system anyway. What tipped me off was measuring the resistance. When I join the two ends of this roll to get a 240-ft loop, I measure 1.0 ohms (after subtracting out 0.1 for my test leads). That’s about double what I’d expect from 12 AWG copper, and puts it more in the neighborhood of 16 AWG copper. So we’re looking at wire here that can carry something in the neighborhood of ten amps — assuming you have enough voltage to even make that happen. This is a consideration that I don’t see mentioned in the product listing at the time of this writing. And that’s probably fine for most garden lighting projects (up to maybe 100W, hopefully not all going down one wire). LED lights these days really don’t use a whole lot of power. So if this product meets your needs then by all means go for it. I see nothing to complain about in terms of build quality and fully expect it to survive direct burial operation. I just want to make sure you’re not under-sizing your wire. And, just to be clear, this wire is for low voltage applications. If you’re looking to carry line voltage without running conduit then you probably want UF-B wire instead and there are rules about how deep you have to bury it (usually one foot at the very least — and that’s assuming you have ground fault protection).",

This should carry anywhere from 14 to 22+ amps of current, depending on the temperature you are comfortable running at. While the silicone insulator may be good up to 200ºC, I'd probably stay below 90ºC (194ºF). At 600 volts, this could deliver 8.4kW up to 13.2kW of power, depending on your sensitivity for temperature! But at 12 volts, more like 168 watts. Or 48 volts, 672 watts. Fun stuff, electricity! This has been great to have around while building out USB-C PD devices to run everything in my house but small appliances off of USB-C PD 3.0 and 3.1.

The trade-off is that it doesn't \"behave\" like regular plastic-coated wire BECAUSE the silicone doesn't kink easily. The wire WILL bend but it's slightly more challenging to work with because of the silicone. Also, if the silicone takes a hard bend, I doubt it will show it like the plastic-coated wire. If plastic-coated wire gets \"smashed\" you can see the damage to the sheath and wire. Overall, I think I like it. I will only use it in low-voltage applications though so it seems like the heat benefit of the silicone is somewhat lost.",

        "B0CLBHT8YX ★★★★☆ <b>Good for small projects</b> It seems I'm always scrounging for sections of wire on different RV projects and usually find something leftover from an older finished project that works but maybe is not the best (such as by adding pigtails). This has 5 fifty foot rolls of 5 colors that should end the scrounging. This is a copper clad aluminum core (CCA) wire. The copper reduces corrosion caused by moisture and oxidation and adds surface conductivity. I got it to use for some small 12V wiring projects in the RV (additional 12 volt computer fan for gas refrigerator cooling) and to have on hand when I just need some short lengths of wire. For reference, Cu Clad Al (CCA) wire can be used for main wire projects but at a much larger gauge as aluminum has a higher resistance than copper. 12 AWG is recommended for a 15 Amp 110V circuit and 10 AWG for a 20 Amp. This is a 36 strand 16 AWG braided wire so it's not made for heavy loads or 110 volt wiring. Specs are for up to 80 volts. The wire is flexible and there's enough copper coating for it to solder easily to itself. If there's trouble having the wire stick, a copper infused solder works. I used some lead free Rosin Core 2.0 Sn99 Ag0.3 Cu0.7 electronics solder and everything was sucked into the wire and stuck together. I couldn't find the percent by weight of copper anywhere on the rolls, package, or website. The range for CCA is anywhere from 10% to 24% by weight, with the more the better (but also more expensive). 15 small zip ties and 10 heat shrink tubes are included in the box. I'm never going to use this on a main AC wiring project but for small electrical projects, it's a good economical choice and should last a long time. If you don't want 5 colors and a dispenser box, 4-color roll packages of 100'/roll 16AWG of this brand are the same price if you shop around. 4 stars - copper specs not given."

A small family of raccoons can easily do $500-worth of damage in a single night, so it needs to be as protected as we can get it. The low-impedance charger is in the barn, with a lead wire taking the charge out to the fence. That would work OK without some of this wire - until we took the tractor or pickup out to pick some corn for the stand. For that, a drive-thru gate is needed. A buried wire/cable is the most practical way to build one of those, IF the wire is designed to be buried, as this one is. We won't need the fence for six months, so I haven't had a chance to actually use it yet. But, this looks to be much stronger and more durable, less prone to breakage from driving over it, than any gate wire we've used so far. An excellent value."

        "B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ <b>Works great for farm use</b> The RiteFENCE Electric Fence Double Insulated Underground Hard Cable is working perfectly for use 'underneath' my 12' and 16' foot double gates that lead to my pasture. For years I have used a system where I disconnect my electric fence by hand to open my gates without getting shocked. I dug a small trench about 6\" deep under a couple of my gates and buried the RiteFENCE, and left each end protrude out of the ground about two feet to connect to one of the lower existing fence wires so as not to disconnect the continuous circuit at any time when opening gates now. I chose the 6\" depth to bury the heavily insulated RiteFENCE since in addition to moving livestock through the gates, I also drive vehicles and farm implements through the gates as well. The RiteFENCE is very sturdy and rigid, and the 12-½ gauge took some time to straighten out to fit flat and neatly into the trenches I dug and placed the wire into, but this is a definite plus for electric fence wire to be used on a farm or ranch. The RiteFENCE doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and has a thick outer coating with the inner wire apparently coated as well for the 'double insulation' aspect. When installing, I also cut back a couple of inches of the RiteFENCE on each end and used a heavy duty crimp connection to the barb wire fencing I use. Once crimped, I neatly wrapped the connections with quality electrical tape to seal from the elements. The RiteFENCE is going to be ideal for many other underground connection needs I have around the farm. I would highly recommend any farmers and ranchers who run electric fence to give the RiteFENCE a try if you want to eliminate the risk of a nasty shock, especially with the higher powered fence chargers. The price point seems very fair and in fact is actually a little cheaper than what I saw at my local farm supply store. Highly recommend!"

This is UL listed which is a must and probably standard on this type of wire. Cheaper per foot than shorter lengths. 100 feet is nice because I will always have a need for this exact wire. Just finished two outlets and one light including a switch in the shed. The packaging is impressive. The wire is coiled neatly. A bit of a struggle to remove it though. It appears identical to the wire in the local stores only less expensive. I like to save money and every little bit helps. Good product. Good price. I might order more.

This is ultra flexible, with many super-fine strands and silicone rubber insulation marked 200C (higher than PVC but lower than PTFE). The fine strands (150 of them, but I didn't count!) can be a bit of a challenge when crimping contacts... make sure no microscopic strands escape the crimp -- then it works great. The insulation is thick but soft: very easy to work with but also easily damaged if used in the wrong application. It's the right cable for routing in tight locations, since it's so willing to bend and lay flat... good for DIY drones (flexing arms or retracting legs) or making wiring harnesses that need to flex but are well protected from abrasion and pinching. For more rugged high-temp insulation, consider PTFE but it is much more difficult to work with and hard to find at a reasonable price. As noted by others, some colors are a bit off. Red is clearly orange, and blue is gray-purple. That's okay for my purposes, but maybe not if you are building to a print for assemblies that will be inspected. The velcro wraps keep each spool neat, and the box is good for organizing these spools when lots of other wire spools are around."

I but two rolls of it and that was good because you use it up fast because it's thick. I think I got maybe a dozen hoops 3 ft high out of a roll, maybe a little more. That corresponds to probably each piece 8 or so feet long when you count the foot they're in the ground on each side. It's strong enough that I can stick it straight in the ground a foot and it will maintain its shape. A lighter gauge I'd probably have to put a metal or PVC tube of some kind in the ground and put the wire inside the tube.

        "B07GH7JHG9 ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Beware of Copper Clad Aluminum Wire!</b> When shopping for Cat5e or Cat6 network cables, make sure you are comparing apples to apples. One of the most common tactics of the “low cost leaders” is to use aluminum instead of copper wire. This can lead to network issues from using inferior materials to transmit the signal. Looking to cut costs, manufacturers started using aluminum wire dipped in a thin coating of copper. This technique created an aluminum core cable surrounded by a thin layer of copper. The performance and safety of CCA cables are radically different. In fact, aluminum network cables violate TIA and IEC standards for Cat5e and Cat6 cables. CCA cable has higher attenuation than pure copper cables. This results in a greater loss of data, as packets have to be re-transmitted. The more data that is re-transmitted, the slower your network performs. Plus, these problems are compounded by every foot of cable you use; the longer the cable, the worse the performance. CCA cables also have a 55% higher DC resistance. This increases the amount of energy that is transferred into heat and reduces the amount of power that can be transferred. This issue makes them unusable for power over Ethernet (PoE) devices like IP cameras and phones. These cut corners also affect installers because aluminum wire creates installation issues. Due to the lower tensile strength, aluminum cables can be damaged when being pulled. Single conductors can break, making the cable useless, or the whole cable can snap. Aluminum also has a lower bend radius than pure copper cables. This means you can’t bend it as much before it fails. In short, spend the extra money on solid core copper cable."

This is an important electrical safety feature that should be followed. Recently an ice storm interrupted power at my house for two days. My portable generator was able to provide electricity for only some parts of the house. The Wi-Fi router what is across the house and the outlets serving it did not have power. I used this extension cord at it’s full 50 foot length to run electricity from an energized outlet to my Wi-Fi router.

It’s bubbled and extra thick in places so if you accidentally find a piece like that, you lose 1 inch to 1 foot recutting the wire until you find an inch or two that will push into the connector.

It strips well and feels like it should last. I'm happy with the value, for sure."

They closely replicate the original cloth-covered power cords of the 1920s and '30s. The Rayon cover of this cord will fray when cut so you may want to do the following for best results when cutting and terminating the wire. before cutting the wire use a match or small heat gun to \"cook\" the rayon about 1.25 inches long. Cut the cord in the center of the melted area then use a good wite stripper to remove the insulation. Be sure to leave some of the melted rayon behind or the rayon will fray and make a mess. If the outer rayon does fray don't touch it, just hit it with a match or lighter flame and it will self seal as it melts. The rayon is thin so don't overdo it with the heat or it will melt holes in it. If you are replacing an old power cord add a fuse holder with a properly sized fuse to the device you are repairing to make it safer. Overall this cord looks and works great!"

I really liked the dispenser shown in the product photos and video and, to be completely honest, I ordered this wire at least considering it supposedly came with the nifty dispenser box. The \"dispenser\" box has 3 holes on each side, ostensibly to allow you to pull the wire from the box. However, the box is so tight, you can barely get it to close, so, when closed, it does not allow the individual spools to move freely at all. At best, when you pull one strand, the spool next to it also moves to some extent. The wire itself appears to be fantastic - very supple and super flexible. The silicone insulation is on the thick side, so any sharp bends or small nicks probably won't have a big impact on the stranded wire within. The also include some matching zip-ties and (what I am assuming is) heat-shrink tubing. Since the review is for the wire itself, I won't take any stars for the disappointing \"dispenser\" box because the wire is actually really nice."

Each strand of the 20 gauge twisted wire has been tinned before the wire was twisted and insulated in colored silicone but the ends should be tinned again before soldering to a terminal to provide the best solder connection.

The prices for these spools are cheaper than similar PVC coated wires at Walmart for 20 gauge wire and these have more expensive silicone coating and tinned copper. Price wise these are very good wires and good for small projects or repairs on electronics. The wire is very flexible and good for replacing cheaper wires in outdoor equipment that are subject to the elements or chemicals. The silicone is good for almost degrees 400F which is great for power and heating equipment as they are more chemical resistant and won't melt as easily. I have two outdoor portable water heaters used for camping and the wiring on the units use the cheaper PVC and the insulation can melt when the heaters are used for extended periods.

I putter around with offgrid solar power and battery setups, have several at home in addition to my grid-tied system and like to help friends set their own systems up as well. For that you really need some good heavy high-quality copper wire, because once you get the system down to 12 or 24v, you need to pull quite a few amps to power reasonable-sized inverters, and that means thick copper, and sometimes multiple strands of it. I create my own power cables using copper crimping ends, sometims with two parallel 4AWG lenghs used in parallel as a single cable, and kept as short as feasible. This cable works well for that. It’s reasonably flexible and seems to take the power just fine. I consider copper to be a precious metal; won’t be all that long until it costs a lot more than it does now, because the ore grades are falling inexorably around the world, it’s getting more energetically remote.

Connecting wires to a battery and inverter get hot. Regular wires will not work in this setup and I need thicker wires. I have found that 12 to 4 gauge wires work best for me. Thicker wires connecting the big things and 12 gauge leading to my appliances. This wire is easy to use and is extremely flexible. It is easy to connect and cut. The plastic can take high temps as well as the wire. This wire will help save fuses as other wires I used caused my fuses to pop way to often.

        "B0CG1GSW3P ★★★★★ <b>Very nice 10 AWG stranded copper core wire!</b> I'm using this for RV wiring, from deep cycle batteries to high power LED flood lights, solar, water pump, etc. The seller doesn't appear to be overstating anything. The wire is flexible, stranded, copper (each strand is tinned) and should have no issues meeting the power and temperature specs. 10 gauge is far more than most people will need for most basic RV wiring, but if you aren't sure, check with an electrician. I added pictures of the strands, before and after applying high heat. Note, the end of the strands ball up, which is a trait of copper, not aluminum. The tinning is easily burned from the wire to show the copper core. This is good stuff, actually great, considering what I see as the price of around 34 bucks. I'm pleasantly surprised!"

        "B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★☆ <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again)."

        "B01K4RPB3O ★★★★★ <b>Good quality, high strand-count high flexibility tinned wire with silicone rubber insulation</b> This 22 AWG (gauge) silicone insulated wire is excellent for indoor or protected environments where high flexibility/lack of stiffness, and non-melting (or at least melt resistant) insulation is required. The conductors are a 'high strand count\" type, meaning that instead of being comprised of just a few larger/thicker strands, it is instead comprised of a much greater number of smaller/thinner strands; and this contributes to its lack of stiffness/great flexibility. The other contributing factor to the high flexibility is that the insulation is silicone rubber, rather than the more common PVC (which is rather stiff). This kind of high strand count, silicone rubber insulated wire is exactly what high quality test equipment 'test leads' have been made of for decades. The silicone rubber is also much less heat sensitive than more common insulations such as PVC or \"machine tool wire\". It won't melt off as readily as PVC insulation does if your soldering iron needs to be held onto a joint or terminal for an extended period of time. The fine wire strands are also nicely tinned, and the insulation strips off easily and cleanly, and the stranded wire solders easily. It is a good quality product at an affordable price. HOWEVER, it is not the best choice for many common \"hook up wire\" applications, since its lack of stiffness can be an issue; the strands definitely need to be twisted and soldered in order to keep their shape enough to be formed into a hook before soldering around a terminal for example. This wire also does not want to cooperate if you want to twist a few of them together, because their limpness makes them uncooperative in that regard. And if you use this wire in \"hook up wire\" applications, it wants to just flop into some odd position rather than 'staying put' where you want it to be. Silicone rubber insulation is also not that great when it comes to abrasion resistance, and resistance to some kinds of oils and such where other insulations may be preferable."

        "B0BYNNJS8B ★★★★★ <b>Super Flex - Silicone Insulation</b> Super Duper High Temperature Flexible Silicone Insulation!! I don't remember when I've worked with wire this flexible. The Silicone is so 'rubbery' it's almost hard to cut and both the insulation and the wire is as flexible as the insulation. It doesn't 'hold' a shape well at all it's just so flexible. The high temp insulation makes it nice for soldering, it doesn't shrink off or split out from the heat of nearby soldering - and the temp range is also low (cold). I didn't test it, but the low end spec is -76F.. (So obviously I'd have something special around to make any claim about testing it anywhere near that.) I'll have to pickup a couple new rolls for my next trip to Antarctica (lol). It's a whole bunch heavier at 10 gauge than I normally use but I have a couple projects that will use up most of, if not all of the rolls. I'm adding fog lights to my car and I'm rewiring a couple speakers. It feels so nice that if I have any left, I may just rig up a new set of test leads for my multi-meter. Also available in smaller gauges, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 & 22, those other sizes are probably more commonly used and more in line with the size I'd usually pickup for small general purpose projects - but the fog lights, can draw a bunch of current, so for a 10 ft run in a car, this can handle >200 watts, or plenty enough for my fog lights.",

        "B01K4RPB3O ★★★★★ <b>Good quality, high strand-count high flexibility tinned wire with silicone rubber insulation</b> This 22 AWG (gauge) silicone insulated wire is excellent for indoor or protected environments where high flexibility/lack of stiffness, and non-melting (or at least melt resistant) insulation is required. The conductors are a 'high strand count\" type, meaning that instead of being comprised of just a few larger/thicker strands, it is instead comprised of a much greater number of smaller/thinner strands; and this contributes to its lack of stiffness/great flexibility. The other contributing factor to the high flexibility is that the insulation is silicone rubber, rather than the more common PVC (which is rather stiff). This kind of high strand count, silicone rubber insulated wire is exactly what high quality test equipment 'test leads' have been made of for decades. The silicone rubber is also much less heat sensitive than more common insulations such as PVC or \"machine tool wire\". It won't melt off as readily as PVC insulation does if your soldering iron needs to be held onto a joint or terminal for an extended period of time. The fine wire strands are also nicely tinned, and the insulation strips off easily and cleanly, and the stranded wire solders easily. It is a good quality product at an affordable price. HOWEVER, it is not the best choice for many common \"hook up wire\" applications, since its lack of stiffness can be an issue; the strands definitely need to be twisted and soldered in order to keep their shape enough to be formed into a hook before soldering around a terminal for example. This wire also does not want to cooperate if you want to twist a few of them together, because their limpness makes them uncooperative in that regard. And if you use this wire in \"hook up wire\" applications, it wants to just flop into some odd position rather than 'staying put' where you want it to be. Silicone rubber insulation is also not that great when it comes to abrasion resistance, and resistance to some kinds of oils and such where other insulations may be preferable."

That's really all I can say about it that is positive. It's very flimsy. Which makes it difficult to pass it through body routing channels...and it doesn't stay in place very well when soldering. Stiffer wire can be bent and be held in place easily. Usually you can just form it to sit in a lug, and you can just solder them in place...this stuff doesn't hold its form. It's really really flimsy...even when using a helping hand jig. It was very frustrating. It worked, but I will be ordering some quality wire for my future builds."

It means you can run a short length of about 18 without a messy tangle of wire, separate the ends where they solder to the tabs. The wires are pre-tinned, so once you remove ¼ inch of the sleeve, you can solder directly without taking more time fiddling and tinning yourself.

Insulation on this wire is a lot more heat resistant and the heat can be cranked up to solder guitar pots faster. The insulation also low(ish) friction, so if you zip-tie a couple together, they stay put. The cable is very soft and flexible which is great in things that are regularly moved around. This is also a negative as these wires have no memory and can not retain certain shape, kind of hard to tuck them somewhere or push out of the way as they are like rubber bands."

I was originally looking at 5-wire cables (after all, that's all I really needed), but then I saw this 18-gauge, 8-wire cable for just a few dollars more and decided to go with it instead. This would provide a degree of future-proofing (such as adding a whole-house humidifier, extra sensors, or the like in the future). This 18-gauge, 8-wire cable was thicker and stiffer than my old 20-gauge (?), 4-wire cable, and thus a bit trickier to pull through the wall from the thermostat to the furnace (be sure to check your cable path first to ensure it will fit (width of thru-holes, radius of bends, etc.). But, I just taped one end of the new cable to the old cable, crossed my fingers, and started a pullin'. Thankfully, with a bit of elbow grease, it worked! It looks and feels high quality and came in ample length for my needs (and then some). I used a 'Uxcell a10073000ux0031 2 Pcs 8 Position Double Row Screw Terminal Covered Barrier Strip 600V 25A' to connect the new 8-wire cable (right) to the existing furnace wiring (left)."

My new smart thermostat needed all six wires (It could have done with 4 with an adapter but didn't want to chance it). I spliced in the wiring like-for-like colors using this wiring and small gage wire nuts, and terminated the connections to the furnace control board matching the colors specified in the manual. Worked like a charm. 20 minutes work solved that issue."

        "B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ <b>Great for DIYers and reasonably priced for copper with silicone insulation</b> The price for copper wire has gone up so dramatically in the last few years, I did a lot of rewiring in my house a few years back and a spool of 12/2 1000 feet Romex was $260 and now over $500 a roll at Lowes or HomeDepot. The prices for these spools are cheaper than similar PVC coated wires at Walmart for 20 gauge wire and these have more expensive silicone coating and tinned copper. Price wise these are very good wires and good for small projects or repairs on electronics. The wire is very flexible and good for replacing cheaper wires in outdoor equipment that are subject to the elements or chemicals. The silicone is good for almost degrees 400F which is great for power and heating equipment as they are more chemical resistant and won't melt as easily. I have two outdoor portable water heaters used for camping and the wiring on the units use the cheaper PVC and the insulation can melt when the heaters are used for extended periods. I have had to wrap the wires in aluminum heat wrap to protect the PVC cables now I can repair them with the silicone wires without having to wrap them with protective aluminum heat shields."

These are incredibly fast and convenient - no argument there, and it's why I'm willing to pay a few more bucks than rolling my own. The downside that I've seen - the connectors on these seem a bit brittle. After finishing the first install (electrical) I was installing the refrigeration lineset. When I removed the cover, I put a little force (I do mean little) on the side of this whip - and the connector broke cleanly away from the conduit. I've not had this happen with ones I've put together on my own - and now get to repair this one - which kind of negates why I bought it in the first place. C'est la vie. If you're gentle with them, and don't mind the fixed length - they can save you a little time (and if you don't have any THHN on hand, money - especially if you just need a short length) - but if you don't mind spending just a little more time... roll your own.",

This wire isn’t that way the insulation is thick enough without it taking the place of the copper wire. This wire is flexible which is what you look for when buying a good quality wire because the cheaper stuff is stiff and hard to bend. So far I’ve used this for my 340 fuel pump on my turbo Foxbody and I’m going to be using it for my electric fan on the foxbody.

        "B07T6LJD6M ★★★★★ <b>Replaced 45 year old 4 conductor cable</b> Installed a new HVAC system and figured it was time to upgrade the thermostat wiring from 4 conductor to 5. Modern “smart” and Wi-Fi thermostats need that 5th conductor. Once I figured out how to pull this cable thru the wall it was easy to match up the colors to the system control panel terminals. The insulation used on this cable seemed easier to “strip” than other wire I’ve worked with which was nice. Amazon Prime delivery was super fast; less than 24 hours from order to receipt.",
        "B07T19567J ★★★★★ <b>Perfect for upgrading your Furnace for a smart Thermostat</b> I got this to replace my current 18/5 (18 gauge, 5 strands) wire from my thermostat to my basement. The new thermostat needed the additional wire for the \"C-wire\" to properly power the thermostat because it's a smart thermostat. Before you start make sure you need 6 strands, some may need more or less. You may not need a new wire. The install was pretty simple but could be wildly different for you depending on how it's wired. For me, I just cute the old wire at the thermostat, taped the new wire to it overlapping about 6 inches and then went to the basement to pull the old wire bringing the new one through. Since all the holes mine went through were good size it went through no problem. Since it's such a small wire (compared to electrical), hopefully yours is, too. You'll need some basic wire cutters and trimmers. If you've never done this before it's pretty easy but you should probably watch a YouTube video and practice on an end of the wire you can cut off. Don't want to expose any of the copper wire and cause a short. The wires are all the same regardless of color, that's for your benefit to differentiate them at the thermostat and furnace ends. Make sure you're very meticulous about this. Be sure to power down your furnace before starting there. Check YouTube for guides. In the process I blew a fuse on my furnace and got the blinking light, 5 times. I'm not sure what I did that caused that (probably use error this project was a first for me), but the fuse was near the wire inputs. Was cheap and easy to replace but essential to getting my furnace running again.",

Well, decades later I am experienced and educated about thermostat wire cable. Very, very, rarely is the problem caused by bad thermostat wire cable itself. The thermostat wire problem is always caused by a person doing something wrong: stapling through the thermostat cable, shorting the conductors across a power transformer, crushing the thermostat wire cable between boards or vents, cutting the thermostat wire cable with a weed wacker, and etc.. Of course, I use a special staple gun that installs high arch staples that will not crush the thermostat wire cable. I run “loose” runs that can be “stretched” when necessary. I like this brand of thermostat wire cable. I like to think my thermostat wiring will last as long as the house; or at least until some new system upgrade of some kind that needs special wiring.",

The only reason I don't give it five stars is, it came in bag, as just a coil of wire, without any spool or anything. Originally, I didn't think that would matter. But when running the wire, the unmanaged coil kept getting tangled. I eventually restored to unwinding it all by hand, laying it out flat, up a staircase and down a hall.

        "B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ <b>Wire set for DIY, STEM projects, education</b> Eight colours of 18 guage wire with ties and shrink tubes to match, plus a basic mini wire stripper - this makes a good introduction kit for the kids STEM projects, and for me to have some spare for lighting architectural models. The storage box is useful for keeping wire clean and organised, while having holes to pull through lengths neatly. That's a bonus to me as I like an organised workspace and to teach that to the kids. The wires are easy to work with, flexible and clean. The two colours we've used have no defects. Will make a good gift too."

Moved wire on Y2 to common, and used this to allow W2 and Y2 share a single wire. My Nest worked fine without common, but I didn’t want take a chance with battery issues under different usage conditions. Battery is now at a constant 3.94 volts. The soft wires are easier to work with than the original solid copper wires. The diode is much smaller than some other “add a wire” product, so I was able to fit it in the tiny space I have (not a hollow wall).",

One of the most important parts of any DIY or Electronic device install is the wiring. Don't use bad or old wiring to carry your signal or power, always use new, good shielded wires. You will notice better sound, brighter lights and more consistent operations of your projects with new wiring. This kit comes with both black and red spools and has a high quality sheath on the wire itself. It was easy to use and to solder and I had no issues with my automotive LED lights project."

The double protective cover is essential for your safety. The internal wires are very thin and this makes the cable more malleable and durable. The black cable is also a plus point as it won't look old and dirty quickly. A handy cable for your household needs. I recommend."

Good for around the house but forget about using where high temperature and liquid hazard material would be present which would make this cable into a puddle of Ooze. I would buy it again knowing what I'm using this cable for.",

        "B0CNXJ9H6Q ★★★★★ <b>Great for small projects</b> I ordered this wire for one of my daughter's science experiments. The ten foot roll is the perfect size for small projects. This wire comes neatly wound on a plastic spool and shrink wrapped to avoid oxidation. It has a high quality PVC shield, which isn't very easy to strip. It provides plenty of insulation. The thick shielding causes this wire to spring off the spool, so as soon as I opened it, I had to rewind it and secure it with a rubber band. The wire is properly marked and is UL listed. This seems to be high quality wire, but I have limited experience with electric wiring. Fortunately, this is the perfect size for testing, and it is available in other length options, so it's worth experimenting before committing to a larger project."
