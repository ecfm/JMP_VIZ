The plus is that it's essentially a dual-mono cable that can be easily deployed for keyboard patching or any other stereo signal source. That being said, they do not feel as if they will last very long with the hard conditions of touring. They seem pretty flexible (thin) and the jacks don't have any strain relief or extra thickness (think added collar or shrink-wrap). I bought them on a whim because I needed a few short 'stereo' source cables for tour (and I needed them quick), and after 7 shows at least one of these cables exhibit intermittent noise spikes out of nowhere. So yeah, they were delivered Feb. 15th (2023) and it's currently March 13th. About a month and I'm already experiencing the tell tale signs of these going bad. Live and learn."

The sound clarity is the high quality you should expect from optical. I will say that I wouldn't go any longer than 25 feet for an optical cable due to the potential for signal degradation, and if a shorter cable will do, I would go that route for the same reason. The shorter the cable the less chance for signal degradation --- although, again, I didn't personally notice any with this running from my TV to my soundbar."

This would also be a good interconnect for high power HF use, where losses are so small as to be negligible. That’s assuming the cable meets LMR-400 specs. LMR-400 is a trademark of Times Microwave. Other companies making equivalent cable give it other names, like “ABC-400.” I asked if this was actual Times Microwave cable, and got a somewhat equivocal answer, so I suspect it is not.

The wire is encased in a flexible PVC jacket that not only makes it durable but also ensures it is waterproof, oil-proof, and UV-resistant. This is a crucial aspect for outdoor installations, providing peace of mind that the wire can withstand various weather conditions without compromising its integrity. The 18-gauge thickness is perfect for low voltage applications, such as LED lighting and automotive speakers. The stranded design adds flexibility, making it easy to work with and allowing for smooth installations even in tight spaces. Additionally, the direct burial capability is a notable advantage, eliminating the need for conduit in certain situations. I found the cable easy to strip and terminate, making the installation process straightforward. The overall build quality instills confidence in its longevity, and I appreciate the attention to detail in its design. In summary, the 18 Gauge Electrical Wire has proven to be a reliable and durable solution for outdoor lighting projects. Its waterproof and UV-resistant properties, combined with the flexibility of the stranded design, make it an ideal choice for anyone seeking a high-quality cable for low voltage landscape lighting and other outdoor applications."

        "<b>Excellent cable, shipped with incorrect cable combs (FasGear later shipped correct combs)</b> Received these cables back in July for a new build and was quite pleased with the quality of construction of the cable and the sleeving. The 70cm length is quite generous and made routing simple. My only issue is that the images online showed cable combs that controlled the power cables as well as the smaller sense cables in a sort of over-under configuration. The combs that came with the cable only control the power cables. Due to the small size of the sense wires they don't have any sort of structural rigidity and sort of just flop wherever inside the case, which is both a bad look and increases risk of damage. I sent an email to Fasgear on July 3rd but have not received any response over a month later. EDIT: Shortly after this review FasGear reached out and sent me the correct cable combs at no charge.

The cord I got is 75 feet long, and then splits off into three separate 8 foot sections, each with a glowing outlet and seal at the end. The fact that they glow is so convenient for finding the end in the grass. The seal on the end means that you don't have to actually utilize all three of the ends for it to be weather protected.

Each lead, red and black have a substantial insulating cover. In addition, both leads/wires are surrounded by another insulation layer that binds everything together. The finished product is round and smooth. This is designed as a direct burial wire. That means it can be used outside, including in the dirt just as it is. However, remember to make all connections perfectly watertight. Part of my project will have the wire exposed to direct sunlight. So I feel certain it will hold up for a long time. Today I made connections using this wire by soldering as well as crimping connectors. I was super pleased with how it performed. Thanks for reading my review!

They apologized for the mistake and offered to immediately send out a new set of the correct wire combs the next day, free of charge! I received the new correct wire combs as shown in the product pages, and they work perfectly! I am updating this review to 5 stars to reflect the quality of the product and the excellent and prompt customer service provided by Fasgear! Thanks Fasgear! DEFINITELY WILL BUY AGAIN! === These 12VHPWR cables are very high quality and work very well. However, they do NOT come with the wire combs as shown in the images. The wire combs should have slots for 12+4 wire cable design (16 wire slots total). However, the combs I received in the packaging are just standard 12 wire cable design combs (only 12 wire slots) without the additional 4 wire signal comb on the back side (see image). This means the additional 4 signal wires on the cable are left unsecured! The only way to secure them is with wire zip ties which defeats the whole purpose of combed wire cables! This is unacceptable and very disappointing! Maybe I received an incorrectly packaged cable, but I'm hesitant to even exchange these as I don't know that I'll get one with proper combs or not. Also, I can't really take my system offline until I can get a new cable, so I'm stuck with zip tied signal wires, sadly! BUYER BEWARE!

Apple LED Cinema Display on PC! mDP / DP to HDMI with no issues!</b> I was in need of an adapter that can convert a DisplayPort signal to HDMI for use with my consoles and primarily my PC, as my ASUS GTX 1080 Ti has only 2 DisplayPorts and 2 HDMI’s and have 3 DisplayPort monitors. My config is a Dell 27” G Sync Display, and 2 Apple LED Cinema 27” Displays from 2010 (not thunderbolt). All are 2560x1440p, exception being the Dell can do 144hz and the Apple’s do 60hz. I have verified that even when using mDP extensions, mDP to DP adapters, and various PC’s and consoles that the adapter works flawlessly! No artifacting, no ghosting, no perceivable input lag vs direct connection. HDMI audio supports. It’s a good adapter, much better than no name brands. If you wish to connect an Apple LED Cinema Display, or any DisplayPort monitor to an HDMI device this is it for you. Note: using this adapter doesn’t provide overridden EDID data, and it’s up to the OS to provide support for the resolutions the monitor can handle. The Apple LED Cinema 27 Display only supports 1280x720 and 2560x1440 even on macOS. Using Windows it can support a broad range of resolutions since it’ll scale approximately using whatever GPU driver you have. On consoles it’s not that simple. Nintendo Switch only supports its 720p mode, PS4 / PS4 Pro doesn’t support it at all, and Xbox One consoles support all resolutions. I have no information if this is better on the PS5 / Xbox Series SX consoles. This is not a knock on the adapter but rather informing you this adapter does a raw active pass through without changing EDID data."

        "<b>Works great! Apple LED Cinema Display on PC! mDP / DP to HDMI with no issues!</b> I was in need of an adapter that can convert a DisplayPort signal to HDMI for use with my consoles and primarily my PC, as my ASUS GTX 1080 Ti has only 2 DisplayPorts and 2 HDMI’s and have 3 DisplayPort monitors. My config is a Dell 27” G Sync Display, and 2 Apple LED Cinema 27” Displays from 2010 (not thunderbolt). All are 2560x1440p, exception being the Dell can do 144hz and the Apple’s do 60hz. I have verified that even when using mDP extensions, mDP to DP adapters, and various PC’s and consoles that the adapter works flawlessly! No artifacting, no ghosting, no perceivable input lag vs direct connection. HDMI audio supports. It’s a good adapter, much better than no name brands. If you wish to connect an Apple LED Cinema Display, or any DisplayPort monitor to an HDMI device this is it for you. Note: using this adapter doesn’t provide overridden EDID data, and it’s up to the OS to provide support for the resolutions the monitor can handle. The Apple LED Cinema 27 Display only supports 1280x720 and 2560x1440 even on macOS. Using Windows it can support a broad range of resolutions since it’ll scale approximately using whatever GPU driver you have. On consoles it’s not that simple. Nintendo Switch only supports its 720p mode, PS4 / PS4 Pro doesn’t support it at all, and Xbox One consoles support all resolutions. I have no information if this is better on the PS5 / Xbox Series SX consoles. This is not a knock on the adapter but rather informing you this adapter does a raw active pass through without changing EDID data."

        "<b>Works Intimately</b> SOURCE: X-Box Series X MONITOR: Asus ROG Swift PG279Q OUTPUT: (2K) 2560 x 1440 @ 120Hz DOES IT WORK: Yes.... And No (explanation below). ISSUE: After 5 minutes of gameplay, I will lose picture from the Xbox and the monitor will say \"NO SIGNAL\". SOLUTION: Disconnecting the HDMI port from the Xbox and replugging it back in will bring the picture back. This will occur 2-3 times before it maintains the picture for the duration of gameplay. SETTINGS: I have attempted all types of settings on the Xbox and on my monitor to see if I can get this issue to stop. It occurs at 120 & 60 frames a second, all color spacings and in manual or automatic display detection. NOTE: Disconnecting the USB power does not cause the monitor to lose signal, I am curious if I might have a defective product. I have also attempted to plug the USB into another power supply in case the Xbox was somehow interrupting power. FINAL THOUGHTS: With putting wear and tear on my connector having to disconnect and re-plug in as well as the interruption it causes during gameplay It might just be better to stick with 60 frames a second using the HDMI. Not all games support 120 at this point anyways so you're not gaining much. Especially with my monitor I have to disconnect the HDMI from the back of the monitor to plug in my PC so the switching back and forth is a pain in the ass."

        "<b>good and easy to use</b> I recently purchased an Apple charging cable for my iPhone, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. Right out of the box, the quality of the cable impressed me. It feels durable and well-made, significantly more robust than non-Apple cables I've used in the past. The connection is always secure, ensuring my phone charges efficiently without any interruptions. What stands out the most is the cable's longevity. Despite daily use and the occasional accidental tug, it has shown no signs of wear or fraying, a common issue with other brands. Additionally, the cable length is just perfect for my needs, offering enough flexibility to use my phone comfortably while charging. Apple's commitment to quality is evident in this charging cable, and it's worth every penny for the peace of mind it brings. Highly recommend to anyone in need of a reliable charging solution for their iPhone.",

I have used it both to charge my phone with a charger as well as used it to sync my phone with iTunes. It has worked well in both situations. The cables feel sturdy with a good tight weave. The ends seem well built and have rubber tension relief which is always good. Can't really complain about anything. They work like they are supposed to!",
        "<b>Charger for newer IPhones</b> These are great. Just what I was looking for and described perfectly.",
        "<b>Finally, A Charging Cable That Works With Everything!</b> I'm tired of carrying a jungle of cables around, so I decided to try the Hunda 4-in-1 Multi USB Charging Cable. The first thing I noticed was the quality of the cable as well as the engineering of the adapter ends. The silicone material feels way more sturdy than those cheap, plasticy cables. It has interchangeable adapter ends allows for quick change from USB-C/A to Lightening/USB-C to charge different devices using the same cable. This is a super nice feature as it eliminates at least three cables that I lug around with me in my backpack. They claim faster charging because of the thickened copper core. I don’t know what that means, but It charges my iPhone ridiculously fast – way faster than the standard cable it came with. Even with my bulky phone case, it connects without issue. If you're looking for a powerful, versatile, well-made charging cable, stop searching. This is the one."

I am not sure if the issues are related to any otter box or just the one that I have but this charging cable will not reach my phone to charge it. I would have to take the case off and that isn't happening. With that being said, however, this has some promise for about anything else. It is working currently as either a power cable for my laptop that uses USB-C and/or a charger for anything else USB-C. It works well for either of those and pretty much anything else except my phone with a case on it. I feel like this is an oversight but it still seems to be made well and versatile in other ways, just different than my original plans for usage. Pros: Seems to be made very well Works well as a charging/power cable for my laptop Does a good job as a USB-C cable Should last a while Cons: Won't fit my iPhone with a protective case"

The cable is very versatile in that you can have 4 variations of cables that this cable can 'morph' to. Usb-A to Lightning Usb-C to lightning Usb-C to Usb-C Usb-A to Usb-C For the most part, I still have an iphone 12 which this comes in handy for. I also have a few apple peripherals like the trackpad, as well as a handful of batteries that take lightning so this cable is very useful. Having a newer iphone 15 which has USB-C will probably not make this cable as useful. I also tried using this cable for my framework laptop which takes a 60W charger and this cable is able to charge the laptop without issues.

However this review is unbiased and based solely on my experience with the product as received. Upon receiving the cable, I examined the box it came in. On the front of the box it is described as being 1500 mm in length. On the rear of the box, it is described as being 2000 mm in length, as shown in the included images. I measured the cable using a tape measure and the cable is indeed 1500 mm or 1.5 meters in length, not including the extra tips on each end. The cable is a solidly constructed green cable with black and clear color plastic on either end of the cable. It is essentially a USB-C to USB-C power and data cable with a USB-A extension on one end and an Apple compatible Lightning connector on the other. The box also contains a string pouch to store and protect the cable, a nice touch in my opinion. I tested the cable with a Pixel 7, an iPad Mini 4, a MacBook Air M1 and a PC running Windows 11. Data file transfers were flawless and fast. A 200 MB pdf file transferred from PC to Android in about 10 seconds. The iPad connected and synced with the MacBook air flawlessly. I also tested charging using a 65 watt USB C charger. The Pixel reported fast charging when connected. The iPad charged successfully. The photos in the review were uploaded to a PC using the USB A connector to a USB hub. Mechanically the cable worked as advertised. I intend to use this cable extensively since it is so versatile. My only concerns were I wonder how sturdily the Lightning and USB tips are attached and I noticed that the Lighting adapter didn't fit as snugly as the other tips did. I also would be hesitant to order this if I was using thick cases for my equipment due to the large size of the cable adapter ends. They might have difficulty fitting if the port opening on the case was too narrow. I did not experience any issues and recommend this cable for anyone currently carrying around a multitude of different cables to connect various tech items. Data transfer and charging both worked well and this will be part of my EDC going forward."

Unfortunately, because of the way the tip of the lightning connector is designed, it is impossible to connect it to my iPhone when it is in the case - the big plastic block around the connector won't let it insert into the charging port. I tried this on multiple phones with multiple cases (I have patient friends). A similar problem occurred with my rechargeable speakers - because of the blocky design of the lightning tip on this charger, I can't get it into the charging port. The only device this worked for was my AirPods charging case. So - if you DON'T use a case on your phone, OR if you only use USB-C devices, this might be for you - the cable DOES work, and it is sturdy. I also like that it is an unusual color so it is unlikely to be left behind or taken by someone else. But the only way I can charge my phone with it is if I fully remove the phone from its case - even the inner case of an OtterBox - and I'm not going to do that.

The rubberized insulation of the cable allows for a really easy, almost effortless bend to the cable. Similarly the end connectors are easy to flip/switch out from Lightning to USB-C on one end and from USB-A to USB-C on the other. The mechanism has a good 'quality' feel to it and I get a good feeling that it will last for years. Small details that hurt the product are that the end connectors' housings are quite thick. This makes it hard to insert and secure it into iPhones with a case, or other devices that only have small areas to which to insert the cable into. In some cases, even if you can get the cable end to fit into the device, it doesn't have a 'good insertion' feel to it where the cable will stay in without purposeful intervention. i.e. the cable can be inserted and charge the device but it easily falls out if the cable is jiggled around.",

Type-A to Lightning is 12w I confirmed some of these charging limitations with an iPad using a 140W multi-socket charger to charge it at 55%, which yielded 3.2A using HUNDA's Mode 4 (Type-A), and 3.9A using Mode 2 (Type-C). The unique see-through design of the hinged double-ended connectors is very stylish, although the sharp corners can be a concern when packing.

The most intriguing thing about the cable is, while it originally comes in a generic looking box, once you open it up, you find a nice carry bag. I have NEVER before seen a bag included with a cable. Not even Apple does that. It's very unique, and certainly helps protect the cable more. Just something I'd never seen before. I love that it fast charges. It has so many various options you can use it with. Great cable. A little pricey, but for $25, I think you could justify having a cable like this with the various flexible options it brings."

I have an electric adjustable-height desk in my makeshift office in our living room.

Using the cord also helps me spread out the electrical load, as our house has older wiring. There are many uses for this flexible cord.

I was confused why some of my cables would charge my stuff and other cables wouldn't, UNTIL I found out these one work only one-way. When using these, you have to take the 50/50 you plugged it in right, or you can just label the right side of your cables. I ended up returning these and buying different ones and still found the same issue, so I don't even know if it is possible to get female to female USB-C to work 2-way. Be wary when buying these if you want your USB-C to plug in HOW THEY ACTUALLY SHOULD. Despite my issues, these are a better price than the other ones I bought because these are a 4-pack for the same price as 2-pack I purchased, so that's good I guess. These seem to have decent quality too."

The wire is encased in a flexible PVC jacket that not only makes it durable but also ensures it is waterproof, oil-proof, and UV-resistant. This is a crucial aspect for outdoor installations, providing peace of mind that the wire can withstand various weather conditions without compromising its integrity. The 18-gauge thickness is perfect for low voltage applications, such as LED lighting and automotive speakers. The stranded design adds flexibility, making it easy to work with and allowing for smooth installations even in tight spaces. Additionally, the direct burial capability is a notable advantage, eliminating the need for conduit in certain situations. I found the cable easy to strip and terminate, making the installation process straightforward. The overall build quality instills confidence in its longevity, and I appreciate the attention to detail in its design. In summary, the 18 Gauge Electrical Wire has proven to be a reliable and durable solution for outdoor lighting projects.

I am using this 18-2 wire as speaker cable in a jeep where the wire travels outside the car. Because it is water and oil resistant, the jacket should last a very long time against whatever gets flung onto it. Because it essentially has two jackets, it is more resistant to abuse, the extra padding slightly helps prevent radio interference in and out as well. What I like ~ • Feels like quality wire ~ the jacket feels like higher end microphone cabling. It's also fairly flexible and easy to shape. • Looks like quality wire ~ as advertised, UL is clearly marked and the jacketing appears to be uniform in thickness around the inner insulators. Copper is tinned and spun neatly. What I do not like ~ nothing to note here.",

However, this is good line for all weather outdoor use. On/in/under a vehicle, and is going to handle friction and stretching well. It is UL2464 Complaint, which means in a nutshell: It’s certified safe as an “external interconnect cable”. AKA: You’re alright using this outside; even burying it underground. The wire jackets/sheathing itself are robust and flexible as with the primary jacket/sheath. It also has a good bit of copper (tin also) in its makeup. This on paper and upon observation this is very good wire. I wouldn’t use it to jump a car battery, or wire up a competition car audio system (been there, done that, and was a garage manager) but low power on/off applications in all weather environments, you’re going to be just fine. I only wish I could have gotten a larger roll. I’d recommend it. Seems better than the line contractors installed underground for our underground sprinkler system.",

I absolutely love this feature as I use extension cords for holidays lights and when it rains, the open plugs get water in the plug and then I blow the fuse. So having the covers help keep the water out. Such a smart idea! I am very pleased with this extension cord!",
        "<b>Exceptional if you have a lot of decorations to plug in</b> I always go overboard with our decorations outside. This is a lifesaver if you have a lot of decorations in one spot. I used to have multiple electrical cords going to one spot. This now saves me the time of plugging everything in as well as saving me multiple cords all over. I will be ordering more as our scenes get bigger every year.",

The green blends into the yard (unlike the orange ones); and it gives me 3 outlets over 50ft! Being as how we are past the holiday season I had to test it indoors; and I did. Everything works as expected. The outlet covers are little hard to get on; but I like having covers in the event that one (or more) outlets are not being used. It rains a lot here in Florida. Keep in mind this cord is only 16AWG; which is only for the lightest of uses. Perfect for holiday lights and decor; some low power tools/appliances; but nothing major; it's not built for high draw voltage.

The cable is nicely built and has lit outlets. The lit outlets are useful to know if this is plugged in or not. The length and multi ends are useful for hooking up my table saw and shop vac. My table saw and shop vac consume about 5 amps a piece. This cable is 16AWG with a multi-core conductors. If this were made with solid core conductors then the max suggested amperage would 15 amps, but using multi-core reduces the max suggested amperage between 6-10 amps since you are losing surface area between each core. The more cores the less max amperage. I would not suggest to use this extension with more then 10 amps of current. With this in mind the cable is very practical and is built well enough to last several years.",

I have used wires before, and know how to strip wires (have a wire stripper and all) So, this worked really well for me. I have a transformer that I attached the wire to and I went around my yard with the wire making sure to leave a lot of slack for if I need to adjust the lights. I didn't bury it yet as I'm still adding lights, but so far, so good. I haven't had any issues with it fraying or being too hard to twist the strands together. They do as wires are supposed to do. I have waterproof connectors that I use, but this is my first time using outdoor wiring. So far, it has rained last night and I didn't notice any issues. The lights worked all night long and when my transformer got the light of the day, it shut off well too. I needed this because I ran out of wire, so this extra makes me able to finalize my setup. I have had no issues so far, and it fits in my connectors just fine. My lights at the end of my strand are just as bright as the ones at the beginning. I like it. It works for me! A+ easy to strip, easy to cut. I feel it'll be easy to bury as that just has to do with me digging dirt. It works for me.",

No more plugging in multiple extension cords to each other, and trying to wrap a bag and tape around them outside, in hopes of not lighting the neighborhood on fire. Enjoy the peace of mind in knowing that you're safely using the extension cord, as it is designed, to power up multiples things at a time. This definitely made the holidays easier this past year. Looking forward to the holiday decoration setup this year."

        "<b>Versatile extension cord, great for outdoor decorations..</b> Although I received this extension cord too late in the 2022 season to use for my outdoor Christmas decorations, I did lay it out and determined it will work amazingly well. The long overall length of the cord allows you to reach out to far away electrical devices and then the branches allow you to run a sealed extension of the same cord to other devices. I was previously running multiple cords across the wet lawn to power up all my decorations. This cord is only 16 gauge wire, so it is limited to 13 amps. This isn't an issue when all you are doing is powering yard decorations or lighting, but be aware that it is not suitable for running power tools or higher amperage devices. The female ends have LED lighting for ease of confirming there is power to the cord ends. They also supply \"caps\" for the female ends that are meant to keep out dust/dirt but would not be considered watertight. I am looking forward to next year when I can put all my decorations out and only run a single extension cord!! Definitely worth a look.",
        "<b>Great outdoor extensions cord for lights, decorations, and more!</b> I really like the balance this strikes between hefty and flexible. It feels like it will withstand years of providing power to outdoor lights, decorations, and even the occasional combination of saw, light, and battery charger, or just about anything else. The cord I got is 75 feet long, and then splits off into three separate 8 foot sections, each with a glowing outlet and seal at the end. The fact that they glow is so convenient for finding the end in the grass. The seal on the end means that you don't have to actually utilize all three of the ends for it to be weather protected. While I might not try to power three high-amp devices at the same time with this, that should be a given, as it only plugs into one, presumably 15 amp, outlet. I highly recommend this indoor/outdoor extension cord!",
        "<b>3 in 1 extension cord</b> The description of the product matches up exactly with what I have received. The extension cord is outdoor rated, flexible in the cold temps, and as a bonus, the end receptacles light up, and have caps to cover them and prevent water, dirt, or debri from getting into the unused plugs. This is a great thing as I used my cord to run decorations to multiple different places in my yard for Christmas. I highly recommend this cord.",

The 30ft length wasn't long enough for my application so I had to buy another roll locally, which was 16/2 and had the 2 wires stuck together like speaker wires would be. I found this wire much easier to work with. 18g is plenty big enough for a string of LED lights, so the 16 was unnecessary. The outer jacket was plenty easy to strip off the wires, and the insulation on the wires themselves was easy to strip. as for soldering all the wires together, I found this wire much easier to work with than the 16g, and the insulation was small enough that the shrink tubing would also shrink over the small gauge wire that was attached to the lights themselves. The wire is also nice and flexible, which made it easy to bury. I only had a standard shovel for the trench, so it had to follow a path that looked kind of like this ~~~~. I very much preferred working with this wire compared to the 16g, which is the opposite of what I expected when I started the project."

I've seen ones with a 3 plug end before, but having each of these split for quite some distance again is unique and perfect for my intended purpose. I'm looking to use this cord for Christmas decorations next year and can tell right now this is going to be perfect. The one thing to take note of for those not familiar, is to be careful not to max out the amperage of the cable with EACH outlet. Remember, the rating for this cable is total combined rating. Don't overload. I love that the extended cords have caps to protect the unused plugs. The cord feels heavy and solid, plug ends look well assembled and sealed. No complaints as of yet.",

        "<b>Awesome Extension cord</b> Love this thing. I can run it all over the place without having to have so many outlets. It is plenty long and I can plug in several strands of lights easily. Yes it is a little pricy but really you are getting 3 cords in one go and I can reach from the back to the front of the house with this.",
        "<b>Perfect, Great Cord!</b> The extension cord has a nice heavy feel to it and is also a nice dark green color. The cord is about 42' before they split off into three 8 feet sections. Each plug does have a cover to keep moisture out if not using it, and the light lets you know that there is power on the plugs. This is perfect for using with Christmas lights as I also have multiple plugs and need a splitter or a second cord. This solves this problem as I can go in different directions now with my lawn lights. The price is not bad and there are so many uses for this cord. It is a great item!"

The one things I don't like about this (which is bound to be a plus for other folks) is how far apart the outlets are spaced. I use it in a server rack and having lots of outlets spaced close together means shorter power cable runs for the servers.

And at any given time it can only do the work of one cable but serially it can do the work of several. On top of that it is extremely well made, the coating seems very high quality, and it is the only charging cable I have that comes with a nice bag and the way the connector ends are attached is far superior to that of other multi-purpose connectors I've seen. The ends are on large, very well made hinge-like pieces that allow you to change one end from Lightening to USB-C and the other from USB-C to USB-A. So, your options are: USB-A to Lightening USB-C to Lightening USB-A to USB-C USB-C to USB-C With the changeover from Lightning to USB-C among Apple devices and most other devices moving to USB-C but the presence of so many USB-A chargers still out there a cable like this is very handy for Apple users who still have products with Lightning connectors. You're covered now and in the future with this cable and you can charge your friends' newer Apple or Andriod products too. I didn't have any trouble getting the Lighting connector to fit my iPhone and iPad while both were in their cases but I understand that this isn't true for everyone. My iPhone case is not an Otterbox nor is my iPad case though the iPad case is a very thick, protective case, it just has a large cutout for the charger. So, if you have Apple devices that use Lightning connectors in heavy, protective cases this might be a somewhat frustrating cable for you but if your devices are in more standard thickness cases it should work well."

        "<b>It may not be Times Microwave, but it feels well made.</b> LMR-400 is a low loss cable that’s good well into the gigahertz range when used with appropriate connectors. This cable is terminated with PL-259 connectors, so it’s probably best used at 450MHz and below. Even so, the short length means that insertion losses will be a fraction of a dB, even at 900MHz. This would also be a good interconnect for high power HF use, where losses are so small as to be negligible. That’s assuming the cable meets LMR-400 specs. LMR-400 is a trademark of Times Microwave. Other companies making equivalent cable give it other names, like “ABC-400.” I asked if this was actual Times Microwave cable, and got a somewhat equivocal answer, so I suspect it is not. But it feels solid, looks well made, and the ends are nicely sealed, so I have no problem using it in my station"

The long overall length of the cord allows you to reach out to far away electrical devices and then the branches allow you to run a sealed extension of the same cord to other devices. I was previously running multiple cords across the wet lawn to power up all my decorations. This cord is only 16 gauge wire, so it is limited to 13 amps. This isn't an issue when all you are doing is powering yard decorations or lighting, but be aware that it is not suitable for running power tools or higher amperage devices. The female ends have LED lighting for ease of confirming there is power to the cord ends. They also supply \"caps\" for the female ends that are meant to keep out dust/dirt but would not be considered watertight. I am looking forward to next year when I can put all my decorations out and only run a single extension cord!! Definitely worth a look.",
        "<b>Great outdoor extensions cord for lights, decorations, and more!</b> I really like the balance this strikes between hefty and flexible. It feels like it will withstand years of providing power to outdoor lights, decorations, and even the occasional combination of saw, light, and battery charger, or just about anything else. The cord I got is 75 feet long, and then splits off into three separate 8 foot sections, each with a glowing outlet and seal at the end. The fact that they glow is so convenient for finding the end in the grass. The seal on the end means that you don't have to actually utilize all three of the ends for it to be weather protected. While I might not try to power three high-amp devices at the same time with this, that should be a given, as it only plugs into one, presumably 15 amp, outlet. I highly recommend this indoor/outdoor extension cord!"

If you need to run a cable outdoors, do yourself a favor and get the right wire to do the job. Nothing worse than trying to save money only to have something short (or catch fire) on something cheaper. This is worth the price for what it does...",
        "<b>Good quality wire.</b> I used some of this wire for an indoor 12V DC project. This wire was a little overkill for my needs. But this review is about the wire itself, not what I used it for. The wire is good quality and supple so easy to bend around corners. The jacket is about the thickness I expected for an outdoor wire that can be buried. I would not hesitate to use this buried for low voltage lights. The strands seem uniform in diameter when stripped. I've wired many outlets and lights in mine and others homes over the years. I'm also a retired IT tech so I have worked with large to small wires. The price seems about average for this size of outdoor wire. This is a good quality wire and I would not hesitate to buy more of this if needed in the future."

        "<b>Quality 3-Conductor Wire For DC Current Projects!</b> If you are a builder of DC current projects this 3-conductor pvc jacketed wire will come in handy!

This stuff is perfect for 5-Volt, 12-Volt, 24-Volt DC project, subject to amperage requirements, length of run, etc!",

        "<b>Great Quality. Low Price.</b> Thirty feet of power and ground for a good price. The insulation is thick but flexible (no word on if it is toxic if it burns). However, this is good line for all weather outdoor use. On/in/under a vehicle, and is going to handle friction and stretching well. It is UL2464 Complaint, which means in a nutshell: It’s certified safe as an “external interconnect cable”. AKA: You’re alright using this outside; even burying it underground. The wire jackets/sheathing itself are robust and flexible as with the primary jacket/sheath. It also has a good bit of copper (tin also) in its makeup. This on paper and upon observation this is very good wire. I wouldn’t use it to jump a car battery, or wire up a competition car audio system (been there, done that, and was a garage manager) but low power on/off applications in all weather environments, you’re going to be just fine. I only wish I could have gotten a larger roll. I’d recommend it. Seems better than the line contractors installed underground for our underground sprinkler system.",
        "<b>Round vs. flat insulation</b> This is a well made cable for landscape lighting. This means it can be buried directly for low voltage (24v) applications. The round insulation is nice because it seals with the various panel and hub grommets in my system. The negative is that I need to use a knife to slit the insulation instead of just pulling it apart. I'm OK with it because I want more water resistance than ease of jacket slitting. Good stuff and a decent price.",

Without this extension cord, I would have to plug a splitter into the outlet, then plug individual extension cords into the splitter. This extension cord consolidates 3 separate extension cords plus the splitter into one unit. While not my expertise, the cord appears to be made out of heavy-duty material. Each plug has an attached cover to keep moisture out of the plug when not in use (e.g., when you are only using 2 out of 3 plugs). The light on each plug lets you know it has power. Its long length makes it convenient for outdoor use when your electrical items (in my case, Christmas inflatables and lights) are a distance from the outlet. The splitter is about 7 feet from the end of the cord, so the 3 items you plug in need to be within 14 feet of each other (7 feet one direction, 7 feet the other direction). I was originally going to rate this 4 out of 5 stars because I needed a bit more than those 14 feet, but, in retrospect, 14 feet is pretty generous."

The long overall length of the cord allows you to reach out to far away electrical devices and then the branches allow you to run a sealed extension of the same cord to other devices. I was previously running multiple cords across the wet lawn to power up all my decorations. This cord is only 16 gauge wire, so it is limited to 13 amps. This isn't an issue when all you are doing is powering yard decorations or lighting, but be aware that it is not suitable for running power tools or higher amperage devices. The female ends have LED lighting for ease of confirming there is power to the cord ends. They also supply \"caps\" for the female ends that are meant to keep out dust/dirt but would not be considered watertight. I am looking forward to next year when I can put all my decorations out and only run a single extension cord!! Definitely worth a look."

The cable is nicely built and has lit outlets. The lit outlets are useful to know if this is plugged in or not. The length and multi ends are useful for hooking up my table saw and shop vac. My table saw and shop vac consume about 5 amps a piece. This cable is 16AWG with a multi-core conductors. If this were made with solid core conductors then the max suggested amperage would 15 amps, but using multi-core reduces the max suggested amperage between 6-10 amps since you are losing surface area between each core. The more cores the less max amperage. I would not suggest to use this extension with more then 10 amps of current.

After spending several days fighting and troubleshooting a brand new PC system build running a new installation of Windows 10 and nVidia drivers with another brand (and much more expensive) DP adapter that had all 3 kinds of other monitor jacks (and an audio out jack too) that I couldn't get to be detected by Windows I decided to try 2 different types of DP adapters (also different brands), one DP to VGA, one DP to HDMI, and both of them are fully detected and work as expected on the exact same system that the other brand of 3-in-1 DP adapter did not work on at all. I just got this adapter today so I can't say how long it might last but after several days of fighting with a 3-in-1 DP adapter of a different brand with no joy at all I now have one VGA monitor plugged into a DP port with this DP adapter and an HDMI monitor plugged into another DP port through a totally different brand and model of adapter with the latest nVidia driver loaded in the latest version of Windows 10 with a dual monitor extended desktop on my brand new PC build system and it all finally works. So a huge thumbs up to this DP adapter for solving several days of frustration with a different adapter!"

Bought a new monitor, thinking that was the problem. Swapped out the VGA cable. Tested PC output on different monitor and finally realized it was this adapter. Too late to return that time. Bought Moread brand and had no problems at all. So now, a week ago bought the three-pack of this EEEkit brand, thinking that all the regulatory approvals printed on it and gold contacts meant it should be good. Wrong. Same image problems. Forgot about before, and replaced the new computer thinking it was the video output. Finally isolated to the adapter as the only thing not tested and replaced. Yep. It's these stinking EEEkit adapter again. Just ordered a 5-pack of the Moread brand. Enough is enough. Very frustrating. Lost lots of time troubleshooting.

I spent more on cheap cables trying to get my HTC Vive Cosmos VR system to work on my current HDMI gaming PC rig, then I would have had I just bought this cable in this cable first place. My PC video card has two HDMI ports and with this cable I am able to still use the monitor as needed but also use the VR headset from the second port with no issues. All data and transmissions work as intended with no issues. With VR systems and conversion cables it is a serious hit and miss. I've read many forums and ordered many cheap cables and either they flat out do not do what they claim or the video is blurry or downright grainy. I am no video expert and opted to purchase the Club 3D CAC-1335 HDMI 2.1 to DisplayPort 1.4 4K120Hz or 8K30Hz M/F Active Adapter and it allows me to do VR at 90hz as it should, and I can still use my gaming monitor at 1080p (my prefered choice) at 120hz with no issues. Spend a few extra bucks up front and get the right cable with less hassle and headaches."

        "<b>Works for Xbox series X (sometimes)</b> When I first plugged in the HDMI cable from my Xbox Series X into this adapter and the display showed up with \"supports 120FPS\" on my Dell 1440p 144hz monitor I was super excited. However after about 10-15 minutes of gameplay the display would lose connection. At first I thought it was a power issue since I had it plugged in to one of the Xbox USB ports in the back but even after switching it to a fully powered USB port I still had the issue. Because having the display randomly lose connection to the monitor isn't the ideal situation for playing games like Apex Legends or Halo I ended up returning it. 😅"

With this, I can put my Apple cable back in my desk drawer and charge both of my phones, my tablet, and my laptop without ever needing another cable. I'm surprised this works at 5A, but since it does, I can charge my Samsung at 45W and my laptop at full 100W by just flipping the cable ends off to the side. While I am a bit worried the cable could get broken when the ends are opened, I think it's still a fine cable that solves my problems. I've used it for about a week with no durability issues, and it even comes with a velcro strap that matches the cable's color (green in my case) and a cloth bag to keep the cable in. This is really a 10/10 product that is so underrated, since I own 2 phones, a tablet, and a USB-C capable laptop, and this cable can substitute for all of them. Buy one, if not two, since these will solve all your connector problems. These cables also have data pins. While it's not thunderbolt 4, the data pins in these cables can transfer your photos and other important files, so you don't even need to worry about getting a separate cable for that!

        "<b>Versatile multi-purpose cable for Apple, Android and PC devices</b> Note: This item was sent as part of the Vines review program at no charge. However this review is unbiased and based solely on my experience with the product as received. Upon receiving the cable, I examined the box it came in. On the front of the box it is described as being 1500 mm in length. On the rear of the box, it is described as being 2000 mm in length, as shown in the included images. I measured the cable using a tape measure and the cable is indeed 1500 mm or 1.5 meters in length, not including the extra tips on each end. The cable is a solidly constructed green cable with black and clear color plastic on either end of the cable. It is essentially a USB-C to USB-C power and data cable with a USB-A extension on one end and an Apple compatible Lightning connector on the other. The box also contains a string pouch to store and protect the cable, a nice touch in my opinion. I tested the cable with a Pixel 7, an iPad Mini 4, a MacBook Air M1 and a PC running Windows 11. Data file transfers were flawless and fast. A 200 MB pdf file transferred from PC to Android in about 10 seconds. The iPad connected and synced with the MacBook air flawlessly. I also tested charging using a 65 watt USB C charger. The Pixel reported fast charging when connected. The iPad charged successfully. The photos in the review were uploaded to a PC using the USB A connector to a USB hub. Mechanically the cable worked as advertised. I intend to use this cable extensively since it is so versatile. My only concerns were I wonder how sturdily the Lightning and USB tips are attached and I noticed that the Lighting adapter didn't fit as snugly as the other tips did. I also would be hesitant to order this if I was using thick cases for my equipment due to the large size of the cable adapter ends. They might have difficulty fitting if the port opening on the case was too narrow. I did not experience any issues and recommend this cable for anyone currently carrying around a multitude of different cables to connect various tech items. Data transfer and charging both worked well and this will be part of my EDC going forward."

The semi hardest part was actually installing an update required for my printer, but that's only because Creality's website wasn't clear where I needed to go and the instruction booklet link wasn't correct. A quick google search solved that, downloaded it to an SD card and put it in my printer, turned it on, and it automatically installed the new firmware for the touch.

        "<b>I do not like the sleeve on the wire</b> I originally bought this for Automotive wiring, It's not great for that. It's Aluminum wiring, and the Sleeve around the wire is gross and gum like. It's not great to cut, but it did work as wire.",
        "<b>Awesome!</b> Can't begin to say how much better my electical system is doing with just the 2 negative wire's hooked up. Sadly, whoever put on the positive wire for the alternator overtightened the little nut, and stripped it. Not only that, it's partially welded to the bolt with thread's AND the positive terminal. So what could've been a simple unbolt like the other 2 wire's, now i have to remove the entire belt, unbolt an engine mount, shift my whole engine forward, take apart half the top of my engine, take out a specific bolt, unbolt the alternator, then i'll just cut the thing off. I was under my car for 5 hour's yesterday specifically trying to get that one nut off. Other 2 wire's i got done in about 15 minute's. I'd recommend, but if you ain't got the proper crimper to finish the wire's, you ain't doing this job. I had to make do with a pair of Husky plier's, vice grip's, and my meaty forearm's lol."

First couple times used it with iPhone to listen to music on phone. Sound was good but car screen blinked (never did that before with old cable). Next few times used it with new USB C iphone. Worked okay but it would not charge the phone. Again, old cable worked fine. Tried to charge with another USB C device, same thing, would not charge. Something is faulty with the cable. Not sure if it is design or this one is a lemon."

        "<b>Nice cable for light use</b> I used these cables across a variety of use cases. Two of them went to my children and their iPads. These cables are used HEAVILY with lots of opportunity to stress the cables. One cable was used in my Jeep as a charger while driving and one was used intermittently in a variety of situations. 3 of the 4 cables failed within the first 3 months requiring replacement. After two of the replacements failed in the iPads, I chose to stop using the cables unless on very light duty (table top in a controlled setting). The cables appear to be constructed well and the primary failure on all of the cables was the actual part of the plug that had the lightning connector itself on it. The plastic itself is very durable yet soft and the cable itself has a pleasing design and color."

The cable is nicely built and has lit outlets. The lit outlets are useful to know if this is plugged in or not. The length and multi ends are useful for hooking up my table saw and shop vac. My table saw and shop vac consume about 5 amps a piece. This cable is 16AWG with a multi-core conductors. If this were made with solid core conductors then the max suggested amperage would 15 amps, but using multi-core reduces the max suggested amperage between 6-10 amps since you are losing surface area between each core. The more cores the less max amperage. I would not suggest to use this extension with more then 10 amps of current.

This can be used indoors or outdoors, although if you will use it during rain, then you need to take measures to keep the ends dry. Again, the manufacturer tells you this. Having destroyed some other extensions with electric hedge trimmers (which is why I now use a battery powered one), this is a nice addition to the garage. Happy with the item.",
