I have 30+ of them integrated with HomeKit. Initially had an issue with them sporadically being 'No Response' in HomeKit, but this resolved when I changed my network (from Orbi to Unifi). Tread carefully in the Leviton early access Matter program if you are into that sort of thing. My one complaint with Leviton is that their iOS app currently does not directly integrate with HomeKit; you have to add the device to both (if you want firmware updates from Leviton). Also which they would just adopt Thread...would be a game changer.CHECK PRICING AT HOME DEPOT. I have purchased a bunch of these from Amazon and realized too late that: i) Home Depot has the same switch for $10 less (based on pricing I am seeing today); and ii) the Home Depot packaging includes color change plates, which are $5-$8 a each on Amazon.###check<3:8>|home<9:13>|depot<14:19>|home depot<9:19>|pricing<20:27>|integrate<65:74>|integrate<65:75>|home<81:85>|homekit<81:88>|initially<90:99>|an issue<104:112>|issue<107:112>|response<146:154>|no response<143:154>|home<159:163>|homekit<159:166>|resolve<177:185>|change<193:199>|change<193:200>|network<204:211>|orbi<218:222>|carefully<240:249>|leviton<257:264>|early<265:270>|access<271:277>|early access<265:277>|matter<278:284>|program<285:292>|sort<314:318>|complaint<336:345>|leviton<351:358>|currently<381:390>|directly<400:408>|integrate<409:418>|home<424:428>|homekit<424:431>|add<445:448>|device<453:459>|firmware<481:489>|firmware update<481:497>|update<490:497>|leviton<503:510>|thread<546:552>|game<566:570>|a game<564:570>|change<571:577>|check<579:584>|pricing<585:592>|home<596:600>|home depot<596:606>|depot<601:606>|bunch<627:632>|a bunch<625:632>|realize<658:666>|late<671:675>|home<685:689>|depot<690:695>|home depot<685:695>|same<704:708>|less<724:728>|base<730:735>|pricing<739:746>|today<759:764>|home<779:783>|depot<784:789>|home depot<779:789>|packaging<790:799>|include<800:808>|color<809:814>|change<815:821>|late<823:827>|plate<822:828>|each<848:852>",

The integration with Alexa and the Kasa app were simple.Short story: worst customer service ever.Longer story below:So why 1 star you ask?Well, this has to be the worst customer service experience I have ever had. Within a month one of the 4 switches we purchased started to malfunction. It does not dim properly or work with Alexa (aka wife is NOT happy that her husband bought 4 switches and one is not working).  So the product has a two year warranty, awesome! Or so I thought. After an extremely long conversation with customer service (one of many for at least five hours) I was told I had to register my product. Should have taken five minutes to say please register, we do not see the SN.After a lengthy online chat they finally were able to understand the serial numbers were not showing in their system. After they finally manually input them our their end am I able to register them on my side, took two hours for this to take place.Now it gets better.....person on chat is ready to process return and says (types) just take it of the wall and send it to us, then we ship you a new one.  What? You want me to take it out and send it to you?Yes, just take it out, pay the shipping and when we receive it we will ship a new one.They wanted me to pay for shipping, leave the lights unable to turn on or off or buy a new light switch as i wait for them to send the faulty one back.After explaining my lights will not work without a switch and also have live wires exposed ( yes i would cover them) I was told to just kill the breaker and leave it off. Yes I was told to kill a breaker and leave it off.I felt like David Spade in TommY Boy...So then I am told they can send me one with a hold of $25.99. Makes sense if I want my lights to work to send me a switch for a hold fee then remove the hold and refund once they receive the faulty switch. I was like perfect that makes sense. Agent: that will be $14.99 for standard shipping?Wait, my switch is 30 days old and under a 2 year warranty. You want me to pay $15 to ship me a new switch because you sold me a defective switch?Long story long, another hour and conversation with a supervisor to get them to pay for shipping.Worst service ever!!!###bad customer<3:17>|customer<9:17>|customer service<9:25>|service<18:25>|bad customer service<3:25>|ever<26:30>|overall<35:42>|function<70:79>|properly<80:88>|integration<94:105>|alexa<111:116>|integration with alexa<94:116>|kasa<125:129>|kasa app<125:133>|the kasa app<121:133>|simple<139:145>|short<146:151>|story<152:157>|customer<165:173>|bad customer<159:173>|customer service<165:181>|service<174:181>|bad customer service<159:181>|ever<182:186>|long<187:193>|story<194:199>|1 star<213:219>|bad customer<253:267>|customer<259:267>|bad customer service<253:275>|customer service<259:275>|service<268:275>|experience<276:286>|ever<294:298>|month<313:318>|one<319:322>|start<354:361>|malfunction<365:376>|dim<390:393>|properly<394:402>|alexa<416:421>|wife<427:431>|happy<439:444>|husband<454:461>|one<484:487>|year<531:535>|two year<527:535>|year warranty<531:544>|warranty<536:544>|extremely<581:590>|long<591:595>|customer<614:622>|service<623:630>|customer service<614:630>|one<632:635>|least<651:656>|hour<662:666>|hour<662:667>|old<676:679>|register<689:697>|minute<733:740>|register<755:763>|online<802:808>|chat<809:813>|online chat<802:813>|finally<819:826>|able<832:836>|understand<840:850>|serial<855:861>|the serial number<851:869>|serial number<855:869>|number<862:869>|show<879:886>|system<896:902>|finally<915:922>|manually<923:931>|end<953:956>|able<962:966>|register<970:978>|side<990:994>|hour<1005:1009>|hour<1005:1010>|place<1028:1033>|now<1034:1037>|person<1057:1063>|chat<1067:1071>|ready<1075:1080>|process<1084:1091>|turn<1094:1098>|return<1092:1098>|type<1109:1114>|wall<1136:1140>|send<1145:1149>|end<1146:1149>|ship<1168:1172>|new<1179:1182>|one<1183:1186>|a new one<1177:1186>|new one<1179:1186>|send<1226:1230>|end<1227:1230>|pay<1264:1267>|ship<1272:1276>|shipping<1272:1280>|receive<1293:1300>|ship<1312:1316>|new<1319:1322>|one<1323:1326>|a new one<1317:1326>|new one<1319:1326>|pay<1345:1348>|ship<1353:1357>|shipping<1353:1361>|leave<1363:1368>|unable<1380:1386>|able<1382:1386>|turn<1390:1394>|new<1414:1417>|wait<1436:1440>|end<1454:1457>|send<1453:1457>|faulty<1462:1468>|one<1469:1472>|back<1473:1477>|explain<1484:1494>|live<1550:1554>|wire<1555:1560>|cover<1583:1588>|old<1602:1605>|kill<1614:1618>|breaker<1623:1630>|leave<1635:1640>|old<1660:1663>|kill<1667:1671>|breaker<1674:1681>|leave<1686:1691>|feel<1701:1705>|old<1752:1755>|end<1766:1769>|send<1765:1769>|one<1773:1776>|hold<1784:1788>|old<1785:1788>|sense<1806:1811>|end<1844:1847>|send<1843:1847>|hold<1866:1870>|old<1867:1870>|fee<1871:1874>|remove<1880:1886>|hold<1891:1895>|old<1892:1895>|refund<1900:1906>|receive<1917:1924>|faulty<1929:1935>|sense<1974:1979>|standard<2012:2020>|ship<2021:2025>|shipping<2021:2029>|30 day<2049:2056>|day<2052:2056>|old<2057:2060>|year<2075:2079>|2 year<2073:2079>|warranty<2080:2088>|year warranty<2075:2088>|pay<2105:2108>|ship<2116:2120>|new<2126:2129>|sell<2149:2153>|old<2150:2153>|defective<2159:2168>|story<2181:2186>|long<2187:2191>|hour<2201:2205>|a supervisor<2228:2240>|supervisor<2230:2240>|pay<2256:2259>|ship<2264:2268>|shipping<2264:2272>|service<2279:2286>|ever<2287:2291>"

The switch has only two pigtail wires and they are for common and ground. The load and line wires are screwed into terminals. I would have liked the option to have a ground screw terminal also. Less wires in the outlet box makes for an easier installation.Speaking of installation, that was simple and straight forward. Turn off you power at the breaker, test the line an install like a pro. Took me about 5 minutes to install, was going for record, just wanted to make sure it was done right. If the switch is in a multi-gang box and you are reusing your existing faceplate, then you might want to file down the bottom of the opening on the faceplate to allow access to the restart and reset button. It is a tight squeeze without trimming the faceplate and the buttons would not move to either position. I filed about 1mm off to make sure it fit properly.Once I had everything put back together it was time to connect it Kasa app, Home Assistant, Google Home and Amazon Alexa. It was simple to set-up Google Home and then share it with Home Assistant, but not so much with Amazon Alexa. I spent hours trying different configurations to share it with Amazon Alexa but it failed every time. The only way to set them up on all devices is to install on Amazon Alexa separately. All other devices can be installed and shared with Google Home. Once everything was setup all voice commands and automations are working perfectly. Given time Amazon will improve their matter support for device sharing.###first<3:8>|kasa<9:13>|matter<14:20>|device<21:27>|first<44:49>|matter<50:56>|smart<57:62>|device<63:69>|wifi<108:112>|zigbee<114:120>|z wave<125:131>|wave<127:131>|device<132:138>|device<132:139>|now<144:147>|test<160:164>|kasa<174:178>|kasa smart<174:184>|smart<179:184>|dimmer<185:191>|kasa smart dimmer<174:191>|smart dimmer<179:191>|matter<192:198>|packaging<207:216>|less<227:231>|material<240:248>|compare<249:257>|smart<273:278>|device<279:285>|other smart device<267:286>|device<279:286>|plus<293:297>|wire<330:334>|nut<335:339>|wire nut<330:339>|screw<341:346>|screw<341:347>|face<349:353>|plate<354:359>|face plate<349:359>|attach<360:368>|instruction<370:382>|qr<389:391>|qr code<389:396>|code<392:396>|a qr code<387:396>|sticker<397:404>|device<413:419>|number<453:459>|device<467:473>|qr<482:484>|code<485:489>|the qr code<478:489>|qr code<482:489>|number<490:496>|enter<500:505>|manually<506:514>|pigtail<540:547>|wire<548:552>|wire<548:553>|common<571:577>|ground<582:588>|load<594:598>|line<603:607>|wire<608:612>|wire<608:613>|screw<618:623>|screw<618:625>|terminal<631:639>|terminal<631:640>|option<665:671>|ground<682:688>|screw<689:694>|screw terminal<689:703>|terminal<695:703>|less<710:714>|wire<715:719>|wire<715:720>|outlet<728:734>|outlet box<728:738>|box<735:738>|easy<752:758>|install<759:766>|easy installation<752:771>|installation<759:771>|speak<772:780>|install<784:791>|installation<784:796>|simple<807:813>|straight<818:826>|forward<827:834>|turn<836:840>|power<849:854>|breaker<862:869>|test<871:875>|line<880:884>|install<888:895>|pro<903:906>|5 minute<922:931>|minute<924:931>|install<935:942>|multi<1032:1037>|gang<1038:1042>|a multi gang<1030:1042>|multi gang<1032:1042>|multi gang box<1032:1046>|gang box<1038:1046>|box<1043:1046>|exist<1072:1080>|face<1081:1085>|faceplate<1081:1090>|plate<1085:1090>|file<1115:1119>|bottom<1129:1135>|face<1158:1162>|faceplate<1158:1167>|plate<1162:1167>|allow<1171:1176>|access<1177:1183>|restart<1191:1198>|set<1205:1208>|reset<1203:1208>|button<1209:1215>|reset button<1203:1215>|tight<1225:1230>|trim<1247:1255>|face<1260:1264>|faceplate<1260:1269>|plate<1264:1269>|button<1278:1284>|button<1278:1285>|move<1296:1300>|position<1311:1319>|file<1323:1327>|file<1323:1328>|fit<1359:1362>|pro<1363:1366>|properly<1363:1371>|once<1372:1376>|put<1394:1397>|together<1403:1411>|connect<1427:1434>|kasa<1438:1442>|kasa app<1438:1446>|home<1448:1452>|home assistant<1448:1462>|assistant<1453:1462>|google<1464:1470>|google home<1464:1475>|home<1471:1475>|amazon alexa<1480:1492>|alexa<1487:1492>|simple<1501:1507>|set<1511:1514>|google<1518:1524>|home<1525:1529>|google home<1518:1529>|share<1539:1544>|home<1553:1557>|home assistant<1553:1567>|assistant<1558:1567>|amazon alexa<1590:1602>|alexa<1597:1602>|spend<1606:1611>|hour<1612:1617>|different<1625:1634>|configuration<1635:1649>|share<1653:1658>|amazon alexa<1667:1679>|alexa<1674:1679>|fail<1687:1693>|every time<1694:1704>|set<1722:1725>|device<1741:1747>|device<1741:1748>|install<1755:1762>|alexa<1773:1778>|amazon alexa<1766:1778>|separately<1779:1789>|device<1801:1807>|device<1801:1808>|install<1816:1823>|instal<1816:1825>|share<1830:1835>|share<1830:1836>|google<1842:1848>|home<1849:1853>|google home<1842:1853>|once<1855:1859>|set<1875:1878>|setup<1875:1880>|voice<1885:1890>|voice command<1885:1899>|command<1891:1899>|automation<1904:1915>|perfectly<1928:1937>|give<1939:1944>|pro<1964:1967>|improve<1962:1969>|matter<1976:1982>|support<1983:1990>|matter support<1976:1990>|device<1995:2001>"

The dimming capabilities and voice/remote control are pretty cool, but here are 4 problems;#1  - Even when set to \"instant on\", there is a delay.  This make you wonder if you properly hit the switch, and sometimes you hit it again, turning it off before it ever comes on.#2 - The switch is bulky, and it is not easy to cram it into old junction boxes, especially if there is much wiring in there.#3 - The depression switch doesn't move much, so there is no significant blind feedback as to whether you successfully hit the switch.  If you are fumbling in a dark room, or reaching around a corner, the old style up and down switch provides much better tactile feedback.#4 - When hitting the switch, you sometimes hit the dimming buttons instead.  They really should not have designed it so those button are adjacent.  You have to be looking squarely at the switch to accurately hit it.  This may sound like whiny complaint, but most people are accustomed to looking where they are walking and just hitting the switch using their peripheral vision.###problem<8:16>|able<38:42>|install<46:53>|trouble<76:83>|fully<92:97>|dim<110:117>|capability<118:130>|voice<135:140>|remote<141:147>|remote control<141:155>|control<148:155>|pretty<160:166>|cool<167:171>|problem<188:196>|set<213:216>|instant<221:228>|delay<245:250>|wonder<267:273>|properly<281:289>|hit<290:293>|sometimes<310:319>|hit<324:327>|again<331:336>|turn<338:345>|ever<363:367>|bulky<396:401>|easy<417:421>|old<438:441>|junction<442:450>|box<451:456>|junction box<442:456>|especially<458:468>|wiring<486:492>|move<537:541>|significant<563:574>|blind<575:580>|feedback<581:589>|fully<615:620>|successfully<608:620>|hit<621:624>|dark<663:667>|room<668:672>|dark room<663:672>|reach<677:685>|corner<695:701>|old<707:710>|style<711:716>|down<724:728>|provide<736:744>|feedback<765:773>|hit<784:787>|hit<784:791>|sometimes<808:817>|hit<818:821>|dim<826:833>|button<834:840>|button<834:841>|instead<842:849>|design<880:888>|button<901:907>|hit<983:986>|sound<1001:1006>|complaint<1018:1027>|most<1033:1037>|people<1038:1044>|walk<1086:1093>|hit<1103:1106>|hit<1103:1110>",

Or you might not even see the switch but physically you can decipher its control logic. Not this thing. It is completely flat and the light is nowhere near what you want to hit.

While some folks may not notice, to me it feels cheaply made and destined to get worse. I contacted TP-Link's email support via their website, expecting that since they have a 2-year warranty they would replace this with a unit that doesn't squeak. Expect slow response times from their support team, around 24 hours between replies even if you reply within minutes. I provided a video of the issue (also posted here) and the other info they asked for and they assure me it's normal. I replied back just to make sure I understood, and they have confirmed that the switches squeak due to the spring they use, and there's nothing they will do about it.Note that there are three hardware versions of this unit, and the version 1 was more solid, with no squeaking. They have since decided to cheap out on the hardware and versions 2 and 2.1 are known to squeak. I've started the return process to send mine back and I'll find a brand that makes higher quality hardware.###late<3:9>|version<10:17>|squeak<21:27>|squeaky<21:28>|company<30:37>|normal<50:56>|instal<75:84>|press<90:97>|give<116:121>|squeak<138:144>|sound<146:151>|notice<178:184>|feel<195:200>|cheap<201:206>|contact<243:252>|tp<253:255>|tp link<253:260>|link<256:260>|email<263:268>|support<269:276>|website<287:294>|2 year<329:335>|year<331:335>|year warranty<331:344>|warranty<336:344>|replace<356:363>|unit<376:380>|squeak<394:400>|slow<409:413>|response<414:422>|slow response<409:422>|response time<414:428>|support<440:447>|team<448:452>|support team<440:452>|hour<464:469>|reply<478:485>|reply<498:503>|minute<511:518>|provide<522:530>|video<533:538>|issue<546:551>|post<558:564>|info<585:589>|ask<595:600>|normal<629:635>|reply<639:646>|back<647:651>|understand<672:682>|confirm<698:707>|squeak<726:732>|spring<744:750>|note<803:807>|hardware<829:837>|version<838:845>|hardware version<829:846>|version<838:846>|unit<855:859>|version<869:876>|solid<888:893>|squeak<903:909>|decide<930:937>|cheap<941:946>|hardware<958:966>|version<971:978>|version<971:979>|squeak<1003:1009>|start<1016:1023>|return<1028:1034>|return process<1028:1042>|process<1035:1042>|send<1046:1050>|back<1056:1060>|find<1070:1074>|brand<1077:1082>|high<1094:1100>|high quality<1094:1108>|hardware<1109:1117>",

This one is press just a bit kinda thing. I was delighted though about how dim it could be set as a minimum for Incandescent bulbs. I have it working in conjunction with the regular on/off version and it's nice how they integrate. Although when setting them up with Alexa, in the app everything gets mashed in the same place and although you pick which Echo is the source of the commands, if other devices are named the same or similarly, you'll get backtalk from \"Her\". This is mainly an Alexa problem. But something to be aware of.The only negative, is that you can set the Dim and Brighten Ramp Rate for other functions, but it does not apply to when you are asking \"She who shall not be named\" to change the brightness. It just jumps to it. Like our last non-WiFi dimmers, a nice ramp up or down to the selected brightness or what the ramp that was set for the other functions would be nice. Matter of fact, I'm surprised those setting don't control the ramp rate across for all dimming and brightening.###different<12:21>|full<65:69>|move<77:83>|motion<84:90>|type<91:95>|unit<96:100>|one<107:110>|press<114:119>|kinda<131:136>|though<160:166>|dim<177:180>|set<193:196>|minimum<202:209>|incandescent<214:226>|incandescent bulb<214:232>|bulb<227:232>|regular<276:283>|version<291:298>|integrate<322:331>|rate<327:331>|though<335:341>|set<347:350>|set<347:354>|alexa<368:373>|same<416:420>|place<421:426>|though<433:439>|pick<444:448>|echo<455:459>|source<467:473>|command<481:489>|device<500:507>|name<512:517>|same<522:526>|mainly<581:587>|alexa<591:596>|problem<597:604>|aware<626:631>|negative<644:652>|set<670:673>|dim<678:681>|brighten<686:694>|ramp<695:699>|rate<700:704>|ramp rate<695:704>|function<715:724>|ask<764:770>|name<793:798>|change<803:809>|brightness<814:824>|jump<834:839>|last<856:860>|non<861:864>|wifi<865:869>|dim<870:873>|dimmer<870:877>|ramp<886:890>|down<897:901>|select<909:917>|brightness<918:928>|ramp<941:945>|set<955:958>|function<973:982>|matter<998:1004>|fact<1008:1012>|set<1034:1037>|set<1034:1041>|control<1048:1055>|ramp<1060:1064>|ramp rate<1060:1069>|rate<1065:1069>|dim<1085:1088>|dimming<1085:1092>",

      "Paddle switch###paddle<0:6>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★★☆ [2023-05-04] <b>Works Great With Apple HomeKit</b> I used this Leviton 2nd Generation D25HD Dimmer for a set of two lights above our TV set. Watched a YouTube video for wiring instructions and that part was pretty easy. Ran into a little trouble with the setup until I read somewhere that in a duel band wi-fi network, the 5GHz band needs to be turned off during the setup. This smart dimmer can only be set up with the single 2.4 GHz running. After the setup, you can safely turn both bands back on again. My network is a duel band mesh wi-fi network with 3 Deco S4 routers. The utility software for these routers can be used to turn individual bands off and on. I do not use Alexa nor have I required Leviton's tech support so cannot offer my opinion on those features. I really like this dimmer and have no problem recommending them for use with the Apple HomeKit.Update: After 6 months had an issue with the device dropping off line & needed to re-install it. Problems getting it back on HomeKit. Emailed support & the advice they offered me solved the problem.

      "Rocker momentary dual contact switch###rocker<0:6>|dual<17:21>|contact<22:29>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★★☆ [2024-06-07] <b>WAIT if you want full Matter support vs. this HomeKit native switch</b> It worked great for my HomeKit use.... ignore ALL of the Leviton instructions and just \"add accessory\" when you are in the room you want to add the switch to in the iOS \"Home\" app. You don't need to use the Leviton app, but you will be at version 1.4 of the firmware, which works fine. I did load up the Leviton app and run through the Leviton gauntlet to use the app WITHOUT creating an account by telling the Leviton app you just want to use with Apple HomeKit and Siri and NOT use it with other integrations tied to an account with Leviton. I say WAIT for full Matter support because once these are delivered with the Matter firmware, you will NOT have to create a Leviton account, which is currently required to install the early adopter Matter firmware. It makes sense that Leviton requires an account to install the Matter firmware because your account will save the all important Matter QR code that your device will be unusable without once you update to Matter. Eventually the Matter QR codes will be attached to the switch and it will not require fooling around with yet another app, just use your Matter controller and off you go.But for my current use, the HomeKit native use was great. The Leviton build is superior to my ReFoss, partly due to a \"rocker\" momentary dual contact switch vs. the ReFoss which has a single momentary contact that you press the bottom of the switch to both turn On and Off while the Leviton has the more natural press the top for on, the bottom for off. As an added benefit when wired 3 way, pressing the top will be ON vs. the normal problem with mechanical 3 way switches that flip back and forth between up/down for on/off.So far my economy Refoss has been fine, but I'd probably go with the tp-link tapo for an economy Matter over WiFi.I had a neutral wire to support the higher power use of a WiFi switch. This WiFi Leviton Decora is probably a step down from the Lutron Caseta, but simpler to use where I don't have a ZigBee or Lutron Clear Connect RF hub handy.###wait<3:7>|full<20:24>|matter<25:31>|matter support<25:39>|support<32:39>|home<49:53>|homekit<49:56>|native<57:63>|home<98:102>|homekit<98:105>|ignore<114:120>|leviton<132:139>|instruction<140:152>|add<163:166>|accessory<167:176>|room<198:202>|add<215:218>|home<245:249>|leviton<282:289>|leviton app<282:293>|the leviton app<278:293>|version<314:321>|firmware<333:341>|load<367:371>|leviton<379:386>|leviton app<379:390>|the leviton app<375:390>|run<395:398>|leviton<411:418>|create<451:459>|account<463:470>|an account<460:470>|leviton<486:493>|leviton app<486:497>|the leviton app<482:497>|apple<524:529>|home<530:534>|homekit<530:537>|apple homekit<524:537>|siri<542:546>|integration<573:585>|tie<586:590>|account<597:604>|an account<594:604>|leviton<610:617>|wait<625:629>|full<634:638>|matter<639:645>|support<646:653>|matter support<639:653>|matter<696:702>|matter firmware<696:711>|firmware<703:711>|the matter firmware<692:711>|create<734:740>|leviton<743:750>|account<751:758>|current<769:776>|currently<769:778>|require<779:786>|require<779:787>|install<791:798>|early<803:808>|matter<817:823>|matter firmware<817:832>|firmware<824:832>|sense<843:848>|leviton<854:861>|require<862:869>|require<862:870>|an account<871:881>|account<874:881>|install<885:892>|matter<897:903>|matter firmware<897:912>|firmware<904:912>|the matter firmware<893:912>|account<926:933>|save<939:943>|important<952:961>|matter<962:968>|qr<969:971>|qr code<969:976>|code<972:976>|device<987:993>|unusable<1002:1010>|update<1028:1034>|matter<1038:1044>|eventually<1046:1056>|matter<1061:1067>|qr<1068:1070>|qr code<1068:1075>|code<1071:1075>|code<1071:1076>|qr code<1068:1076>|attach<1085:1093>|require<1124:1131>|yet<1152:1155>|matter<1183:1189>|controller<1190:1200>|current<1227:1234>|home<1244:1248>|homekit<1244:1251>|native<1252:1258>|leviton<1278:1285>|build<1286:1291>|superior<1295:1303>|rocker<1335:1341>|dual<1353:1357>|contact<1358:1365>|single<1400:1406>|contact<1417:1424>|press<1434:1439>|bottom<1444:1450>|turn<1473:1477>|leviton<1499:1506>|press<1528:1533>|top<1538:1541>|bottom<1554:1560>|add<1576:1579>|add<1576:1581>|benefit<1582:1589>|wire<1595:1599>|wire<1595:1600>|3 way<1601:1606>|press<1608:1613>|press<1608:1616>|top<1621:1624>|normal<1644:1650>|problem<1651:1658>|mechanical<1664:1674>|3 way<1675:1680>|3 way switch<1675:1689>|flip<1695:1699>|back<1700:1704>|forth<1709:1714>|down<1726:1730>|far<1745:1748>|probably<1790:1798>|tp<1811:1813>|tp link<1811:1818>|the tp link<1807:1818>|link<1814:1818>|tapo<1819:1823>|matter<1839:1845>|wifi<1851:1855>|neutral<1864:1871>|wire<1872:1876>|neutral wire<1864:1876>|a neutral wire<1862:1876>|support<1880:1887>|high<1892:1898>|power<1899:1904>|wifi<1914:1918>|wifi<1932:1936>|leviton<1937:1944>|decora<1945:1951>|leviton decora<1937:1951>|probably<1955:1963>|step<1966:1970>|down<1971:1975>|lutron<1985:1991>|caseta<1992:1998>|lutron caseta<1985:1998>|simple<2004:2011>|zigbee<2040:2046>|lutron<2050:2056>|clear<2057:2062>|connect<2063:2070>|hub<2074:2077>|handy<2078:2083>",

It also has smart capabilities, which seem pretty functional.I've had Kasa (outlets), and they've always been pretty consistent with connectivity and response when using the native application.Since I had the app already and was familiar with it, setup was pretty simple. Just opened the app and added the appropriate switch. I was standing right next to the unit and had no problems connecting to it via bluetooth. The only complaint I have with these smart devices is that they are 2.4GHz only. Which means for multi-band networks, you sometimes have to shut off your 5GHz band to force them to 2.4GHz (Eero, I'm looking at you).Another complaint (about the interaction with these devices and the rest of your smart  home), is that the integration to Amazon Alexa is 'OK'. Sometimes the devices will drop off your groups / be unresponsive to your commands / completely fall off the skill list. This isn't entirely the fault of the device using the integration, but its worth mentioning that the issue still remains in lots of the ecosystems.Other than that, it looks good, feels good during operation and does everything I hoped it would. We'll see how time treats it for durability.###dim<14:17>|dimmer<14:20>|cheap<46:53>|regard<75:82>|place<88:93>|turn<97:101>|dim<115:118>|smart<146:151>|capability<152:164>|pretty<177:183>|functional<184:194>|kasa<204:208>|outlet<210:217>|always<232:238>|pretty<244:250>|consistent<251:261>|connectivity<267:279>|response<284:292>|native<308:314>|application<315:326>|already<347:354>|familiar<363:371>|setup<381:386>|pretty<391:397>|simple<398:404>|open<411:417>|add<430:435>|stand<466:474>|next<481:485>|unit<493:497>|no problem<506:517>|problem<509:517>|connect<518:528>|bluetooth<539:548>|only complaint<554:568>|complaint<559:568>|smart<587:592>|device<593:599>|device<593:600>|mean<637:642>|multi<647:652>|band<653:657>|network<658:666>|sometimes<672:681>|shut<690:694>|band<709:713>|force<717:722>|eero<739:743>|complaint<773:782>|device<817:823>|device<817:824>|rest<833:837>|the rest<829:837>|smart<846:851>|home<853:857>|smart home<846:857>|integration<872:883>|alexa<894:899>|amazon alexa<887:899>|sometimes<909:918>|device<923:929>|device<923:930>|drop<936:940>|group<950:956>|unresponsive<962:974>|command<983:991>|completely<994:1004>|fall<1005:1009>|skill<1018:1023>|list<1024:1028>|entirely<1041:1049>|fault<1054:1059>|device<1067:1073>|integration<1084:1095>|worth<1105:1110>|mention<1111:1121>|issue<1131:1136>|still<1137:1142>|remain<1143:1150>|ecosystem<1166:1176>|feel<1209:1214>|operation<1227:1236>|hope<1259:1264>|durability<1308:1318>",
      "Single paddle design###single<0:6>|paddle<7:13>|design<14:20>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2020-12-22] <b>Fantastic as long as you have a neutral wire</b> I am really loving Kasa's switches and plugs lately. I have 80-90% of my lighting automated now. I started out with a lot of Lutron's switches. They are very nice, but VERY expensive and they require a hub to work. I didn't try Kasa initially because the price was so low (especially when they put them on sale, which seems to happen frequently), that I thought they would be kind of junk.Turns out that is not the case at all. They have been great quality with a very nice app. In many respects they are better than the lutron switches. The design is nicer in my opinion, the single paddle is easier to use than the many little buttons on Lutron's. The paddle can be configured so that when you press and hold it, it turns the lights on to 100% or to a preset level, regardless of what the previous lighting level was (normally when you click it on it just goes to whatever level of lighting you left it at the last time).The reason I got it was that I replaced an overhead light fixture in my bathroom with a new LED one. It worked great with the standard, non-smart, dimmer I had. A little later I replaced it with a lutron dimmer and it would not dim to a low level without a TON of flickering. My wife really likes low light levels in there, so I decided to try the Kasa switch. It works perfect. Very, very low light level without any flicker.Just make sure you have a neutral wire in your box, it won't work without it. Usually the boxes do, but not all of them are wired that way. It's a big switch (as is the Lutron), so if the box is super tight, you might have to work a little to get the wires in there properly.###long<16:20>|neutral<35:42>|a neutral wire<33:47>|neutral wire<35:47>|wire<43:47>|all<59:62>|love<64:70>|kasa<71:75>|plug<91:96>|lighting<125:133>|automate<134:143>|now<144:147>|start<151:158>|lutron<177:183>|expensive<225:234>|require<244:251>|hub<254:257>|kasa<280:284>|all<290:293>|initially<285:294>|price<307:312>|low<320:323>|all<331:334>|especially<325:335>|put<346:349>|sale<358:362>|happen<379:385>|frequently<386:396>|kind<428:432>|junk<436:440>|turn<441:446>|case<467:471>|all<475:478>|lutron<573:579>|design<594:600>|opinion<616:623>|single<629:635>|paddle<636:642>|easy<646:652>|button<681:688>|lutron<692:698>|paddle<706:712>|configure<720:730>|press<748:753>|hold<758:762>|turn<770:775>|preset<806:812>|level<813:818>|regardless<820:830>|previous<843:851>|lighting<852:860>|level<861:866>|all<876:879>|normally<872:880>|click<890:895>|level<927:932>|lighting<936:944>|leave<949:953>|last<964:968>|reason<979:985>|replace<1006:1014>|overhead<1018:1026>|fixture<1033:1040>|light fixture<1027:1040>|bathroom<1047:1055>|new<1063:1066>|led<1067:1070>|standard<1101:1109>|non<1111:1114>|smart<1115:1120>|dim<1122:1125>|dimmer<1122:1128>|non smart dimmer<1111:1128>|smart dimmer<1115:1128>|later<1145:1150>|replace<1153:1161>|lutron<1172:1178>|dim<1179:1182>|lutron dimmer<1172:1185>|dimmer<1179:1185>|dim<1203:1206>|low<1212:1215>|level<1216:1221>|low level<1212:1221>|a ton<1230:1235>|ton<1232:1235>|flicker<1239:1246>|flickering<1239:1249>|wife<1254:1258>|all<1261:1264>|low<1272:1275>|level<1282:1287>|level<1282:1288>|decide<1304:1311>|kasa<1323:1327>|low<1365:1368>|level<1375:1380>|flicker<1393:1400>|neutral<1427:1434>|a neutral wire<1425:1439>|wire<1435:1439>|neutral wire<1427:1439>|box<1448:1451>|all<1482:1485>|usually<1479:1486>|box<1491:1494>|box<1491:1496>|all<1509:1512>|wire<1525:1529>|wire<1525:1530>|big<1548:1551>|lutron<1570:1576>|box<1589:1592>|super<1596:1601>|tight<1602:1607>|wire<1652:1656>|wire<1652:1657>|properly<1667:1675>"

So far 5 of my gen 1 Leviton switches have died after 5 years with the failures all being in the last year.The app and Apple home app can see and activate the switch but nothing happens. You can’t physically turn the switch on or off either. Cycling power at the breaker doesn’t fix it. The micro switches in the switch work because you can see the LED on the switch turn on and off but the relay in the switch that actually send power through won’t “click”. Going through the reset process and adding it to Apple home goes fine but the switch still doesn’t work so it’s some sort of hardware failure.I work on electronics by trade so replacing them only takes 10 minutes even though the design changed.

      "Relay###relay<0:5>|||B08RSM1KYN ★☆☆☆☆ [2022-06-20] <b>Unreliable connection to Wi-Fi, before relay died completely</b> Bought this switch because it was replacing a brown-colored simple switch and this has brown plates available.Installed it (with difficulty because it's so big and the box is an older metal one with not a ton of depth), got it set up, it was working.  But it would often quit responding to the Home app on my iPhone, requiring a reset.Worse, though, was that after a few months the relay died entirely.  If I turned it on from the switch itself or from the Home app, nothing would happen (not even the click of the relay).  Swapped it out for a meross which was cheaper, worked more consistently, and has not had any problems in any of my rooms yet.  I had bought one of these a few years earlier, and it had also had its relay die; I hoped things would have improved by now.###unreliable<3:13>|connection<14:24>|wi<28:30>|fi<31:33>|wi fi<28:33>|relay<42:47>|die<48:51>|die<48:52>|completely<53:63>|replace<102:111>|brown<114:119>|simple<128:134>|brown<155:160>|plate<161:167>|available<168:177>|instal<178:187>|difficulty<197:207>|big<224:227>|box<236:239>|old<246:251>|metal<252:257>|a ton<271:276>|ton<273:276>|depth<280:285>|set<295:298>|often<333:338>|quit<339:343>|respond<344:354>|home<362:366>|iphone<377:383>|require<385:394>|set<399:402>|reset<397:402>|though<410:416>|a few month<433:445>|few month<435:445>|month<439:445>|relay<450:455>|die<456:459>|die<456:460>|entirely<461:469>|turn<477:483>|home<525:529>|happen<549:555>|click<570:575>|relay<583:588>|swap<592:599>|meross<613:619>|cheap<630:637>|consistently<651:663>|problem<685:693>|any problem<681:693>|room<707:712>|yet<713:716>|a few year<745:756>|year<751:756>|few year<747:756>|early<757:764>|relay<790:795>|die<796:799>|hope<803:808>|improve<827:835>|now<839:842>",

The features of the devices at the price point made sense. At first they worked fantastic, but over time, they have each and every one failed, at first illiciting costly replacements, and eventually rendering the entire concept defunct.The culprit? Cheap mechanical relays used to accomplish the primary function of the device. Like the starter relays on older vehicles, these pieces of junk arc and oxidize over time and eventually get stuck, leaving you with an expensive and time consuming non-functional paper weight that you have to go to repeated and extensive trouble to replace.I highly recommend looking into something that employs a high-wear-tolerant solid state relay of some sort to provide the primary functionality of turning electricity on and off to the end device.In short, these things have one job. They will likely do it between five and five hundred times and then require replacement.###absolute<3:11>|garbage<12:19>|worth<21:26>|trash<33:38>|throw<50:55>|unit<87:92>|various<104:111>|fixture<112:120>|home<135:139>|feature<145:153>|device<161:167>|device<161:168>|price<176:181>|point<182:187>|price point<176:187>|sense<193:198>|first<203:208>|fail<276:282>|first<287:292>|replace<311:318>|replacement<311:322>|replacement<311:323>|eventually<329:339>|end<341:344>|render<340:349>|entire<354:360>|concept<361:368>|cheap<390:395>|mechanical<396:406>|relay<407:412>|relay<407:413>|accomplish<422:432>|primary<437:444>|function<445:453>|device<461:467>|relay<486:491>|relay<486:492>|old<496:501>|piece<518:524>|junk<528:532>|eventually<563:573>|stick<578:583>|leave<585:592>|expensive<605:614>|consume<624:633>|non<634:637>|function<638:646>|functional<638:648>|repeat<685:693>|trouble<708:715>|replace<719:726>|high<729:733>|highly<729:735>|end<742:745>|recommend<736:745>|high<784:788>|solid<803:808>|state<809:814>|relay<815:820>|sort<829:833>|provide<837:844>|primary<849:856>|function<857:865>|functional<857:867>|functionality<857:870>|turn<874:881>|electricity<882:893>|end<912:915>|device<916:922>|short<926:931>|job<955:958>|likely<970:976>|require<1028:1035>|replace<1036:1043>|replacement<1036:1047>",
      "Relay contact###relay<0:5>|contact<6:13>|||B079775ZZQ ★☆☆☆☆ [2024-07-21] <b>Gambling on potential to experience an unsafe failure mode of switches getting stuck on</b> I did not run into the issue until of course after I had swapped out most of my house with both the regular switch and the dimmer models. I have had a few of the switches fail in the exact same manner, and if you check the forums it is a pretty frequent occurrence for something as wild as an electrical switch that has the potential to fail in an ON state and be uncontrollable without turning off its breaker. if you want to verify how frequently the issue has occured just search the kasa forums for 'stuck' and that will bring up most of the examples. the usual TPlink forum responses blaming wiring even though most people are describing it has a failure after an installation has been working for some time. some of the threads go on for years. if you attempt to get the switch replaced under warranty they will walk you through the usual factory reset non-sense which doesn't do anything and the first time the switch powers back on it will again be stuck in an on position. If you reach their threshold to achieve their permission to return/replace the item they will of course ask for you to remove and ship the non-working one back before they dispatch the new one??? I would think a company would be more motivated to support getting something such as this engineered in an unsafe manner out of customer hands. There are a few people that have pointed out that hitting the switch harder a few times will sometimes cause the stuck contact on the relay to release, but this will stop working also after some time.###potential<15:24>|experience<28:38>|fail<49:53>|failure<49:56>|mode<57:61>|stick<82:87>|stuck<82:87>|run<105:108>|issue<118:123>|course<133:139>|swap<152:159>|most<164:168>|house<175:180>|regular<195:202>|dimmer<218:224>|mode<225:229>|model<225:231>|fail<266:270>|exact<278:283>|same<284:288>|check<308:313>|forum<318:323>|forum<318:324>|pretty<333:339>|frequent<340:348>|electrical<388:398>|potential<419:428>|fail<432:436>|state<446:451>|turn<482:489>|breaker<498:505>|verify<522:528>|frequent<533:541>|frequently<533:543>|issue<548:553>|occur<558:565>|search<571:577>|kasa<582:586>|forum<587:592>|forum<587:593>|stick<599:604>|stuck<599:604>|bring<620:625>|most<629:633>|example<641:649>|usual<655:660>|tplink<661:667>|forum<668:673>|response<674:683>|blame<684:691>|wiring<692:698>|most<711:715>|people<716:722>|describe<727:737>|fail<747:751>|failure<747:754>|installation<764:776>|working<786:793>|thread<821:828>|year<839:844>|attempt<853:860>|replace<879:886>|replace<879:887>|warranty<894:902>|walk<913:917>|usual<934:939>|factory<940:947>|factory reset<940:953>|reset<948:953>|non<954:957>|sense<958:963>|first<998:1003>|first time<998:1008>|the first time<994:1008>|power<1020:1026>|back<1027:1031>|again<1043:1048>|stuck<1052:1057>|stick<1052:1057>|position<1067:1075>|reach<1084:1089>|return<1137:1143>|replace<1144:1151>|course<1174:1180>|ask<1181:1184>|remove<1196:1202>|ship<1207:1211>|non<1216:1219>|working<1220:1227>|back<1232:1236>|new<1262:1265>|company<1289:1296>|support<1324:1331>|engineer<1363:1373>|customer<1401:1409>|hand<1410:1415>|people<1433:1439>|point<1450:1457>|hit<1467:1474>|hard<1486:1492>|sometimes<1510:1519>|cause<1520:1525>|stick<1530:1535>|stuck<1530:1535>|contact<1536:1543>|relay<1551:1556>|release<1560:1567>|stop<1583:1587>|working<1588:1595>"

So far 5 of my gen 1 Leviton switches have died after 5 years with the failures all being in the last year.The app and Apple home app can see and activate the switch but nothing happens. You can’t physically turn the switch on or off either. Cycling power at the breaker doesn’t fix it. The micro switches in the switch work because you can see the LED on the switch turn on and off but the relay in the switch that actually send power through won’t “click”. Going through the reset process and adding it to Apple home goes fine but the switch still doesn’t work so it’s some sort of hardware failure.I work on electronics by trade so replacing them only takes 10 minutes even though the design changed.

They were easy to install and look nice. However several times a week the dimmer gets into a bad state where the lights are on but the dimmer thinks they're off, or vice versa. Unfortunately this also breaks voice control via the Google Assistant, because you can't turn off lights that are already considered off. The only remedy is to manually toggle the lights. It's annoying. I keep the firmware up to date, and I don't think network connectivity is the issue, because the affected dimmers are right next to the router.My only other gripe is that the dimmers have a noticeable delay when turning on the lights. I configured the dimmers via the Kasa app to minimize the delay, but that didn't help.If I had to install smart dimmers in my home again, I'd probably pick a different brand.###buggy<31:36>|dimmer<63:69>|dimmer<63:70>|a few month<75:87>|month<81:87>|few month<77:87>|easy<99:103>|install<107:114>|however<130:137>|week<154:158>|dimmer<163:169>|state<186:191>|dimmer<224:230>|unfortunately<266:279>|break<290:296>|voice<297:302>|control<303:310>|voice control<297:310>|google<319:325>|assistant<326:335>|google assistant<319:335>|turn<355:359>|already<380:387>|consider<388:398>|manually<426:434>|toggle<435:441>|annoying<459:467>|keep<471:475>|firmware<480:488>|date<495:499>|network<519:526>|connectivity<527:539>|issue<547:552>|affect<566:574>|dimmer<575:581>|dimmer<575:582>|next<593:597>|router<605:611>|gripe<626:631>|dimmer<644:650>|dimmer<644:651>|noticeable<659:669>|noticeable delay<659:675>|a noticeable delay<657:675>|delay<670:675>|turn<681:685>|turn<681:688>|configure<706:716>|dimmer<721:727>|dimmer<721:728>|kasa<737:741>|kasa app<737:745>|the kasa app<733:745>|delay<762:767>|help<785:789>|install<802:809>|smart<810:815>|dimmer<816:822>|smart dimmer<810:823>|dimmer<816:823>|home<830:834>|again<835:840>|probably<846:854>|pick<855:859>|different<862:871>|brand<872:877>|different brand<862:877>|a different brand<860:877>"

      "Loud clicking of dim/brighten buttons###loud<0:4>|dim<17:20>|brighten<21:29>|button<30:37>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★☆☆ [2022-07-15] <b>Affordable way to add smart functionality to your lights</b> I was planning on replacing a dimmer switch in our master bathroom, but decided to get one of these Kasa smart dimmers since it was about the same price as a 'dumb' dimmer switch. We already have Philips Hue bulbs in our master bedroom, as that's the only place we really want smart bulbs. We have no real need for a smart switch in our master bathroom, but figured I'd give it a go due to the pricing. We would probably just use the actual switch for the bathroom lights, but maybe we'd grow to appreciate some of its smart functions.Pros:- Cheap, especially when on sale or when a coupon is available.- Installation is easy. Configuration via app is also easy.- Lights can be controlled by a physical switch, by smart speaker, or by app.- Works with dimmable LED bulbs, which are much cheaper than smart bulbs.- Some functions can be customized in the Kasa app. For example, you can set it up so a long press will slowly dim the lights over 10 seconds until it's off. Or double tap to turn on light instantly.Cons:- The switch takes a good second or so to respond which can be annoying. Press it to turn on, and you might start to walk away before realizing you didn't actually press the button all the way.- The dim/brighten buttons click loudly.- There are only seven preset brightness settings on the switch. This is where an analog dimmer wins. However, to be fair, you can adjust in 1% increments using the app, but I prefer not to have to use my phone for this.- Adjusting the brightness using the switch is slow if you need to dim or brighten significantly. A traditional analog dimmer wins here because the slider can be moved quickly.- If the dimmer setting is set too low before turning off the lights (below 25% in our case), the lights will not turn on. The lights do work at these dimmer settings, but only after setting them on at a higher brightness setting first. This is super annoying. We like to keep the dimmer setting set very low before going to bed so when we turn it on to go pee in the middle of the night, we are not blinded. Can't do it with this dimmer, as 25% is brighter than we like for this purpose.We have this dimmer set up to control two vanity sconces, each with two bulbs (four bulbs total). The bulbs we are using are the \"Philips LED Dimmable Warm Glow Effect\". These bulbs are fantastic as they get warmer at dimmer settings, similar to incandescent bulbs. Plus they work great with a traditional analog dimmer. I may try to swap them out with different bulbs just to see if it addresses any of my \"Cons\" above. I also might take out the Kasa switch in favor of an analog one and return the Kasa if these issues continue to bother us.Update: The switch has lost the wi-fi connection several times in the last few months. It's not that hard to reconnect it to wi-fi, but it's annoying. I am going to go back to an analog dimmer switch.###affordable<3:13>|add<21:24>|smart<25:30>|functionality<31:44>|plan<70:78>|replace<82:91>|dim<94:97>|dimmer<94:100>|wi<102:104>|master<115:121>|bathroom<122:130>|master bathroom<115:130>|decide<136:143>|kasa<164:168>|smart<169:174>|dim<175:178>|dimmer<175:181>|smart dimmer<169:182>|kasa smart dimmer<164:182>|dimmer<175:182>|same<206:210>|price<211:216>|dumb<223:227>|dim<229:232>|dimmer<229:235>|dumb dimmer<223:235>|wi<237:239>|already<247:254>|philips<260:267>|hue<268:271>|bulb<272:277>|master<285:291>|bed<292:295>|bedroom<292:299>|place<320:325>|real<329:333>|smart<341:346>|bulb<347:352>|real<365:369>|smart<381:386>|wi<388:390>|master<401:407>|bathroom<408:416>|master bathroom<401:416>|fi<422:424>|figure<422:429>|give<434:438>|pricing<458:465>|probably<476:484>|actual<498:504>|wi<506:508>|bathroom<520:528>|bathroom light<520:535>|appreciate<560:570>|smart<583:588>|function<589:598>|cheap<606:611>|especially<613:623>|sale<632:636>|installation<669:681>|easy<685:689>|fi<694:696>|configuration<691:704>|easy<721:725>|lights<728:734>|control<742:749>|control<742:752>|physical<758:766>|wi<768:770>|physical switch<758:773>|smart<778:783>|speaker<784:791>|smart speaker<778:791>|wi<811:813>|dim<816:819>|dimmable<816:824>|led<825:828>|lead<825:828>|dimmable led<816:828>|led bulb<825:834>|dimmable led bulb<816:834>|bulb<829:834>|cheap<851:858>|smart<864:869>|bulb<870:875>|function<883:892>|customize<900:910>|kasa<918:922>|the kasa app<914:926>|kasa app<918:926>|example<932:939>|set<949:952>|long<964:968>|long press<964:974>|press<969:974>|wi<975:977>|slow<980:984>|low<981:984>|slowly<980:986>|dim<987:990>|second<1010:1016>|second<1010:1017>|10 second<1007:1017>|double<1037:1043>|double tap<1037:1047>|tap<1044:1047>|turn<1051:1055>|instantly<1065:1074>|con<1075:1079>|wi<1087:1089>|second<1106:1112>|respond<1122:1129>|annoying<1143:1151>|press<1153:1158>|turn<1165:1169>|start<1188:1193>|walk<1197:1201>|away<1202:1206>|real<1214:1218>|realize<1214:1223>|actual<1235:1241>|actually<1235:1243>|press<1244:1249>|button<1254:1260>|dim<1279:1282>|brighten<1283:1291>|button<1292:1298>|button<1292:1299>|click<1300:1305>|preset<1336:1342>|set<1339:1342>|brightness<1343:1353>|set<1354:1357>|setting<1354:1361>|set<1354:1361>|setting<1354:1362>|brightness setting<1343:1362>|wi<1371:1373>|analog<1395:1401>|dim<1402:1405>|dimmer<1402:1408>|analog dimmer<1395:1408>|wi<1409:1411>|however<1415:1422>|fair<1430:1434>|adjust<1444:1450>|increment<1457:1467>|prefer<1489:1495>|phone<1518:1523>|adjust<1535:1544>|brightness<1549:1559>|wi<1571:1573>|low<1581:1584>|slow<1580:1584>|dim<1600:1603>|brighten<1607:1615>|fi<1621:1623>|significantly<1616:1629>|traditional<1633:1644>|analog<1645:1651>|dim<1652:1655>|dimmer<1652:1658>|analog dimmer<1645:1658>|wi<1659:1661>|slider<1681:1687>|move<1695:1700>|dim<1718:1721>|dimmer<1718:1724>|set<1725:1728>|set<1725:1732>|setting<1725:1732>|set<1736:1739>|low<1744:1747>|turn<1755:1759>|turn<1755:1762>|low<1781:1784>|case<1796:1800>|wi<1814:1816>|turn<1823:1827>|dim<1860:1863>|dimmer<1860:1866>|set<1867:1870>|set<1867:1874>|setting<1867:1874>|setting<1867:1875>|set<1892:1895>|set<1892:1899>|setting<1892:1899>|high<1913:1919>|brightness<1920:1930>|set<1931:1934>|setting<1931:1938>|set<1931:1938>|fi<1939:1941>|first<1939:1944>|super<1954:1959>|annoying<1960:1968>|keep<1981:1985>|dim<1990:1993>|dimmer<1990:1996>|set<1997:2000>|setting<1997:2004>|set<1997:2004>|set<2005:2008>|low<2014:2017>|bed<2034:2037>|turn<2049:2053>|middle<2077:2083>|the middle<2073:2083>|night<2091:2096>|blind<2109:2116>|wi<2130:2132>|dim<2140:2143>|dimmer<2140:2146>|bright<2158:2166>|purpose<2189:2196>|dim<2210:2213>|dimmer<2210:2216>|set<2217:2220>|control<2227:2234>|wi<2260:2262>|bulb<2269:2274>|bulb<2281:2286>|total<2287:2292>|bulb<2299:2304>|philips<2327:2334>|led<2335:2338>|lead<2335:2338>|dimmable<2339:2347>|warm<2348:2352>|low<2354:2357>|glow<2353:2357>|effect<2358:2364>|bulb<2373:2378>|warm<2405:2411>|dim<2415:2418>|dimmer<2415:2421>|set<2422:2425>|setting<2422:2429>|set<2422:2429>|setting<2422:2430>|similar<2432:2439>|incandescent<2443:2455>|bulb<2456:2461>|wi<2484:2486>|traditional<2491:2502>|analog<2503:2509>|dim<2510:2513>|analog dimmer<2503:2516>|dimmer<2510:2516>|swap<2531:2535>|wi<2545:2547>|different<2550:2559>|bulb<2560:2565>|add<2584:2587>|address<2584:2593>|con<2605:2609>|kasa<2644:2648>|wi<2650:2652>|analog<2671:2677>|turn<2688:2692>|return<2686:2692>|kasa<2697:2701>|issue<2711:2717>|continue<2718:2726>|bother<2730:2736>|update<2740:2746>|wi<2753:2755>|lose<2763:2767>|wi<2772:2774>|wi fi<2772:2777>|fi<2775:2777>|the wi fi<2768:2777>|fi connection<2775:2788>|connection<2778:2788>|wi fi connection<2772:2788>|last<2810:2814>|few month<2815:2825>|month<2819:2825>|hard<2841:2845>|reconnect<2849:2858>|wi<2865:2867>|wi fi<2865:2870>|fi<2868:2870>|annoying<2881:2889>|back<2908:2912>|analog<2919:2925>|dim<2926:2929>|dimmer<2926:2932>|analog dimmer<2919:2932>|wi<2934:2936>",
      "Loud relay/contactor when turning on/off###loud<0:4>|relay<5:10>|turn<26:33>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★★☆ [2023-11-28] <b>Amazing, almost perfect</b> This is fantastic concept and clears up so much space for areas where you don't want a bulky smart plug connected. We're personally using it in our kitchen near the end of the counter. The bottom plug is for the always on coffee machine and the top plug (the smart outlet section) is for the Christmas season when we run Christmas Lights up on top of the cabinet. It's perfectly located to allow us to run a flat plugged extension chord up to the top of the cabinets between the wall and the open gap from the cabinet.The outlet itself was very easy to install...like a typical receptacle and I love that it uses the compression style crimps on the sides of the receptacle where you don't need to \"hook/loop\" the conductor cables. It's the standard size for GFCI receptacle so it fits just fine into the box. The reactive speed when using Apples Homekit to turn it on and off is near instant, and the button in the middle for manual control of the top section is easy to use.There are only a few things I wish I could change about this receptacle:1) Make it so both Plugs can be controlled, not just the top half.2) Use a quieter relay...The contactor is LOUD when it turns on/off....almost comically loud....I'm honestly surprised Leviton was okay with this.3) Thread connectivity would also be fantastic to have built into these receptacles to help strengthen the connection for multiple receptacles and other devices using the Thread protocol.If all 3 of my changes could be incorporated. I would throw money at this product in a very irrespirable way. There's nothing else out on the market like this...the closest you'll get is a smart power strip (which obviously has it's own advantages/disadvantages compared to it all being built into a receptacle in the wall.)The price point is a little high for what is described above. I picked this up on sale for about 20% off and I'd say it's worth that....but with overall cost compared to what you get compared to getting a smart plug or a smart power strip, you'd likely be better off going that route. Unless like me, you wanted a specific use-case where not having a large brick hanging out of the wall would be more preferable then this thing is awesome. It looks incredibly clean, it's super responsive, and unfortunately it's also super loud (Which I guess is a good way to make sure it's working?)4/5 for what it is....5/5 if they include those three updates I'm looking for. Great product.###almost<12:18>|concept<49:56>|clear<61:67>|space<79:84>|area<89:94>|bulky<118:123>|smart<124:129>|smart plug<124:134>|plug<130:134>|connect<135:144>|personally<152:162>|kitchen<179:186>|end<196:199>|counter<207:214>|bottom<220:226>|plug<227:231>|always<243:249>|coffee<253:259>|machine<260:267>|top<276:279>|plug<280:284>|smart<290:295>|outlet<296:302>|christmas<323:332>|run<348:351>|christmas<352:361>|lights<362:368>|top<375:378>|cabinet<386:393>|perfectly<400:409>|locate<410:417>|allow<421:426>|run<433:436>|flat<439:443>|plug<444:448>|plug<444:451>|extension<452:461>|top<478:481>|cabinet<489:496>|cabinet<489:497>|wall<510:514>|open<523:527>|gap<528:531>|cabinet<541:548>|outlet<553:559>|easy<576:580>|install<584:591>|typical<601:608>|receptacle<609:619>|love<626:630>|style<660:665>|side<680:685>|receptacle<693:703>|hook<729:733>|loop<734:738>|cable<754:760>|standard<771:779>|size<780:784>|gfci<789:793>|receptacle<794:804>|fit<811:815>|box<835:838>|speed<853:858>|homekit<877:884>|turn<888:892>|instant<915:922>|button<932:938>|middle<946:952>|the middle<942:952>|manual<957:963>|manual control<957:971>|control<964:971>|top<979:982>|easy<994:998>|wish<1036:1040>|change<1049:1055>|receptacle<1067:1077>|plug<1097:1102>|control<1110:1117>|control<1110:1120>|top<1135:1138>|relay<1161:1166>|loud<1186:1190>|turn<1199:1203>|turn<1199:1204>|almost<1215:1221>|loud<1232:1236>|honestly<1244:1252>|surprise<1253:1262>|leviton<1263:1270>|thread<1293:1299>|connectivity<1300:1312>|build<1345:1350>|receptacle<1362:1372>|receptacle<1362:1373>|help<1377:1381>|connection<1397:1407>|multiple<1412:1420>|receptacle<1421:1431>|receptacle<1421:1432>|device<1443:1450>|thread<1461:1467>|protocol<1468:1476>|change<1492:1498>|change<1492:1499>|throw<1531:1536>|money<1537:1542>|market<1619:1625>|the market<1615:1625>|close<1642:1649>|smart<1666:1671>|power<1672:1677>|power strip<1672:1683>|strip<1678:1683>|obviously<1691:1700>|own<1710:1713>|compare<1739:1747>|build<1764:1769>|receptacle<1777:1787>|wall<1795:1799>|price<1805:1810>|price point<1805:1816>|point<1811:1816>|high<1829:1833>|describe<1846:1855>|pick<1865:1871>|sale<1883:1887>|worth<1923:1928>|overall<1946:1953>|cost<1954:1958>|compare<1959:1967>|compare<1984:1992>|smart<2006:2011>|plug<2012:2016>|smart plug<2006:2016>|smart<2022:2027>|power<2028:2033>|power strip<2028:2039>|strip<2034:2039>|likely<2047:2053>|specific<2115:2123>|use case<2124:2132>|case<2128:2132>|large<2152:2157>|wall<2183:2187>|incredibly<2250:2260>|clean<2261:2266>|super<2273:2278>|responsive<2279:2289>|unfortunately<2295:2308>|super<2319:2324>|loud<2325:2329>|guess<2339:2344>|include<2420:2427>|update<2440:2447>",

      "Squeaky click on some switches###squeaky<0:7>|click<8:13>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2019-03-08] <b>Great switch, needs more smart actions</b> I installed 25 tp-link switches (combination of dimmer, switch, and 3 way switch) in my home, and one wemo dimmer.Installation: The tp-link dimmers and switches have different attachment hardware (where you screw the switch to attach it to the electric box in the wall). This is annoying because the switches have a thick plastic, while the dimmers are metal but have a piece of plastic that screws onto the top of the front which has to be removed. I personally prefer the dimmer metal hardware. When you install a dimmer next to a switch you have to really fiddle with them to make the two different sizes look the same after the cover is on.What I like:I really like the fact that I can control these from the switch, my phone, or the from google assistant.I also have a in wall wemo dimmer. When I tell google to turn off or on the lights the wemo is significantly slower to respond then the tp-link. For tp-link the lights start to turn on//off in probably .5 sec while the wemo dimmer may take 2-8 seconds to start to respond.Look - the switches and the covers have a bright shiny finish. In most cases I was not able to use the included cover as they are installed in double or triple switch settings, but I like them where I was able to use them.Light compatibility - I've installed these with multiple kinds of dimmable LED lights and they have all functioned well.Light range - I replaced my living room light which originally had the wemo dimmer switch  and I noticed that the tp-link uses a greater range of the light bulb - i.e. it dims more and 100% brightness is brigher which I like.These also pretty quickly reconnect to wifi after I flip the breaker off or power outage (unlike some of my other smart devices that I have to setup over an over again with every power blip)Enhancements I would really like:Enabling third party triggers. I use IFTTT to integrate multiple smart things together. While these dimmers are compatible with IFTTT - they are only able to be used as THAT devices (in the \"if this than that\"(ifttt) recipes). So for example, with my wemo switch, if I wanted to turn on/off some other smart device when I clicked the wemo dimmer switch, I could use the wemo click as a THIS action or trigger. But these switches I can only use to respond to other actions, for example, when my door sensor senses that the door opened I can turn on the entry way light.True Instant on/off: The dimmer switches have a setting where you can change how fast they dim on and off when you click the switch. One option is \"Instant\". When I have it set to instant, it really just dims on/off fast. I have a non dimmer switch right next to a dimmer switch and when I click both at the same time the dimmer light takes longer, probably a second to turn on, while the non-dimmable switch is instant. This would also probably help with non-dimmable lights. I had non-dimmable lights attached to some of my dimmers and these acted very poorly even when set to instant on. They really buzzed and some even continued to buzz loudly while on.Always on circle  light in switch - In places where I have three dimmers together, when I turn one light on, that switches circle on the switch turns off. When I go to turn the light off I instantly think that the switches with the light on are the ones that are on, so I click those two only to find that neither of those lights were on and end up cycling through all three switches.In the kasa app when you select a dimmer or a switch the UI is completely different, it would be nice for them to be more similar.What I don't like -The click. About 1 out of every 4 times that I click the switch it doesn't turn on/off. Probably similar to learning to double click on a computer mouse for the first time (for those that can remember that). This could also probably be resolved with the instant on/off I mentioned before. Because it takes about a second even on instant on for the light to come to full power, when you click on and didn't click hard enough you end up walking past the switch thinking it is just takings its second to dim on, but then you have to walk back to the switch once it actually doesn't work. Some of my switches also have a bit of a squeaky click, which is also annoying.Note about 3-way switches - Even though my house was built fairly recently, for every set of three way switches, only one of the two wall wirings has the white wire. Luckily these can be paired with an old dumb three way switch and work quite well (i.e. you can use a single 2 pack of 3-way switches for two separate sets of 3-way sockets)Note about wifi - I have mesh wifi in a smallish house so my wifi coverage is good throughout and wifi connectivity has not been an issue for switches.Update Feb 2020:Smart actions - Auto off action. I really like this feature. I have my bathroom vent fans set to auto off after 15 minutes, and I think it has always worked except for one time my WiFi was down. The problem, your only allowed 3 smart actions. I’d love to be able to set more. My son uses the bathroom at the far end of my house and leaves the light on every time. A 15 minute auto off would be perfect. It would also work for closet and hallway lights. TP-link please add more smart actions.###smart<28:33>|action<34:40>|action<34:41>|smart action<28:41>|install<48:55>|all<52:55>|instal<48:57>|tp<61:63>|link<64:68>|tp link<61:68>|tp link

      "Faint high pitch whine when lights are off or dimmed###faint<0:5>|high<6:10>|dim<46:52>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2021-01-03] <b>Great value, works well, but there are a couple of things to consider</b> This switch was my first step toward building a smart home, and the installation was straightforward and went as well as could be expected for an amateur like myself.  It works great with the Kasa App and plays nice with Google Home, IFTTT and Home Assistant.  I've worked it into a couple of automations and it's been responsive and worked as expected every step of the way.  It also has a good looking, minimal design.There are just 2 things keeping me from giving it a full 5 stars:  1. As others have said, it's quite large.  It took some doing to get it to fit into my switch box with all the wires that were already in there.  Doable, but it did try my patience a little bit.  2.  When the lights are off or dimmed, there's a VERY faint high pitch whine that comes from the switch.  I can't hear it unless I'm right up on the switch, but now that I've noticed it, I can't pretend it's not there.  It's super quiet, but definitely not silent.All said, it's a great bang for the buck and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.  I do wish TP-Link would release a 3-way version of this dimmer.  I'd rather keep the look consistent than buy another brand.###great value<3:14>|value<9:14>|a couple<42:50>|couple<44:50>|consider<64:72>|first<96:101>|step<102:106>|build<114:122>|smart<125:130>|smart home<125:135>|home<131:135>|a smart home<123:135>|installation<145:157>|straightforward<162:177>|kasa<269:273>|the kasa app<265:277>|kasa app<269:277>|play<282:287>|google<298:304>|google home<298:309>|home<305:309>|ifttt<311:316>|home<321:325>|assistant<326:335>|home assistant<321:335>|a couple<358:366>|couple<360:366>|automation<370:381>|responsive<396:406>|step<436:440>|looking<473:480>|minimal<482:489>|design<490:496>|keep<521:525>|keep<521:528>|give<537:543>|full<549:553>|5 star<554:561>|large<599:604>|fit<639:642>|box<658:661>|wire<675:680>|already<691:698>|dim<791:797>|faint<814:819>|high<820:824>|hear<874:878>|now<921:924>|notice<935:942>|super<985:990>|definitely<1002:1012>|buck<1060:1064>|again<1099:1104>|wish<1112:1116>|tp<1117:1119>|link<1120:1124>|tp link<1117:1124>|release<1131:1138>|3 way<1141:1146>|version<1147:1154>|dimmer<1163:1169>|keep<1183:1187>|consistent<1197:1207>|brand<1225:1230>|another brand<1217:1230>"

      "Brightness level LEDs on top###brightness<0:10>|level<11:16>|brightness level<0:16>|led<17:21>|top<25:28>|||B079775ZZQ ★★☆☆☆ [2023-01-14] <b>Not the best design and no web interface. Requires app for install and updates.</b> These are smart / WiFi dimmers that are hard-wired into a junction box for switched lights.Only supports 2.4 Ghz WifI band -- some of the hardware variants used in individual dimmers will stay connected indefinitely and some will disconnect and reconnect randomly and as frequently every few minutes.  It apparently has to do with the WiFi chips, firmware, or both.Sometimes the brightness level LEDs on the top if the dimmer will get stuck and stay on and at other times, they turn off after a few seconds.Alexa integration is OK for basic functions, but gets complicated rapidly as the number of named devices increases. You will need to come up with creative names if, for example, you have more than one dimmer per named room and then you will have to remember which are which. There is no alexa integration for calibration. firmware updates, or time or time zone adjustments.These dimmers work for most light sources:  incandescent (but wattage is limited to 200) and some dimmable fluorescent and some LED bulbs.Requires an app for initial installation, dimmer calibration, and for firmware or time updates.There is no easy reference source on the product page for bulb compatibility, so be sure you test your bulbs before going to the trouble to install these dimmers.Worked poorly on Feit LED candelabra bulbs: there was noticeable bulb flickering at dimming levels below 60 percent.Single pole (one switch) only.  Requires a neutral and ground connection, so there will be four wire connections per dimmer (green, white, and two for the controlled device).  Oddly, the green and white connections require wire nuts but the line and load are screwed into the side of the dimmer.Large back cover uses a lot of space in the junction box, so not the best choice for small or crowded junction boxes.The front up and down controls are too small and should be bigger.The indicator LED bulb is very dim and cannot be seen in a bright room.  A dimmable indicator on a dimmer would have been be a logical design choice, but it's not available on this model.There still is no web interface for these smart dimmers -- only app controls.  The Apple app does not support accessibility options and is not suitable for those with vision issues -- moreover, the contrast and size on the app screens is very poor even for those with good vision -- especially if your Apple device uses adaptive backlighting.There is a removable, screwless faceplate which is a nice feature. The face plate and switch front are a high gloss finish that shows fingerprints and scratches; a matte finish would be much better.There are two very small, unmarked and hard-to-access switches built into the dimmer bottom.  One reboots the dimmer without removing the programming and account information. The other wipes the device and removes it from an account.For those who prefer a flawless installation, be sure that the dimmer is not angled when you screw it into the junction box.  If there is any angle, the face plate will not fit flush with the dimmer. This is especially important if there are more than one switch or dimmer in a junction box.###design<16:22>|web<30:33>|interface<34:43>|face<39:43>|require<45:53>|install<62:69>|update<74:81>|smart<97:102>|wifi<105:109>|dim<110:113>|dimmer<110:116>|dimmer<110:117>|hard<127:131>|wire<132:136>|wire<132:137>|junction<145:153>|box<154:157>|junction

LED indicators failing.</b> The attached leads makes it much easier (compared to 1st gen) to install and manage wires inside electrical boxes. There appears to be some defect with the LED indicator lights on these 2nd gen dimmers. I bought 4 from Amazon and 2 from Home Depot and so far 3 have had the LED indicators failed (both brightness level indicators on the side as well as on/off indicator at the bottom). 1 dimmer never had the LED indicators work and 2 dimmers had their LED indicators fail after about 1 or 2 days after install. The dimming function still works, just no indicator LED. I have more than 40 of these devices around the house and never had a problem with LED indicator lights with 1st gen dimmers (3+ years of use).###lead<12:17>|easy<24:30>|wiring<31:37>|lead<39:42>|led<39:42>|indicator<43:52>|indicator<43:53>|led indicator<39:53>|fail<54:58>|fail<54:61>|lead<80:85>|easy<100:106>|compare<108:116>|1st<120:123>|1st gen<120:127>|gen<124:127>|install<132:139>|manage<144:150>|wire<151:156>|side<159:163>|electrical<164:174>|electrical box<164:180>|box<175:180>|appear<188:195>|defect<207:213>|led<223:226>|lead<223:226>|indicator<227:236>|indicator light<227:243>|2nd<253:256>|gen<257:260>|2nd gen<253:260>|dimmer<261:267>|dimmer<261:268>|home<304:308>|depot<309:314>|home depot<304:314>|far<322:325>|led<341:344>|lead<341:344>|indicator<345:354>|led indicator<341:355>|indicator<345:355>|fail<356:360>|fail<356:362>|brightness<369:379>|level<380:385>|brightness level<369:385>|indicator<386:395>|indicator<386:396>|side<404:408>|indicator<427:436>|bottom<444:450>|dimmer<455:461>|never<462:467>|led<476:479>|lead<476:479>|indicator<480:489>|indicator<480:490>|led indicator<476:490>|dimmer<502:508>|dimmer<502:509>|led<520:523>|lead<520:523>|indicator<524:533>|led indicator<520:534>|indicator<524:534>|fail<535:539>|day<559:563>|install<570:577>|dim<583:590>|function<591:599>|still<600:605>|indicator<621:630>|lead<631:634>|led<631:634>|device<665:672>|house<684:689>|never<694:699>|problem<706:713>|lead<719:722>|led<719:722>|indicator<723:732>|indicator light<723:739>|1st<745:748>|1st gen<745:752>|gen<749:752>|dimmer<753:759>|dimmer<753:760>|3 year<762:770>|year<765:770>|year of use<765:777>"

You can manipulate the length of the fade, but you can't completely eliminate it.Maybe the ability to choose the color of the standby light would be nice too. Sometimes I wake up at night and that white circle shines like a beacon in my otherwise completely dark room.The UI in the app could use a little work too. Made a bit more compact and add more functionality to the home screen in regards to what I can do without having to go into the individual device's menu screen. Add dark mode.Otherwise, I'm very happy with these switches. One of my favorite functions is double pressing the switch and watch the light very slowly fade out.

The share of their buttons is not that user friendly or aesthetic. It looks too bland. My old parents are not phone friendly so they end of using the switch physically and it’s not apparent to them if it turned on or off ;) Being an engineers/entrepreneur with multiple startups (successful exits and top notch products 😎), I can tell you that this can be done.

It's not my internet connection but the switch itself can enter a state where its display indicates it's off but it's actually sending full current. The Kasa app and other downstream apps like Google Assistant also think it's off. You tell Google to turn it off, it says it's off, but it's STILL ON.It happens the other way too. Sometimes you turn \"on\" a switch, the switch indicates that it's on, but the lights aren't on.I have about 30 of these switches in my vacation house and they're all not entirely reliable some of the time. If you press them a few times eventually they realize how to be normal and they're fine. But it's annoying.In our primary house we have Lutron Caseta and they are incredibly reliable. I know they're twice the price, and it's debatable whether a \"smart home\" is super helpful anyway....... but I kinda wish we just did Caseta's at both properties even though they're super expensive.###entirely<7:15>|reliable<16:24>|internet<86:94>|enable<95:102>|all<154:157>|actually<150:158>|annoying<164:172>|internet<186:194>|connection<195:205>|internet connection<186:205>|enter<232:237>|state<240:245>|display<256:263>|indicate<264:273>|all<296:299>|actually<292:300>|send<301:308>|full<309:313>|current<314:321>|kasa<327:331>|the kasa app<323:335>|kasa app<327:335>|google<367:373>|assistant<374:383>|google assistant<367:383>|google<414:420>|turn<424:428>|still<464:469>|happen<476:483>|sometimes<503:512>|turn<517:521>|indicate<548:557>|vacation<637:645>|house<646:651>|all<664:667>|entirely<672:680>|reliable<681:689>|press<715:720>|all<744:747>|eventually<738:748>|realize<754:761>|normal<772:778>|annoying<806:814>|primary<822:829>|house<830:835>|lutron<844:850>|lutron caseta<844:857>|caseta<851:857>|incredibly<871:881>|reliable<882:890>|twice<907:912>|price<917:922>|smart<954:959>|home<960:964>|a smart home<951:964>|smart home<954:964>|super<969:974>|helpful<975:982>|kinda<1003:1008>|wish<1009:1013>|caseta<1026:1032>|property<1043:1053>|super<1074:1079>|expensive<1080:1089>",

I love the schedule feature, and the dimmable feature. I use this to turn flood lights on in the night at 50% brightness to deter unwanted trespassers.Some people complained that there is a light on the HS220 switch that glows when the switch is off. This is true, but it’s not a very bright glow at all, just barely as bright as the newest Apple Watch when you put it into “always on” mode. The good news is that you are able to turn off the little light from the Kasa app.As far as the humming sounds people claim about the switch or bulbs, I’ve not noticed any buzzing from the switch or bulbs I’m using. I’m using four ecosmart LED bulbs (65 watt replacement, dimmable, model BR30 flood lights from Home Depot)Scheduling times to turn the switch on and off used to be finicky and not work at all, but I was informed by support via email that the HS220 should be factory reset by pressing the hidden reset button for 10 seconds. I then setup the switch to wifi and this fixed the scheduling issue.Support via email was good. Took a little long to solve the issue with the scheduling but the issue was solved regardless.

      "Status LED###status<0:6>|lead<7:10>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2022-08-10] <b>Found Delay Compared to Standard Kasa Light Switches</b> First of all, let me say how much I like the Kasa light switches over the Wemo brand.  I had Wemo for a number of years, but lately, they have been very flaky when it came to automatic turning on and off; apparently there were issues with connectivity to their corporate servers.  That has not been the case with the new Kasa switches.  I'm almost in love with the Kasa switches, but not quite.With the Dimmer switch, I am noticing a second or two delay from when the switch is turned on and when the light bulb actually turns on.  This is not a function of the light bulb, as the same bulb turned on instantly when using regular (non-dimmer) switches from Kasa (HS103 and HS200).  I have not found a solution for this issue.  Due to this issue, I knocked off a star from my review.I also found a slight issue with the installation compared to the HS200 Smart Switch.  Unlike the HS200 Smart Switch, the HS220 Smart Dimmer Switch does require the need to identify the \"source\" and \"load\" sides of the switched line (both will be black inside the wall).  The first time I installed one of these HS220 switches, I did not realize that, and the switch would not operate; when I reversed the connections, everything worked as expected.  I did not have to worry about \"source\" vs \"load\" with the HS200; I am not sure why Kasa would not have the same circuitry in both to make it simpler to install the HS220.Also, I am not a fan of the \"status LED\" being off when the lights are on, and on when the lights are off.  In the bedroom, I need total darkness; the \"status LED\" is bright enough to keep me awake.  I have subsequently turned off the \"status LED\", so it is no longer illuminating at any time.  However, this is problematic for \"hidden\" lights, such as outdoor or closet lights.  For these, I would love to see the ability to set the \"status LED\" to on when the light is on, as it would be nice to see the \"status LED\" indicate the actual status of those lights, without having to apply reverse logic (i.e., on is off, off is on).  In this, Wemo got it right (LED on when light is on, LED off when light is off).  Kasa got it partially right in having the ability to disable the LED.Overall, these are very good switches, and I would highly recommend them over the Wemo brand at this point in time.  I now have a mix of HS103 (Smart Plugs), HS200 (Smart Switches - Single Pole), and now HS220 (Smart Dimmer Switches - Single Pole).  They are very reliable!  The Kasa app works very well.  I also like how the switches can be controlled using Google Home (I do not use Alexa or Siri), as my Android phone has Google Home installed on it.  Simply put, \"it just works\".  That is the reason I bought these switches.###find<3:8>|delay<9:14>|compare<15:23>|standard<27:35>|kasa<36:40>|switches<47:55>|first<60:65>|let<74:77>|kasa<105:109>|wemo<134:138>|brand<139:144>|wemo<153:157>|number<164:170>|year<174:179>|automatic<235:244>|turn<245:252>|apparently<265:275>|issue<287:292>|issue<287:293>|connectivity<299:311>|issue with connectivity<287:311>|server<331:338>|case<363:367>|new<377:380>|kasa<381:385>|almost<401:407>|love<411:415>|kasa<425:429>|dimmer<463:469>|notice<483:491>|second<494:500>|delay<508:513>|turn<538:544>|bulb<567:571>|actual<572:578>|actually<572:580>|turn<581:586>|function<606:614>|bulb<628:632>|same<641:645>|bulb<646:650>|turn<651:657>|instantly<661:670>|regular<682:689>|non<691:694>|dimmer<695:701>|kasa<717:721>|find<753:758>|solution<761:769>|issue<779:784>|issue<799:804>|knock<808:815>|find<849:854>|slight<857:863>|issue<864:869>|install<879:886>|installation<879:891>|compare<892:900>|smart<914:919>|smart<946:951>|smart<970:975>|dimmer<976:982>|smart dimmer<970:982>|smart dimmer switch<970:989>|require<995:1002>|identify<1015:1023>|source<1029:1035>|load<1042:1046>|side<1048:1053>|load side<1042:1053>|line<1070:1074>|black<1089:1094>|wall<1106:1110>|first<1118:1123>|the first time<1114:1128>|first time<1118:1128>|install<1131:1138>|instal<1131:1140>|realize<1180:1187>|operate<1219:1226>|connection<1248:1259>|worry<1311:1316>|source<1324:1330>|load<1336:1340>|kasa<1376:1380>|same<1400:1404>|simple<1434:1441>|install<1445:1452>|fan<1480:1483>|status<1492:1498>|lead<1499:1502>|bedroom<1578:1585>|total<1594:1599>|status<1615:1621>|lead<1622:1625>|bright<1630:1636>|keep<1647:1651>|turn<1683:1689>|status<1699:1705>|lead<1706:1709>|long<1724:1730>|however<1758:1765>|problematic<1775:1786>|outdoor<1816:1823>|set<1830:1833>|closet<1827:1833>|love<1862:1866>|ability<1878:1885>|set<1889:1892>|status<1898:1904>|lead<1905:1908>|status<1970:1976>|lead<1977:1980>|indicate<1982:1990>|actual<1995:2001>|status<2002:2008>|wemo<2104:2108>|lead<2123:2126>|lead<2148:2151>|kasa<2177:2181>|ability<2219:2226>|disable<2230:2237>|lead<2242:2245>|highly<2297:2303>|recommend<2304:2313>|wemo<2328:2332>|brand<2333:2338>|this point<2342:2352>|point<2347:2352>|now<2365:2368>|mix<2376:2379>|smart<2390:2395>|plugs<2396:2401>|smart<2411:2416>|smart switches<2411:2425>|switches<2417:2425>|single<2428:2434>|pole<2435:2439>|single pole<2428:2439>|now<2446:2449>|smart<2457:2462>|smart dimmer<2457:2469>|dimmer<2463:2469>|smart dimmer switch<2457:2476>|dimmer switches<2463:2478>|smart dimmer switches<2457:2478>|switches<2470:2478>|single<2481:2487>|pole<2488:2492>|single pole<2481:2492>|reliable<2510:2518>|kasa<2525:2529>|the kasa app<2521:2533>|kasa app<2525:2533>|control<2588:2598>|google<2605:2611>|home<2612:2616>|google home<2605:2616>|alexa<2631:2636>|siri<2640:2644>|android<2653:2660>|phone<2661:2666>|google<2671:2677>|home<2678:2682>|google home<2671:2682>|install<2683:2690>|instal<2683:2692>|simply<2701:2707>|put<2708:2711>|reason<2743:2749>",

      "Glowing light on the switch when lights are out###glow<0:7>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2022-11-04] <b>Nice smart switch for the price</b> I just started re-adding new smart items to my home and began with KASA because of the reviews.  I had 2 of their color smart bulbs already and I enjoyed using my phone or Google Assistant and a timer schedule to turn them on off, dim, and change colors.  But then, I wanted more... so I bought a few of these smart dimmer switches. (smart outlets, motions sensors, and cameras are next)These dimmer switches don't seem to mix well with the smart bulbs in my opinion, because they both register in the app separately with their own controls - so if the smart dimmer switch is off, you can't turn the bulb on through the app without turning the switch on first.  Or... if you dim the smart bulb through the app then the smart dimmer switch gets out of sync.  It's kind of weird.  I'm sure there's a way to make it happy, but with Google Home, I had to have both items separate if I wanted to use the dimmer switch and change the bulb's color.Anyway, I used regular dimmable LED bulbs with the KASA smart dimmer switches and they work awesome with the app or voice.  And I like the little glowing light on the switch when the lights are out.  Plus the time schedule feature and the ability to slowly dim and brighten the lights when you turn them on and off... really cool.  And you can double-tap or hold the switch to fade out/fade in.I know smart stuff like this isn't anything new and exciting, I had all X10 smart outlets and switches with remote controls back in the 2000's, but that company was sketchy and disappeared after I spent several hundred dollars on smart things...  It took me a long time to decide to start over again.  I sure hope this company doesn't disappear after I spend a lot of money getting everything in my house automated with their products.  :P###smart<8:13>|price<29:34>|start<46:51>|start<46:53>|add<57:63>|new<64:67>|smart<68:73>|home<86:90>|begin<95:100>|kasa<106:110>|color<153:158>|smart<159:164>|bulb<165:169>|bulb<165:170>|already<171:178>|enjoy<185:192>|phone<202:207>|google<211:217>|google assistant<211:227>|assistant<218:227>|timer<234:239>|schedule<240:248>|turn<252:256>|dim<270:273>|change<279:285>|color<286:291>|color<286:292>|smart<349:354>|dim<355:358>|dimmer<355:361>|smart dimmer<349:361>|these smart dimmer<343:361>|smart dimmer switch<349:368>|smart dimmer switch<349:370>|smart<373:378>|outlet<379:386>|motion<388:395>|motion sensor<388:403>|sensor<396:403>|camera<409:416>|dim<432:435>|dimmer<432:438>|mix<462:465>|smart<480:485>|bulb<486:490>|bulb<486:491>|opinion<498:505>|register<525:533>|separate<545:553>|separately<545:555>|own<567:570>|control<571:579>|smart<592:597>|dim<598:601>|dimmer<598:604>|smart dimmer<592:604>|smart dimmer switch<592:611>|turn<630:634>|bulb<639:643>|turn<671:675>|turn<671:678>|first<693:698>|dim<714:717>|smart<722:727>|bulb<728:732>|smart<758:763>|dim<764:767>|dimmer<764:770>|smart dimmer<758:770>|smart dimmer switch<758:777>|sync<790:794>|kind<802:806>|weird<810:815>|happy<852:857>|google<868:874>|google home<868:879>|home<875:879>|separate<906:914>|dim<938:941>|dimmer<938:944>|change<956:962>|bulb<967:971>|color<974:979>|anyway<980:986>|regular<995:1002>|dim<1003:1006>|dimmable<1003:1011>|led<1012:1015>|dimmable led<1003:1015>|bulb<1016:1020>|bulb<1016:1021>|led bulb<1012:1021>|dimmable led bulb<1003:1021>|kasa<1031:1035>|smart<1036:1041>|dim<1042:1045>|dimmer<1042:1048>|smart dimmer<1036:1048>|kasa smart dimmer<1031:1048>|smart dimmer switch<1036:1055>|smart dimmer switch<1036:1057>|voice<1096:1101>|schedule<1194:1202>|feature<1203:1210>|ability<1219:1226>|slowly<1230:1236>|dim<1237:1240>|brighten<1245:1253>|turn<1274:1278>|cool<1305:1309>|double<1324:1330>|tap<1331:1334>|double tap<1324:1334>|hold<1338:1342>|fade<1357:1361>|fade<1366:1370>|smart<1381:1386>|new<1418:1421>|smart<1450:1455>|outlet<1456:1463>|remote<1482:1488>|remote control<1482:1497>|control<1489:1497>|back<1498:1502>|company<1527:1534>|spend<1571:1576>|dollar<1593:1600>|smart<1604:1609>|long<1634:1638>|a long time<1632:1643>|decide<1647:1653>|start<1657:1662>|again<1668:1673>|hope<1683:1687>|company<1693:1700>|spend<1727:1732>|money<1742:1747>|house<1773:1778>|automate<1779:1788>",

I have small 2 kids and they constantly leave the lights on in our entire downstairs family room area. I often wouldn't know that they left a light on for hours or, for the garage, the whole night sometimes.So I had to find something that would stop the headache. T bought this switch specifically for our family room/playroomMy goals when I started shopping:* Find a switch that has a plate with zero screws if I could- I liked the look for areas that mattered. this is a single switch and comes with a plate with no screws. I couldn't use it for where I was installing this but will save the plate for something else* Reliable light that would work well with wifi and my Amazon Alexa* \"Quick\" response when you give the order to Alexa- some lights had a bit of a delay from your request to when it actually turned on* a brand that could offer multiple models so I wouldn't have to download multiple apps to get them to work* a switch that did not have a super bright light that stayed on all the time- like the little green light. This one has a faint circle when the light is off that is perfect.These covered it all. I am pretty handy with electrical and I was able to install these myself in about 10-15 mins. The app has an amazing walk through to make it even easier.From there it was basically 2 clicks to have it sync with my Alexa and I was well on my way. I couldn't be happier.Couple of things to note:1) make sure you have a strong wifi signal in the area where you are wanting to set these up- I put 2 of them in my garage and it took a bit longer for them to sync as the wifi isn't super strong as soon as i walk through my garage doors2) This brand does not come as a double with a double plate- so as you will notice in the picture in the case of the double switch I used one that had exposed screws.3) The dimmer function is great- it has you test how low your lights will go during setup and then that sets the \"range\" that it dims. You can also use the app to further customize the range.Love these and plan on buying many more of this brand.###first<19:24>|first time<19:29>|smart<30:35>|install<43:50>|absolutely<60:70>|love<71:75>|small<99:104>|kid<107:111>|constantly<121:131>|leave<132:137>|entire<159:165>|family<177:183>|family room<177:188>|room<184:188>|area<189:193>|often<197:202>|leave<227:231>|hour<247:252>|garage<265:271>|whole<277:282>|night<283:288>|sometimes<289:298>|find<311:315>|stop<337:341>|headache<346:354>|specifically<377:389>|family<398:404>|family room<398:409>|room<405:409>|room<414:418>|start<434:441>|shop<442:450>|find<453:457>|plate<478:483>|screw<494:500>|area<534:538>|area<534:539>|matter<545:553>|single<565:571>|plate<596:601>|screw<610:616>|install<652:659>|instal<652:662>|save<677:681>|plate<686:691>|reliable<712:720>|able<716:720>|wifi<753:757>|amazon alexa<765:777>|alexa<772:777>|quick<780:785>|quick response<780:795>|response<787:795>|give<805:809>|alexa<823:828>|delay<857:862>|request<873:880>|actually<892:900>|turn<901:907>|brand<914:919>|offer<931:936>|multiple<937:945>|model<946:952>|download<975:983>|multiple<984:992>|super<1048:1053>|bright<1054:1060>|stay<1072:1078>|green<1112:1117>|one<1130:1133>|faint<1140:1145>|circle<1146:1152>|cover<1197:1204>|pretty<1218:1224>|handy<1225:1230>|electrical<1236:1246>|able<1257:1261>|install<1265:1272>|min<1301:1305>|walk<1330:1334>|easy<1359:1365>|basically<1384:1393>|click<1396:1402>|sync<1414:1418>|alexa<1427:1432>|happy<1473:1480>|couple<1481:1487>|strong<1530:1536>|wifi<1537:1541>|signal<1542:1548>|wifi signal<1537:1548>|area<1556:1560>|set<1586:1589>|put<1602:1605>|garage<1622:1628>|long<1647:1653>|sync<1666:1670>|wifi<1678:1682>|super<1689:1694>|strong<1695:1701>|soon<1705:1709>|walk<1715:1719>|garage<1731:1737>|brand<1751:1756>|double<1776:1782>|double<1790:1796>|plate<1797:1802>|notice<1819:1825>|picture<1833:1840>|case<1848:1852>|double<1860:1866>|one<1881:1884>|screw<1902:1908>|dimmer<1916:1922>|function<1923:1931>|the dimmer function<1912:1931>|test<1953:1957>|low<1962:1965>|set<1993:1996>|setup<1993:1998>|set<2013:2016>|set<2013:2017>|range<2023:2028>|dim<2038:2042>|far<2072:2079>|customize<2080:2089>|range<2094:2099>|love<2100:2104>|plan<2115:2119>|brand<2148:2153>",
      "White circle of light on switch when off###white<0:5>|white circle<0:12>|circle<6:12>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2019-06-20] <b>Great Dimmer Switch</b> I have an overhead dining room light that had been driving me nuts for years. It has always been too bright and harsh, and we only had the standard light switch. I had been thinking about putting a dimmer switch on for years, but never got around to it until now.I chose the TP-Link version because I already have several Kasa Smart Plugs in my household, along with an Amazon Echo that I use to control them. I figured it would be easier to have fewer smart home ecosystems to have to deal with.The installation was easy, but you have to be comfortable with basic wiring and dealing with electricity. You also need to be sure that you have a neutral wire available -- mine was tucked back behind the other wires. Additionally, you should have a voltage sensor handy, as you will need to use it to determine which wire has the electricity running through it when the switch is off. You can purchase a cheap one, but this is a requirement. Once you have done that, you just boot up the Kasa app, and it runs you through everything. Total installation time was about 20 minutes or so.Once you have the switch installed, the app runs you through the set up, and my light was working in no time. It was very easy, and I had no issues.The switch itself looks decent -- when it is off, a white circle of light appears on the switch, which makes it easy to find in the dark, but might be annoying if you are installing this in your bedroom. There is also a brightness control panel above the switch.The only thing to be aware of with this switch is that if you are using LED lights, you want to make sure you have dimmable LEDs. Also, you should try to get some that don't buzz. I was using cheap store brand LEDs that were supposedly dimmable, but they would buzz like crazy at lower light levels and even flicker. I went out and bought some better ones, and it mostly solved the problem. There is no longer any flickering, but just a slight buzz at lower levels that I can definitely deal with.The integration with Alexa is fabulous, as you can turn the light on and off and choose a dimming value with your voice. The app also works well, but I generally use Alexa.Overall, I highly recommend this switch to anyone looking to upgrade their switches and add to their smart home ecosystem. Just be prepared to do some VERY basic wiring.###dimmer<9:15>|overhead<37:45>|dining<46:52>|room<53:57>|dining room<46:57>|dining room light<46:63>|drive<78:85>|nut<89:93>|year<98:103>|always<112:118>|bright<128:134>|standard<166:174>|standard light switch<166:187>|put<215:222>|dimmer<225:231>|year<246:251>|never<257:262>|now<286:289>|choose<292:297>|tp<302:304>|tp link<302:309>|link<305:309>|the tp link<298:309>|version<310:317>|already<328:335>|kasa<349:353>|smart<354:359>|kasa smart<349:359>|plugs<360:365>|household<372:381>|echo<404:408>|control<423:430>|figure<439:446>|easy<459:465>|smart<480:485>|home<486:490>|smart home<480:490>|ecosystem<491:500>|home ecosystem<486:500>|smart home ecosystem<480:500>|ecosystem<491:501>|smart home ecosystem<480:501>|home ecosystem<486:501>|deal<513:517>|installation<527:539>|easy<544:548>|comfortable<569:580>|basic<586:591>|wiring<592:598>|deal<603:607>|deal<603:610>|electricity<616:627>|neutral<670:677>|a neutral wire<668:682>|neutral wire<670:682>|wire<678:682>|available<683:692>|back<712:716>|wire<734:738>|wire<734:739>|additionally<741:753>|voltage<773:780>|sensor<781:787>|handy<788:793>|determine<825:834>|wire<841:845>|electricity<854:865>|run<866:873>|cheap<928:933>|one<934:937>|requirement<953:964>|one<981:984>|kasa<1012:1016>|the kasa app<1008:1020>|kasa app<1012:1020>|run<1029:1033>|total<1058:1063>|installation<1064:1076>|20 minute<1092:1102>|minute<1095:1102>|instal<1134:1143>|run<1153:1157>|set<1174:1177>|easy<1231:1235>|no issue<1247:1256>|issue<1250:1256>|decent<1281:1287>|white<1309:1314>|white circle<1309:1321>|circle<1315:1321>|appear<1331:1338>|easy<1369:1373>|find<1377:1381>|dark<1389:1393>|annoying<1408:1416>|instal<1428:1438>|room<1455:1459>|bedroom<1452:1459>|bright<1477:1483>|brightness<1477:1487>|control<1488:1495>|panel<1496:1501>|aware<1540:1545>|led<1591:1594>|led light<1591:1601>|dimmable<1634:1642>|led<1643:1646>|dimmable led<1634:1647>|led<1643:1647>|buzz<1693:1697>|cheap<1711:1716>|store<1717:1722>|brand<1723:1728>|led<1729:1732>|led<1729:1733>|dimmable<1755:1763>|buzz<1780:1784>|crazy<1790:1795>|low<1799:1804>|level<1811:1817>|flick<1827:1834>|one<1870:1873>|one<1870:1874>|mostly<1883:1889>|solve<1890:1896>|problem<1901:1908>|long<1922:1928>|flick<1933:1940>|flickering<1933:1943>|slight<1956:1962>|buzz<1963:1967>|low<1971:1976>|low level<1971:1983>|level<1977:1983>|definitely<1995:2005>|deal<2006:2010>|integration<2020:2031>|integration with alexa<2020:2042>|alexa<2037:2042>|turn<2067:2071>|choose<2097:2103>|dim<2106:2113>|value<2114:2119>|voice<2130:2135>|generally<2168:2177>|alexa<2182:2187>|overall<2188:2195>|highly<2199:2205>|recommend<2206:2215>|one<2234:2237>|upgrade<2249:2256>|add<2276:2279>|smart<2289:2294>|smart home<2289:2299>|home<2295:2299>|home ecosystem<2295:2309>|ecosystem<2300:2309>|smart home ecosystem<2289:2309>|basic<2344:2349>|wiring<2350:2356>",

Full dimming (1%) is still too bright.</b> I have several Kasa devices in the house.  Overall I have been happy with them, but THIS one came with NO Instructions.  As I have installed several Kasa devices, have a Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering, AND helped to build the Global Positioning System (1976-78), I was able to determine which wires went where (green to copper ground, white to neutral, black screw = 120v Hot, gold screw to the lighting load).  BUT if you are a NOOB - better forget about installing this switch.  In addition - as I had several other KASA devices, I knew that once powered up, the blinking orange and green LED meant I should connect to that device as my WiFi connection and link it to my Router's WiFi ID and Password.  I then named the device, and it automatically appeared as the named device in my Amazon (Alexa) account.This switch controls 4 x 100w equivalent ceiling LED cans.  Even at Full Dimming (1%), the lights are too bright.  I did download the most recent firmware - however no fix regarding the dimmable settings.Hey KASA - kindly extend the dimming range on this device (next firmware update) AND include wiring and WiFi connection settings In The Box.###install<7:14>|zero<17:21>|instruction<22:34>|box<42:45>|full<48:52>|dimming<53:60>|dim<53:60>|still<69:74>|bright<79:85>|kasa<106:110>|device<111:117>|device<111:118>|house<126:131>|overall<134:141>|happy<154:159>|one<180:183>|instruction<197:209>|instal<222:231>|kasa<240:244>|device<245:251>|device<245:252>|electrical<279:289>|engineering<290:301>|help<307:313>|build<317:322>|system<346:352>|able<370:374>|determine<378:387>|wire<394:399>|green<412:417>|copper<421:427>|ground<428:434>|white<436:441>|neutral<445:452>|black<454:459>|screw<460:465>|hot<473:476>|screw<483:488>|lighting<496:504>|load<505:509>|forget<544:550>|instal<557:567>|addition<585:593>|kasa<619:623>|device<624:630>|device<624:631>|once<645:649>|power<650:657>|link<667:671>|blink<666:674>|orange<675:681>|range<676:681>|green<686:691>|led<692:695>|mean<696:701>|connect<711:718>|device<727:733>|wifi<740:744>|connect<745:752>|connection<745:755>|wifi connection<740:755>|link<760:764>|router<774:780>|wifi<783:787>|password<795:803>|name<813:818>|device<823:829>|automatically<838:851>|appear<852:860>|name<868:873>|device<874:880>|amazon alexa<887:900>|alexa<895:900>|account<902:909>|control<922:930>|equivalent<940:950>|ceiling<951:958>|led<959:962>|full<978:982>|dimming<983:990>|bright<1016:1022>|load<1035:1039>|download<1031:1039>|most<1044:1048>|recent<1049:1055>|firmware<1056:1064>|recent firmware<1049:1064>|however<1067:1074>|fix<1078:1081>|regard<1082:1091>|able<1100:1104>|dimmable<1096:1104>|setting<1105:1113>|kasa<1118:1122>|dim<1143:1150>|dimming<1143:1150>|range<1151:1156>|device<1165:1171>|next<1173:1177>|firmware<1178:1186>|firmware update<1178:1193>|update<1187:1193>|include<1199:1206>|wiring<1207:1213>|wifi<1218:1222>|connect<1223:1230>|wifi connection<1218:1233>|connection<1223:1233>|setting<1234:1242>|box<1250:1253>",
      "Has an LED indicator###led<7:10>|indicator<11:20>|led indicator<7:20>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2022-05-20] <b>It works pretty good. Only thing bad is the blink when adjusted to full brightness</b> This worked as expected.  It was bought to be able to have more control on the lighting when away for security. If you're away on a trip, you can create a profile on the app and control the light turn on/off times, and brightness levelsWhat I like about it is that it is capable of being programmed via the app. The app has improved over the years. Note I've had the Kasa Smart brand for my  wall outlet plugs and have 0 issues with it. My porch light has a one as well which works good.What I don't like is the feel.. I'm so use for  up to on, and down to be off. This switch (and other Kasa switches) have a single down press. I just wish they could have made the whole thing as a push button so it doen't feel weird needing to push down when turning on the lights.What I really don't like is the blinking of the lights when you set it to full power by pressing the button. I'm guessing that blink it to say it is at full power.. but it is annoying.. Blink the switch led.. not the main light.Dimmer features are much more course than an analog switch, but it is good enough. Interesting thing about this switch for brightness is that you can set what you consider \"100%\" lighting so it never goes over that. I haven't tested this feature but I found it interesting they gave this feature.Installing the switch was not difficult, but be sure to read the instructions and review instructions on how light switches are to be installed. It can get confusing sometimes.Synching the switch to the network and to the phone was easy. Since it was a first time install, it was blinking, which indicates that it is ready to be synchronized/connected. I didn't look on this switch, but my other Kasa switch had a resynch button in case you need to resynch it, so look in your instructions if you need to do this.Synching just required that I turn on my app and go through the motion of adding  a new device.  It steps you through the process.  Within the app you can control the brightness, On/Off, turn off timer, and schedule/program the on/off times. One thing I really liked about the Kasa was the capability of scheduling it to turn on at sunset and turn off on sunrise as a setting. This means I don't need to look up when the sunrises or sets.I know this is suppose to be able to integrate with Alexa and Google, but I haven't test this feature.###pretty<12:18>|blink<47:52>|adjust<58:66>|full<70:74>|brightness<75:85>|full brightness<70:85>|able<136:140>|control<154:161>|lighting<169:177>|away<183:187>|security<192:200>|away<212:216>|trip<222:226>|create<236:242>|profile<245:252>|control<268:275>|turn<286:290>|brightness<309:319>|able<364:368>|capable<361:368>|program<378:385>|program<378:388>|improve<414:422>|year<432:437>|note<439:443>|kasa<457:461>|the kasa smart<453:467>|kasa smart<457:467>|smart<462:467>|brand<468:473>|wall<482:486>|outlet<487:493>|plugs<494:499>|issue<511:517>|porch<530:535>|porch light<530:541>|feel<602:606>|down<639:643>|kasa<678:682>|other kasa switch<672:689>|other kasa switch<672:691>|single<700:706>|down<707:711>|press<712:717>|wish<726:730>|whole<756:761>|push<773:777>|button<778:784>|feel<798:802>|weird<803:808>|push<820:824>|down<825:829>|turn<835:839>|turn<835:842>|blink<889:894>|blink<889:897>|set<921:924>|full<931:935>|power<936:941>|press<945:950>|press<945:953>|button<958:964>|guess<970:978>|blink<984:989>|full<1009:1013>|power<1014:1019>|annoying<1032:1040>|blink<1043:1048>|lead<1060:1063>|main<1074:1078>|dimmer<1085:1091>|feature<1092:1099>|feature<1092:1100>|course<1115:1121>|analog<1130:1136>|brightness<1208:1218>|set<1235:1238>|consider<1248:1256>|lighting<1264:1272>|never<1279:1284>|test<1311:1315>|test<1311:1317>|feature<1323:1330>|find<1337:1342>|give<1363:1367>|feature<1373:1380>|instal<1381:1391>|difficult<1411:1420>|read<1437:1441>|instruction<1446:1458>|instruction<1470:1482>|install<1515:1522>|instal<1515:1524>|lead<1521:1524>|confusing<1537:1546>|sometimes<1547:1556>|network<1584:1591>|phone<1603:1608>|easy<1613:1617>|first<1634:1639>|first time<1634:1644>|install<1645:1652>|blink<1661:1666>|blink<1661:1669>|indicate<1677:1686>|read<1698:1702>|ready<1698:1703>|connect<1723:1732>|kasa<1777:1781>|other kasa switch<1771:1788>|button<1803:1809>|case<1813:1817>|instruction<1858:1870>|require<1908:1916>|turn<1924:1928>|motion<1958:1964>|add<1968:1974>|new<1978:1981>|device<1982:1988>|step<1994:1999>|process<2016:2023>|control<2049:2056>|brightness<2061:2071>|turn<2081:2085>|timer<2090:2095>|schedule<2101:2109>|program<2110:2117>|kasa<2171:2175>|capability<2184:2194>|schedule<2198:2208>|turn<2215:2219>|sunset<2226:2232>|set<2229:2232>|turn<2237:2241>|sunrise<2249:2256>|set<2262:2265>|setting<2262:2269>|mean<2276:2281>|sunrise<2315:2322>|sunrise<2315:2323>|set<2327:2330>|set<2327:2331>|suppose<2347:2354>|able<2361:2365>|integrate<2369:2378>|alexa<2384:2389>|google<2394:2400>|test<2416:2420>|feature<2426:2433>",
      "Glowing ring when off###glow<0:7>|ring<8:12>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2020-07-12] <b>Work great, alexa likes them. Tight fit in box, read my notes / view pics</b> Around 2005 I installed IR dimmers... But they require a controller... Which is often miss placed. Then I solved the problem in 2013 when I got a Samsung S4 phone... It had an IR blaster and the only reason why I got that phone... By 2016 it was time for a new phone... But no more IR port... Urgh... Moving up into the new decade... Replaced all 3 switches with these Wi-Fi switches. They work great, I already had other kaasa devices so alexa was already paired. I just named each and alexa turns them on or off. In order to dimm you have to say 'Alexa dimm living room lights 50%'. If you just say 'Dimm' it goes down like 5%.If your house is old like 1980s or possibly 90s, your gang boxes may suck like mine. I had the ones with the wings 'old work' and the screw to turn the wings was in the way  for the switch to go in... So a 5 minute job turned to an hour (each) It also helps to get the deepest gang boxes, the lights are a bit deep. See the pictures ofy fun time installing these. (not the lights fault) but if the back was 2mm smaller, it would have worked.My only complaint is that my old switches, you could turn the lights on using the dimmer function, these you can't. They do have lights indicating the level that the dimmer is set to. But I usually dimm all the way down then increase it by 2 clicks and then turn the lights on, else I'll blind whoever I'm trying not to wake up.The dimmer light level goes away when set. A ring glows when the light is off I guess to make it easy to see in the dark.###alexa<15:20>|tight<33:38>|fit<39:42>|tight fit<33:42>|box<46:49>|read<51:55>|note<59:64>|pic<72:76>|instal<95:104>|dimm<108:112>|dimmer<108:114>|dimmer<108:115>|require<128:135>|controller<138:148>|often<161:166>|miss<167:171>|place<172:178>|solve<187:193>|problem<198:205>|samsung<227:234>|phone<238:243>|only reason<276:287>|the only reason<272:287>|reason<281:287>|phone<303:308>|new<338:341>|phone<342:347>|move<382:388>|new<401:404>|place<417:423>|replace<415:423>|wi<450:452>|fi<453:455>|wi fi<450:455>|wi fi switch<450:464>|read<487:491>|already<485:492>|device<509:516>|alexa<520:525>|read<532:536>|already<530:537>|pair<538:544>|name<553:558>|alexa<568:573>|turn<574:578>|turn<574:579>|dimm<608:612>|alexa<630:635>|dimm<636:640>|living<641:647>|room<648:652>|living room<641:652>|dimm<683:687>|down<697:701>|house<718:723>|old<727:730>|possibly<745:753>|gang<764:768>|box<769:772>|box<769:774>|gang box<764:774>|suck<779:783>|one<805:809>|old<826:829>|screw<844:849>|turn<853:857>|minute<918:924>|5 minute<916:924>|job<925:928>|turn<929:933>|turn<929:935>|hour<942:946>|an hour<939:946>|help<962:967>|deep<979:983>|deep<979:986>|gang<987:991>|box<992:995>|box<992:997>|gang box<987:997>|deep<1020:1024>|picture<1034:1042>|fun<1047:1050>|instal<1056:1066>|fault<1090:1095>|back<1108:1112>|small<1121:1128>|only complaint<1154:1168>|complaint<1159:1168>|old<1180:1183>|turn<1204:1208>|dimm<1233:1237>|dimmer<1233:1239>|fun<1240:1243>|the dimmer function<1229:1248>|function<1240:1248>|indicate<1287:1297>|level<1302:1307>|dimm<1317:1321>|dimmer<1317:1323>|set<1327:1330>|usually<1341:1348>|dimm<1349:1353>|down<1366:1370>|increase<1376:1384>|click<1393:1399>|turn<1409:1413>|blind<1439:1444>|wake<1471:1475>|dimm<1483:1487>|dimmer<1483:1489>|level<1496:1501>|away<1507:1511>|set<1517:1520>|ring<1524:1528>|glow<1529:1534>|guess<1559:1564>|easy<1576:1580>|dark<1595:1599>",
      "Has an indicator light on the switch###indicator<7:16>|indicator light<7:22>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2021-11-15] <b>Mostly Great</b> I currently have 5 of these dimmer switches installed and personally think they are a great dimmer option.  I use them with Feit recessed LEDs and the TP-Link Deco M9 router.Pros:- They are a notable brand for what that is worth- They are very affordable relative to other name brand switches or going Z-Wave or Zigbee- Easy to install- They work relatively well with Feit bulbs which I have found to be very finicky.  They still don’t work perfectly and the bulbs still do still flicker a little at specific dimmer levels; but still better than other dimmer switches I have tried.- After rebooting my router, I have no issues with reconnections- Great integration with Home Assistant and Samsung SmartThings and can be cycled without an internet connectionCons:- No three-way option yet and you can only group up to 3 sets of switches in the Kaza app to mimic this function.  The workaround for this is to use Samsung SmartThings app which has equal if not better response time than Kasa’s native app.  I use the HS200 and HS220 with SmartThings to mimic a three way dimmer configuration.  In reality the HS220 controls the lights and the HS200 is powered but not connected to any lights directly.  The downside to this configuration is only the dimmer switch works manually without internet.  Response time between the switches is about 1 to 2 seconds using SmartThings or the Kasa app- I have had to reset one of my 23 devices in the past 6 months; however, that was as simple as pressing the reset button which just power cycles it, all setting are still saved- The dimmers have had a weird behavior that has happened twice where you turn them off, the switch will register as off including the indicator light on the switch itself, but the lights will still be on.  You have to press the switch again to “turn the light on” and then off again.  Again this has happened two times over several hundred cycles.###mostly<3:9>|currently<22:31>|dimmer<48:54>|these dimmer switch<42:63>|instal<64:73>|personally<78:88>|dimmer<112:118>|option<119:125>|feit<144:148>|recess<149:157>|led<158:162>|tp<171:173>|link<174:178>|the tp link<167:178>|tp link<171:178>|deco<179:183>|router<187:193>|brand<220:225>|affordable<264:274>|name<293:297>|name brand<293:303>|brand<298:303>|z wave<322:328>|wave<324:328>|easy<340:344>|relatively<367:377>|feit<388:392>|bulb<393:398>|feit bulb<388:398>|find<412:417>|still<444:449>|perfectly<461:470>|bulb<479:484>|still<485:490>|still<494:499>|flicker<500:507>|specific<520:528>|dimmer<529:535>|level<536:542>|still<548:553>|dimmer<572:578>|reboot<609:618>|router<622:628>|issue<640:646>|no issue<637:646>|integration<673:684>|home<690:694>|assistant<695:704>|home assistant<690:704>|samsung<709:716>|samsung smartthings<709:728>|smartthings<717:728>|cycle<740:746>|internet<758:766>|three way<787:796>|option<797:803>|yet<804:807>|group<825:830>|set<839:843>|function<886:894>|workaround<901:911>|samsung<931:938>|samsung smartthings<931:950>|smartthings<939:950>|response<985:993>|response time<985:998>|kasa<1004:1008>|native<1011:1017>|native app<1011:1021>|smartthings<1055:1066>|three way<1078:1087>|dimmer<1088:1094>|configuration<1095:1108>|control<1132:1140>|power<1169:1174>|connect<1185:1194>|directly<1209:1217>|downside<1224:1232>|configuration<1241:1254>|dimmer<1267:1273>|manually<1287:1295>|internet<1304:1312>|response<1315:1323>|response time<1315:1328>|2 second<1364:1373>|second<1366:1373>|smartthings<1380:1391>|kasa<1399:1403>|reset<1423:1428>|device<1442:1449>|past<1457:1461>|6 month<1462:1470>|month<1464:1470>|however<1472:1479>|simple<1493:1499>|press<1503:1508>|press<1503:1511>|reset<1516:1521>|button<1522:1528>|the reset button<1512:1528>|reset button<1516:1528>|power<1540:1545>|cycle<1546:1552>|setting<1561:1568>|still<1573:1578>|dimmer<1590:1596>|dimmer<1590:1597>|weird<1609:1614>|behavior<1615:1623>|happen<1633:1641>|twice<1642:1647>|turn<1658:1662>|register<1689:1697>|include<1705:1714>|indicator<1719:1728>|indicator light<1719:1734>|still<1777:1782>|press<1803:1808>|again<1820:1825>|turn<1830:1834>|again<1862:1867>|again<1870:1875>|happen<1885:1893>|cycle<1925:1931>"

Even that is dim, it a bright light-in my peach black bedroom.  For sleep purposes I prefer zero light estimulación. I have not found an option to turn off this pilot light.  I put  a piece of electrical tape on the switch, even so, the pilot light leaks through the edges of the light switch .###feature<34:42>|pilot<80:85>|pilot light<80:91>|blue<101:105>|dim<135:138>|bright<145:151>|black<170:175>|bedroom<176:183>|sleep<190:195>|purpose<196:204>|prefer<207:213>|find<250:255>|an option<256:265>|option<259:265>|turn<269:273>|pilot<283:288>|pilot light<283:294>|put<299:302>|piece<306:311>|electrical<315:325>|pilot<359:364>|pilot light<359:370>|edge<389:394>",
      "Circle light on switch###circle<0:6>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2019-03-08] <b>Great switch, needs more smart actions</b> I installed 25 tp-link switches (combination of dimmer, switch, and 3 way switch) in my home, and one wemo dimmer.Installation: The tp-link dimmers and switches have different attachment hardware (where you screw the switch to attach it to the electric box in the wall). This is annoying because the switches have a thick plastic, while the dimmers are metal but have a piece of plastic that screws onto the top of the front which has to be removed. I personally prefer the dimmer metal hardware. When you install a dimmer next to a switch you have to really fiddle with them to make the two different sizes look the same after the cover is on.What I like:I really like the fact that I can control these from the switch, my phone, or the from google assistant.I also have a in wall wemo dimmer. When I tell google to turn off or on the lights the wemo is significantly slower to respond then the tp-link. For tp-link the lights start to turn on//off in probably .5 sec while the wemo dimmer may take 2-8 seconds to start to respond.Look - the switches and the covers have a bright shiny finish. In most cases I was not able to use the included cover as they are installed in double or triple switch settings, but I like them where I was able to use them.Light compatibility - I've installed these with multiple kinds of dimmable LED lights and they have all functioned well.Light range - I replaced my living room light which originally had the wemo dimmer switch  and I noticed that the tp-link uses a greater range of the light bulb - i.e. it dims more and 100% brightness is brigher which I like.These also pretty quickly reconnect to wifi after I flip the breaker off or power outage (unlike some of my other smart devices that I have to setup over an over again with every power blip)Enhancements I would really like:Enabling third party triggers. I use IFTTT to integrate multiple smart things together. While these dimmers are compatible with IFTTT - they are only able to be used as THAT devices (in the \"if this than that\"(ifttt) recipes). So for example, with my wemo switch, if I wanted to turn on/off some other smart device when I clicked the wemo dimmer switch, I could use the wemo click as a THIS action or trigger. But these switches I can only use to respond to other actions, for example, when my door sensor senses that the door opened I can turn on the entry way light.True Instant on/off: The dimmer switches have a setting where you can change how fast they dim on and off when you click the switch. One option is \"Instant\". When I have it set to instant, it really just dims on/off fast. I have a non dimmer switch right next to a dimmer switch and when I click both at the same time the dimmer light takes longer, probably a second to turn on, while the non-dimmable switch is instant. This would also probably help with non-dimmable lights. I had non-dimmable lights attached to some of my dimmers and these acted very poorly even when set to instant on. They really buzzed and some even continued to buzz loudly while on.Always on circle  light in switch - In places where I have three dimmers together, when I turn one light on, that switches circle on the switch turns off. When I go to turn the light off I instantly think that the switches with the light on are the ones that are on, so I click those two only to find that neither of those lights were on and end up cycling through all three switches.In the kasa app when you select a dimmer or a switch the UI is completely different, it would be nice for them to be more similar.What I don't like -The click. About 1 out of every 4 times that I click the switch it doesn't turn on/off. Probably similar to learning to double click on a computer mouse for the first time (for those that can remember that). This could also probably be resolved with the instant on/off I mentioned before. Because it takes about a second even on instant on for the light to come to full power, when you click on and didn't click hard enough you end up walking past the switch thinking it is just takings its second to dim on, but then you have to walk back to the switch once it actually doesn't work. Some of my switches also have a bit of a squeaky click, which is also annoying.Note about 3-way switches - Even though my house was built fairly recently, for every set of three way switches, only one of the two wall wirings has the white wire. Luckily these can be paired with an old dumb three way switch and work quite well (i.e. you can use a single 2 pack of 3-way switches for two separate sets of 3-way sockets)Note about wifi - I have mesh wifi in a smallish house so my wifi coverage is good throughout and wifi connectivity has not been an issue for switches.Update Feb 2020:Smart actions - Auto off action. I really like this feature. I have my bathroom vent fans set to auto off after 15 minutes, and I think it has always worked except for one time my WiFi was down. The problem, your only allowed 3 smart actions. I’d love to be able to set more. My son uses the bathroom at the far end of my house and leaves the light on every time. A 15 minute auto off would be perfect. It would also work for closet and hallway lights. TP-link please add more smart actions.###smart<28:33>|action<34:40>|action<34:41>|smart action<28:41>|install<48:55>|all<52:55>|instal<48:57>|tp<61:63>|link<64:68>|tp link<61:68>|tp link

It has plenty of options to make the switch and dimmer work the way you want it. Not any more difficult to install than a receptacle, however be aware these are at least 50% bigger than a normal light switch, so you may need to extend your existing electrical box or replace it with a new one. It all works great. My only suggestion to Leviton would be to put the locator light behind the top center of the rocker switch so it’s easy to tell where to press in the dark.###support<3:11>|matter<12:18>|plenty<27:33>|feature<37:45>|support<59:67>|matter<68:74>|major<100:105>|smart<106:111>|assistant<112:122>|plenty<131:137>|option<141:148>|dimmer<172:178>|difficult<218:227>|install<231:238>|receptacle<246:256>|however<258:265>|aware<269:274>|least<288:293>|big<298:304>|normal<312:318>|a normal light<310:324>|normal light switch<312:331>|exist<364:372>|electrical<373:383>|electrical box<373:387>|box<384:387>|replace<391:398>|new<409:412>|new one<409:416>|a new one<407:416>|one<413:416>|suggestion<446:456>|leviton<460:467>|put<480:483>|locator<488:495>|locator light<488:501>|top<513:516>|center<517:523>|rocker<531:537>|rocker switch<531:544>|easy<553:557>|press<575:580>|dark<588:592>",

The problem is the design language. Say a TP link switch has a light right at the spot where you know you have to touch it in a dark room. Or you might not even see the switch but physically you can decipher its control logic. Not this thing. It is completely flat and the light is nowhere near what you want to hit. There is nothing to guide your eyes or your hands . More than a few times now I have just bludgeoned this thing.

      "Dim indicator LED###dim<0:3>|dim indicator<0:13>|indicator<4:13>|lead<14:17>|||B079775ZZQ ★★☆☆☆ [2023-01-14] <b>Not the best design and no web interface. Requires app for install and updates.</b> These are smart / WiFi dimmers that are hard-wired into a junction box for switched lights.Only supports 2.4 Ghz WifI band -- some of the hardware variants used in individual dimmers will stay connected indefinitely and some will disconnect and reconnect randomly and as frequently every few minutes.  It apparently has to do with the WiFi chips, firmware, or both.Sometimes the brightness level LEDs on the top if the dimmer will get stuck and stay on and at other times, they turn off after a few seconds.Alexa integration is OK for basic functions, but gets complicated rapidly as the number of named devices increases. You will need to come up with creative names if, for example, you have more than one dimmer per named room and then you will have to remember which are which. There is no alexa integration for calibration. firmware updates, or time or time zone adjustments.These dimmers work for most light sources:  incandescent (but wattage is limited to 200) and some dimmable fluorescent and some LED bulbs.Requires an app for initial installation, dimmer calibration, and for firmware or time updates.There is no easy reference source on the product page for bulb compatibility, so be sure you test your bulbs before going to the trouble to install these dimmers.Worked poorly on Feit LED candelabra bulbs: there was noticeable bulb flickering at dimming levels below 60 percent.Single pole (one switch) only.  Requires a neutral and ground connection, so there will be four wire connections per dimmer (green, white, and two for the controlled device).  Oddly, the green and white connections require wire nuts but the line and load are screwed into the side of the dimmer.Large back cover uses a lot of space in the junction box, so not the best choice for small or crowded junction boxes.The front up and down controls are too small and should be bigger.The indicator LED bulb is very dim and cannot be seen in a bright room.  A dimmable indicator on a dimmer would have been be a logical design choice, but it's not available on this model.There still is no web interface for these smart dimmers -- only app controls.  The Apple app does not support accessibility options and is not suitable for those with vision issues -- moreover, the contrast and size on the app screens is very poor even for those with good vision -- especially if your Apple device uses adaptive backlighting.There is a removable, screwless faceplate which is a nice feature. The face plate and switch front are a high gloss finish that shows fingerprints and scratches; a matte finish would be much better.There are two very small, unmarked and hard-to-access switches built into the dimmer bottom.  One reboots the dimmer without removing the programming and account information. The other wipes the device and removes it from an account.For those who prefer a flawless installation, be sure that the dimmer is not angled when you screw it into the junction box.  If there is any angle, the face plate will not fit flush with the dimmer. This is especially important if there are more than one switch or dimmer in a junction box.###design<16:22>|web<30:33>|interface<34:43>|face<39:43>|require<45:53>|install<62:69>|update<74:81>|smart<97:102>|wifi<105:109>|dim<110:113>|dimmer<110:116>|dimmer<110:117>|hard<127:131>|wire<132:136>|wire<132:137>|junction<145:153>|box<154:157>|junction

      "Dim indicator light###dim<0:3>|dim indicator<0:13>|indicator<4:13>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2022-01-13] <b>SMART THINGS ecosystem - HowTo</b> General:All manufacture’s devices must work with one app… SMART THINGS which is supported by Android and Apple is my choice! See final comment below to know why… Alex support is not enough.The TreatLife directions says:- Use TreatLife App but it does NOT work with SMART THINGS! it is isolated from eco systems.- Use SMART LIFE app, I can get SMART THINGS to connect with this app, but the TreatLife dimmer device is never imported to SMART THINGs… so do NOT use SMART LIFE.-DO USE the TUYA app and SMART THINGS does import the Treat life 3way dimmer! The device is fully operational from SMART THINGS.. very good !HOW TO:The device is fully installed mechanical and 120V powered up is starting point. Simple test confirms this by pushing or flipping all 3way, 4way and wifi switches with you fingers. All works like a 100 years ago wiring!Install TYUA SMART app, exit it.Push wifi dimmer button and hold for 5 seconds, a very faint, almost invisible red flashes at ½ seconds.  I could barely see this blinkling light after several tries. very  very dim!Run TUYA app to add device (+ sign) follow instructions till device added. Be sure you have the wifi ID you expect.  Test turn lights on and off to be sure this app has found and registerd your 3way dimmer.Run the SMART THINGS app and add device WiFi switch then choose “byBrand” choose TUYA SMART and follow app prompts.  Be sure to choose room.  I have a lot of smart home devices, so look for device not by room by ALL DEVICES sorted alphabeticallyTest by on-ing and off-ing the deviceHaving an umbrella or eco system app rather than one by each manufacturer is easier to use.  SMART THINGS is my choice because it is easy to use and works on Android, Apple and PCs.  It works with Alexa too, though I am not a fan of voice assistants, they are annoying when I have company over, my wife is annoyed too. If you ever sell your home having a single simple control app that works with APPLE or ANDROID could enable the sale.  Using individual manufacturer apps, could be a problem, they may not even be in business in a few years.  TUYA is an industry consortium(?) that provides software to many manufacturers… a better industry survival chance for an app.  Imagine if in 10 years TreatLife and its servers are gone and what it does your home’s value.FLAW:I think the brightness of the blinking red alert LED is a serious flaw. I can barely see it.NOTE:I bench test all IOT before ripping out my home wiring using 3way, 4way, different kind of lights, differ wire lengths (up to 200 feet between switches). Not all devices and apps work as advertised. see pix.ED###smart<3:8>|things<9:15>|smart things<3:15>|ecosystem<16:25>|system<19:25>|general<38:45>|manufacture<50:61>|device<64:70>|device<64:71>|smart<96:101>|things<102:108>|smart things<96:108>|support<118:125>|support<118:127>|android<131:138>|apple<143:148>|choice<155:161>|final<167:172>|comment<173:180>|support<205:212>|treatlife<231:240>|direction<241:251>|treatlife<263:272>|smart<303:308>|things<309:315>|smart things<303:315>|system<341:347>|smart<355:360>|life<361:365>|smart<381:386>|smart things<381:393>|things<387:393>|connect<397:404>|treatlife<428:437>|dimmer<438:444>|device<445:451>|never<455:460>|ever<456:460>|smart<473:478>|things<479:485>|smart things<473:485>|smart<501:506>|life<507:511>|tuya<524:528>|smart<537:542>|smart things<537:549>|things<543:549>|life<572:576>|dimmer<582:588>|device<594:600>|fully<604:609>|operational<610:621>|smart<627:632>|things<633:639>|smart things<627:639>|device<664:670>|fully<674:679>|instal<680:689>|mechanical<690:700>|red<714:717>|power<710:717>|start<724:732>|point<733:738>|simple<740:746>|test<747:751>|confirm<752:760>|push<769:776>|flip<780:788>|wifi<808:812>|finger<831:838>|year<861:866>|ago<867:870>|wiring<871:877>|smart<891:896>|push<910:914>|wifi<915:919>|dimmer<920:926>|button<927:933>|hold<938:942>|second<949:956>|5 second<947:956>|faint<965:970>|almost<972:978>|red<989:992>|flash<993:1000>|second<1006:1013>|barely<1024:1030>|ever<1063:1067>|run<1092:1095>|tuya<1096:1100>|add<1108:1111>|device<1112:1118>|sign<1122:1126>|follow<1128:1134>|instruction<1135:1147>|device<1153:1159>|add<1160:1163>|add<1160:1165>|wifi<1188:1192>|test<1209:1213>|turn<1214:1218>|find<1261:1266>|dimmer<1291:1297>|run<1298:1301>|smart<1306:1311>|things<1312:1318>|smart things<1306:1318>|add<1327:1330>|device<1331:1337>|wifi<1338:1342>|choose<1355:1361>|choose<1372:1378>|tuya<1379:1383>|smart<1384:1389>|follow<1394:1400>|prompt<1405:1412>|choose<1426:1432>|room<1433:1437>|smart<1456:1461>|smart home<1456:1466>|home<1462:1466>|device<1467:1473>|device<1467:1474>|smart home device<1456:1474>|device<1488:1494>|room<1502:1506>|sort<1522:1528>|test<1543:1547>|device<1574:1580>|system<1606:1612>|manufacture<1641:1652>|manufacturer<1641:1653>|easy<1657:1663>|smart<1673:1678>|smart things<1673:1685>|things<1679:1685>|choice<1692:1698>|easy<1713:1717>|android<1738:1745>|apple<1747:1752>|alexa<1777:1782>|fan<1806:1809>|voice<1813:1818>|voice assistant<1813:1829>|assistant<1819:1829>|annoying<1840:1848>|company<1861:1868>|wife<1878:1882>|annoy<1886:1893>|ever<1906:1910>|sell<1911:1915>|home<1921:1925>|single<1935:1941>|simple<1942:1948>|control<1949:1956>|apple<1977:1982>|android<1986:1993>|enable<2000:2006>|sale<2011:2015>|individual<2024:2034>|manufacture<2035:2046>|manufacturer<2035:2047>|problem<2065:2072>|business<2098:2106>|year<2116:2121>|a few year<2110:2121>|few year<2112:2121>|tuya<2124:2128>|provide<2163:2171>|software<2172:2180>|manufacture<2189:2200>|manufacturer<2189:2201>|manufacturer<2189:2202>|chance<2231:2237>|imagine<2251:2258>|year<2268:2273>|treatlife<2274:2283>|server<2292:2299>|home<2331:2335>|value<2338:2343>|flaw<2344:2348>|brightness<2361:2371>|blink<2379:2387>|red<2388:2391>|led<2398:2401>|flaw<2415:2419>|barely<2427:2433>|note<2441:2445>|test<2454:2458>|iot<2463:2466>|rip<2474:2481>|home<2489:2493>|wiring<2494:2500>|different<2519:2528>|kind<2529:2533>|wire<2552:2556>|length<2557:2564>|foot<2576:2580>|device<2608:2614>|device<2608:2615>|advertise<2633:2643>"

      "Small lights on the switch###small<0:5>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★☆☆ [2020-09-15] <b>Know your Bulbs! Dimmer not working for mine.</b> I like tp-link Kasa products. I have several. I purchased this dimmer to control my under-cabinet kitchen LED lights. Installation was as easy as any other switch. The switch connected easily to the Kasa app and to Alexa. Unfortunately, the dimming function does not work either by manual control or by Alexa. More accurately, it appears to work as the little lights on the switch change when manually operated, and the app appears to be working on my phone, but the lights do no react. They remain either fully on, or fully off. This is my own fault however, as I am ignorant of the complexities related to dimming of bulbs. I was not aware that there are several different means by which bulbs can be dimmed, and this appears to be even more critical with LED's Without getting into too much detail, this switch will not diim my LED lights which are permanently installed Low Voltage LED's.A lot of people have reported on the net having the same problem as mine; some have reported blinking, others buzzing, etc. So, searched on the TP-Link web site and finally found some factual information in a response from one of the tp-link techs. Here it is:Apparently the issue may be the method of dimming the bulbs support.HS220 supports dimmable incandescent and LED lights based on TRIAC and forward-phase-control, and does not support lamps based on PWM (pulse width modulation) and ELV (electronic low voltage) dimming. It is recommended to contact the bulb manufacturers to see what dimming methods are supported.{end}So, there is really no problem with the switch. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. However, I do wish that tp-link included this information in the product documentation. I read those documents before purchasing and I saw no such qualifications for this device. And, this is the reason for my three star rating for this product. I could have avoided this purchase with more info upfront.Know your bulbs, or you may repeat my experience! Regardless, I like tp-link; I'll just do more homework next time.###bulbs<13:18>|dimmer<20:26>|tp<60:62>|link<63:67>|tp link<60:67>|kasa<68:72>|link kasa<63:72>|tp link kasa<60:72>|dimmer<116:122>|control<126:133>|cabinet<143:150>|kitchen<151:158>|led<159:162>|lead<159:162>|led light<159:169>|installation<171:183>|easy<191:195>|connect<228:237>|easily<238:244>|kasa<252:256>|the kasa app<248:260>|kasa app<252:260>|alexa<268:273>|unfortunately<275:288>|dimming<294:301>|dim<294:301>|function<302:310>|either<325:331>|manual<335:341>|manual control<335:349>|control<342:349>|alexa<356:361>|appear<383:390>|change<434:440>|manual<446:452>|manually<446:454>|operate<455:463>|appear<477:484>|phone<505:510>|remain<545:551>|either<552:558>|fully<559:564>|fully<572:577>|own<594:597>|fault<598:603>|however<604:611>|relate<650:657>|dim<661:668>|dimming<661:668>|bulb<672:676>|bulb<672:677>|bulbs<672:677>|aware<689:694>|different<718:727>|mean<728:733>|bulb<743:747>|bulbs<743:748>|bulb<743:748>|dim<756:762>|appear<773:780>|critical<797:805>|led<811:814>|lead<811:814>|detail<847:853>|lead<884:887>|led<884:887>|led light<884:894>|instal<917:926>|low<927:930>|voltage<931:938>|low voltage<927:938>|led<939:942>|lead<939:942>|lot of people<947:960>|people<954:960>|report<966:974>|same<997:1001>|problem<1002:1009>|report<1029:1037>|link<1039:1043>|blink<1038:1046>|buzz<1055:1062>|search<1073:1081>|tp<1089:1091>|tp link<1089:1096>|link<1092:1096>|the tp link<1085:1096>|web<1097:1100>|site<1101:1105>|finally<1110:1117>|find<1118:1123>|info<1137:1141>|information<1137:1148>|response<1154:1162>|tp<1179:1181>|tp link<1179:1186>|the tp link<1175:1186>|link<1182:1186>|tech<1187:1192>|apparently<1205:1215>|issue<1220:1225>|method<1237:1243>|dim<1247:1254>|dimming<1247:1254>|bulb<1259:1263>|bulbs<1259:1264>|bulb<1259:1264>|support<1265:1272>|support<1279:1286>|support<1279:1287>|dimmable<1288:1296>|incandescent<1297:1309>|led<1314:1317>|lead<1314:1317>|led light<1314:1324>|base<1325:1330>|triac<1334:1339>|forward<1344:1351>|phase<1352:1357>|control<1358:1365>|support<1380:1387>|lamp<1388:1393>|base<1394:1399>|pwm<1403:1406>|elv<1436:1439>|electronic<1441:1451>|low<1452:1455>|voltage<1456:1463>|low voltage<1452:1463>|dimming<1465:1472>|dim<1465:1472>|recommend<1480:1491>|contact<1495:1502>|bulb<1507:1511>|manufacturer<1512:1525>|dimming<1538:1545>|dim<1538:1545>|method<1546:1552>|method<1546:1553>|support<1558:1565>|problem<1596:1603>|no problem<1593:1603>|suppose<1648:1656>|however<1664:1671>|wish<1678:1682>|tp<1688:1690>|link<1691:1695>|tp link<1688:1695>|include<1696:1704>|info<1710:1714>|information<1710:1721>|documentation<1737:1750>|read<1754:1758>|device<1835:1841>|reason<1860:1866>|avoid<1923:1930>|info<1955:1959>|bulb<1978:1982>|bulbs<1978:1983>|bulb<1978:1983>|repeat<1996:2002>|experience<2006:2016>|regardless<2018:2028>|tp<2037:2039>|tp link<2037:2044>|link<2040:2044>|next<2073:2077>|next time<2073:2082>",

      "Small light on each switch###small<0:5>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2023-11-12] <b>A GLOWING Review!</b> While remodeling our home I decided to convert as much of our home as possible to Smart technology and hand in hand with Alexa, I had Kasa plugs, Kasa Dimmer Switches and Kasa Three Way Dimmer Switches added which has my entire downstairs, front entry and back patio all controlled by the Kasa app or as I prefer, Alexa. Installation was done by my contractor so I can’t gauge how easy it is for the average homeowner to do. He relayed to me that it was as easy as adding any dimmer switch with the only challenge being fitting everything in where there were two or more switches side by side. Aside from the tight fit in some of the switch boxes it was a snap and having them sync with the Kasa app wouldn’t have been easier because the app walks you through set up in seconds. Alexa automatically discovered every Kasa device from the plug controlling my outdoor string lights to the switches throughout the house. The Kasa switches have a sleek modern look and for my spouse who prefers a physical switch the small light on each switch is just enough to help you find the switch in the dark. The response time between a command to Alexa and the action taking place is immediate and so far there’s been no issue.  I’ve had them all installed now for a few weeks and couldn’t be happier.###remodel<31:41>|home<46:50>|decide<53:60>|convert<64:71>|home<87:91>|possible<95:103>|smart<107:112>|technology<113:123>|hand<128:132>|hand<136:140>|alexa<146:151>|kasa<159:163>|plug<164:168>|plug<164:169>|kasa<171:175>|dimmer<176:182>|dimmer switches<176:191>|switches<183:191>|kasa<196:200>|three<201:206>|three way<201:210>|dimmer<211:217>|dimmer switches<211:226>|switches<218:226>|add<227:232>|entire<246:252>|front<265:270>|back<281:285>|control<296:306>|kasa<314:318>|the kasa app<310:322>|kasa app<314:322>|prefer<331:337>|alexa<339:344>|installation<346:358>|contractor<374:384>|easy<406:410>|average<425:432>|home<433:437>|relay<453:460>|easy<482:486>|add<490:496>|dimmer<501:507>|challenge<529:538>|fit<545:548>|fit<545:552>|side<605:609>|side<613:617>|side by side<605:617>|side<620:624>|tight<634:639>|fit<640:643>|tight fit<634:643>|box<666:671>|snap<681:685>|sync<702:706>|kasa<716:720>|kasa app<716:724>|the kasa app<712:724>|easy<744:750>|walk<767:772>|set<785:788>|second<795:802>|alexa<804:809>|automatically<810:823>|discover<824:834>|kasa<841:845>|device<846:852>|plug<862:866>|control<867:878>|outdoor<882:889>|string<890:896>|string light<890:903>|house<935:940>|kasa<946:950>|sleek<967:972>|modern<973:979>|modern look<973:984>|prefer<1007:1013>|prefer<1007:1014>|physical<1017:1025>|physical switch<1017:1032>|small<1037:1042>|help<1082:1086>|find<1091:1095>|dark<1114:1118>|response<1124:1132>|response time<1124:1137>|command<1148:1155>|alexa<1159:1164>|action<1173:1179>|place<1187:1192>|far<1213:1216>|issue<1233:1238>|no issue<1230:1238>|instal<1259:1268>|now<1269:1272>|few week<1279:1288>|a few week<1277:1288>|week<1283:1288>|happy<1305:1312>",

They are easy to control, have a nice solid feel when you press them, and I really like the glow they emit when off so you can find them in the dark. My only complaint is that these dimmers were very hard to fit into the electrical box when I installed them. They were standard ganged metal boxes (3 ganged together) and the contour of them interlocking parts interfered with the switch housing. I eventually made it work by swapping the 2 dimmers around with the 1 single pole I was putting in, but it was a major headache. Would be nice if Kasa gave a little more wiggle room on the housing. Even swapping boxes out wouldn't have helped since the issue was height and not depth. But now they're in and I'm very happy.###tight<16:21>|a tight fit<14:25>|tight fit<16:25>|fit<22:25>|box<33:36>|kasa<55:59>|dimmer<75:81>|these dimmer switch<69:90>|exception<98:107>|easy<118:122>|control<126:133>|solid<147:152>|feel<153:157>|press<167:172>|glow<201:205>|find<236:240>|dark<253:257>|complaint<267:276>|only complaint<262:276>|dimmer<291:297>|dimmer<291:298>|hard<309:313>|fit<317:320>|electrical<330:340>|box<341:344>|electrical box<330:344>|the electrical box<326:344>|instal<352:361>|standard<378:386>|gang<387:393>|metal<394:399>|box<400:403>|metal box<394:405>|box<400:405>|gang<409:415>|together<416:424>|part<463:468>|interfere<469:479>|housing<496:503>|eventually<507:517>|swap<534:542>|dimmer<549:555>|dimmer<549:556>|single<575:581>|single pole<575:586>|pole<582:586>|put<593:600>|major<618:623>|headache<624:632>|kasa<651:655>|give<656:660>|room<682:686>|housing<694:701>|swap<708:716>|box<717:720>|box<717:722>|help<741:747>|issue<758:763>|depth<783:788>|now<794:797>|happy<822:827>",
      "Circular light on the switch|||B079775ZZQ ★★☆☆☆ [2025-02-26] <b>KASA Warranty Concern</b> I purchased a large number of KASA smart switches for my new home, and have generally been satisfied with their operation.  Unfortunately, one of the HS220 switches recently failed, after having functioned normally for about 14 months.Once the switch stopped working, the switch itself appeared normal - with the circular light on the switch turning on and off as the switch was depressed.  The switch, however, no longer turned the attached 2 LED ceiling lights on or off via any of the 3 modes: depressing the switch, via the KASA App on my phone or via voice commands (Alexa).  Resetting the switch did not correct the problem, nor did turning power off at the breaker panel for ~1 minute.  Once removed, the body of the switch showed no signs of discoloration that might suggest that any of the internal circuitry had overheated.In contacting KASA for replacement of the switch under their 2-year warranty, I was given various options to return the defective switch - all of which requiring me to spend at least $14.99 (or much more) to replace the failed switch for which I paid $14.96 for when new.  The current price for a new HS220 switch on Amazon is $16.99.  Since KASA was unwilling to simply provide a no-cost return shipping label, I purchased a new HS220 switch from Amazon, and the new switch is operating normally.  I sincerely hope that the remaining 20+ KASA smart switches that I have installed do not exhibit such failures, as I would like to continue to utilize switches from a single manufacturer to simplify operation of my \"smart\" home.It is unfortunate that KASA has little interest in obtaining failed, lower price items (such as switches), both to permit them to understand the root cause of such fails and to retain customer satisfaction and loyalty.###kasa<3:7>|warranty<8:16>|concern<17:24>|large<43:48>|number<49:55>|kasa<59:63>|smart<64:69>|kasa smart switch<59:78>|new<86:89>|home<90:94>|generally<105:114>|satisfied<120:129>|operation<141:150>|unfortunately<153:166>|recently<194:202>|fail<203:209>|function<224:234>|normal<235:241>|normally<235:243>|month<257:263>|once<264:268>|stop<280:287>|appear<315:323>|normal<324:330>|turn<371:378>|however<432:439>|long<444:450>|turn<451:457>|attach<462:470>|led<473:476>|led ceiling<473:484>|ceiling<477:484>|led ceiling light<473:491>|ceiling light<477:491>|mode<519:524>|kasa<557:561>|kasa app<557:565>|the kasa app<553:565>|phone<572:577>|voice<585:590>|command<591:599>|voice command<585:599>|alexa<601:606>|reset<610:619>|correct<639:646>|problem<651:658>|turn<668:675>|power<676:681>|breaker<693:700>|panel<701:706>|minute<714:720>|once<723:727>|remove<728:735>|body<741:745>|show<760:766>|sign<770:775>|suggest<804:811>|internal<828:836>|overheat<851:861>|contact<865:875>|kasa<876:880>|replace<885:892>|replacement<885:896>|2 year<923:929>|year<925:929>|year warranty<925:938>|warranty<930:938>|give<946:951>|various<952:959>|option<960:967>|return<971:977>|defective<982:991>|require<1014:1023>|spend<1030:1035>|least<1039:1044>|replace<1070:1077>|fail<1082:1088>|pay<1108:1112>|new<1129:1132>|current<1139:1146>|price<1147:1152>|new<1159:1162>|kasa<1204:1208>|simply<1226:1232>|provide<1233:1240>|cost<1246:1250>|return<1251:1257>|shipping<1258:1266>|label<1267:1272>|new<1288:1291>|new<1326:1329>|operate<1340:1349>|normal<1350:1356>|normally<1350:1358>|hope<1373:1377>|remain<1387:1396>|kasa<1401:1405>|smart<1406:1411>|kasa smart switch<1401:1420>|instal<1433:1442>|failure<1463:1471>|continue<1492:1500>|single<1528:1534>|manufacturer<1535:1547>|operation<1560:1569>|smart<1577:1582>|home<1584:1588>|smart home<1577:1588>|kasa<1612:1616>|fail<1650:1656>|low<1658:1663>|price<1664:1669>|understand<1719:1729>|cause<1739:1744>|fail<1753:1758>|customer<1773:1781>",
      "Green LED light###green<0:5>|lead<6:9>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★★☆ [2022-03-14] <b>Failures at 2 yr mark</b> There are much cheaper switches BUT this is the only decora style switch with 'up is on, down is off' functionally. The $15 alternatives all have a simple toggle, press down to turn the light on or off. It's that with the extra $30-35 bucks? I thought so however...I've got more than a dozen of these in my house, along with another 20 of the companion switches for three way setups and I've had 4 or 5 fail after two years. They just stop working. The app shows they function, the switch still has the green led light, connects to the WiFi, and responds to the app BUT won't turn the light on.The first two times this happened, i opened a ticket and to their credit, Leviton shipped me a replacement even though it was 25 or 26 months after I bought them. But the next few times, it happened, I bought replacements. My wife requires the 'up turns it on' functionally but relaxing these things every few years is exhausting even if Leviton support has been good. If they were $15, i don't think I would be as bothered but at the $45+ dollar premium I probably will push my wife to accept the cheaper alternatives.###failure<3:11>|mark<20:24>|cheap<44:51>|decora<82:88>|style<89:94>|down<118:122>|function<131:139>|alternative<153:165>|simple<177:183>|toggle<184:190>|press<192:197>|down<198:202>|turn<206:210>|extra<251:256>|buck<264:269>|however<284:291>|a dozen<313:320>|dozen<315:320>|house<336:341>|companion<372:381>|three way<395:404>|setup<405:411>|fail<432:436>|two year<443:452>|year<447:452>|stop<464:468>|show<486:491>|function<497:505>|still<518:523>|green<532:537>|lead<538:541>|connect<549:557>|wifi<565:569>|respond<575:583>|turn<605:609>|first<627:632>|happen<648:656>|open<660:666>|leviton<697:704>|ship<705:712>|replacement<718:729>|month<758:764>|next<794:798>|happen<813:821>|replacement<832:843>|replacement<832:844>|wife<849:853>|require<854:862>|turn<871:875>|turn<871:876>|function<884:892>|few year<929:938>|year<933:938>|exhaust<942:952>|leviton<961:968>|support<969:976>|bother<1038:1046>|dollar<1063:1069>|premium<1070:1077>|probably<1080:1088>|push<1094:1098>|wife<1102:1106>|accept<1110:1116>|cheap<1121:1128>|alternative<1129:1141>"

They still work as a regular non-smart switch except they have an annoying WIFI logo in the front.I also try as test moving to a location closer to the Modem. It did not work. At least 3 of them are in location with multiple switches and the other ones appear to be working properly for the time been.I try Kasa support and have being dealing with them for over 2 weeks. They have me sent them information regarding every switch, model, hardware version, firmware version, even photos of the installation wiring. My guess is a problematic firmware update but they have not been able to tell me what is happening, oh, yes today one smart bulb from Kasa is failing also, or even if this is going to continue.I am still waiting for an answer.###support<34:41>|ask<63:66>|month<72:77>|ago<78:81>|answer<104:110>|probably<111:119>|stay<204:211>|home<212:216>|decide<220:227>|start<231:236>|year<250:254>|old<255:258>|old house<255:264>|house<259:264>|re<267:269>|smart<271:276>|install<281:288>|kasa<305:309>|smart<310:315>|kasa smart switch<305:324>|include<332:341>|single<342:348>|pole<349:353>|single pole<342:353>|dimmer<355:362>|mainly<363:369>|perfectly<381:390>|month<403:408>|month<403:409>|5 month<401:409>|month<419:424>|ago<425:428>|one<429:432>|fail<441:447>|stop<452:456>|connect<457:467>|wifi<475:479>|total<512:517>|dimmer<526:533>|single<540:546>|single pole<540:551>|pole<547:551>|pole<547:552>|single pole<540:552>|one<577:580>|re<582:584>|reset<582:591>|device<596:602>|modem<609:614>|re<616:618>|install<619:626>|instal<619:629>|wifi<646:650>|connection<651:661>|wifi connection<646:661>|still<668:673>|re<684:686>|regular<684:691>|non<692:695>|smart<696:701>|non smart switch<692:708>|annoying<729:737>|wifi<738:742>|front<755:760>|test<775:779>|move<780:786>|location<792:800>|close<801:807>|modem<815:820>|least<842:847>|re<859:861>|location<865:873>|multiple<879:887>|one<911:914>|one<911:915>|appear<916:922>|properly<937:945>|kasa<970:974>|support<975:982>|deal<998:1005>|week<1027:1032>|2 week<1025:1032>|send<1047:1051>|information<1057:1068>|re<1069:1071>|regard<1069:1078>|model<1093:1098>|hardware<1100:1108>|re<1106:1108>|version<1109:1116>|hardware version<1100:1116>|re<1124:1126>|firmware<1118:1126>|version<1127:1134>|firmware version<1118:1134>|photo<1141:1147>|install<1155:1162>|installation<1155:1167>|wiring<1168:1174>|guess<1179:1184>|problematic<1190:1201>|re<1208:1210>|firmware<1202:1210>|update<1211:1217>|firmware update<1202:1217>|able<1241:1245>|happen<1265:1274>|today<1284:1289>|one<1290:1293>|smart<1294:1299>|bulb<1300:1304>|kasa<1310:1314>|fail<1318:1325>|continue<1360:1368>|still<1374:1379>|wait<1380:1387>|answer<1395:1401>",
      "Micro font labeling on switch back###micro<0:5>|back<30:34>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2023-01-14] <b>Instillation still a work in progress</b> Installed the HS220 on a single gang box.  \"Follow app installation instructions\" was what was said.  The neutral and ground was easily attached and wires were shoved to back of the oversized box.  Clue to determine the Line and Load wire was helpful, but app doesn't identify which switch screw was which.  Only squinting at the back of the switch could I see the labeling in a micro font.  Screwing to wall completed but be warned----this switch takes up way too much room in the box.  Had this box not already been recessed, Im not sure I could have attached it to the box.  The obstacle to completing the installation is how to reattached the plate.  Loosening the switch from the box hasn't helped reattachment.  Still playing with calibrating brightness.  Telling Alexa to dim to 20% or 100% seems to work.Pros:Connecting the wifi and attaching to Alexa was simple.  Expect it to automatically reattach as other Kasa products do when power goes outSmall location circle helps to find it the dark.Cons:Device is way too thick and needs too much room in the box.  I bought this for my kitchen but too many wires in the box prevented installation so I installed in a secondary location.Difficulty in reattaching the plate after installation in a single gang box. --  Still working on this###still<5:10>|still<16:21>|instal<45:54>|single<70:76>|single gang<70:81>|a single gang<68:81>|gang<77:81>|gang box<77:85>|box<82:85>|single gang box<70:85>|follow<89:95>|installation<100:112>|instruction<113:125>|installation instruction<100:125>|neutral<151:158>|ground<163:169>|easily<174:180>|attach<181:189>|wire<194:198>|wire<194:199>|back<215:219>|oversized<227:236>|box<237:240>|determine<251:260>|line<265:269>|load<274:278>|load wire<274:283>|wire<279:283>|helpful<288:295>|identify<313:321>|screw<335:340>|back<375:379>|micro<424:429>|screw<437:445>|wall<449:453>|complete<454:463>|room<515:519>|box<527:530>|box<542:545>|already<550:557>|recess<563:571>|attach<598:606>|box<617:620>|complete<639:649>|installation<654:666>|attach<679:687>|plate<692:697>|box<730:733>|help<741:747>|still<763:768>|play<769:776>|calibrate<782:793>|brightness<794:804>|alexa<815:820>|dim<824:827>|pro<857:861>|connect<862:872>|wifi<877:881>|attach<886:895>|alexa<899:904>|simple<909:915>|automatically<931:944>|kasa<963:967>|other kasa product<957:976>|power<985:990>|location<1005:1013>|circle<1014:1020>|help<1021:1026>|find<1030:1034>|dark<1042:1046>|con<1047:1051>|device<1052:1058>|thick<1070:1075>|room<1095:1099>|box<1107:1110>|kitchen<1134:1141>|wire<1155:1159>|wire<1155:1160>|box<1168:1171>|prevent<1172:1181>|installation<1182:1194>|instal<1200:1209>|location<1225:1233>|difficulty<1234:1244>|attach<1250:1259>|plate<1264:1269>|installation<1276:1288>|single<1294:1300>|a single gang<1292:1305>|single gang<1294:1305>|gang<1301:1305>|box<1306:1309>|gang box<1301:1309>|single gang box<1294:1309>|still<1315:1320>"

I then started to get notice from Alexa that \"Overhead\" does not support that function. I do not know if there was a change to the Firmware or what but the old one just stopped working. All the options worked in the KASA app but lost abilities when trying to function with ALEXA.So I thought that maybe due to the tight space of running a off/on switch for my Front Porch (a different brand of Smart-switch) and this one, maybe, just may be the unit overheated and burnt the nextwork wi-fi.I purchased this unit early November 23 and finally talked myself into replacing the malfunctioning one. To combat the heat function I removed to old 2-gang box and put in a 3-gang box to allow for some cooling space.Set up the new unit and removed the old from the apps - reinstalled and seems to work with KASA app. Spoke to my ECHO to turn on 'Overhead' and was told that \"overhead\" does not support that! Trying to turn in on via voice - won't work.Don't know if they changed something in the Firmware but Both Units (old and new) are acting the same and ALEXA fails to activate via voice - only reply \"does not support that function\" I can use the ALEXA phone app to manually turn off, turn on or dim.One user suggested the fix is to wipe the app and reinstall. I do not care to fix a known flaw by having to reset ALL my Devices or start over whenever I add a new echo unit or KASA device. I don't think i will be adding too many more KASA devices.SIMPLY PUT THIS MAYBE COMPATIBLE BUT IT WILL REQUIRE HOURS OF EXTRA WORK AND THAN THERE IS NOT PROMISE TO KEEP IT WORKING.  i AM SENDING THIS BACK.###wi<18:20>|alexa<23:28>|one<43:46>|back<66:70>|month<102:108>|several month<94:108>|year<111:115>|start<124:129>|start<124:131>|notice<139:145>|alexa<151:156>|overhead<163:171>|support<182:189>|function<195:203>|change<234:240>|firmware<248:256>|old<273:276>|one<277:280>|stop<286:293>|option<311:318>|kasa<333:337>|kasa app<333:341>|the kasa app<329:341>|lose<346:350>|ability<351:360>|function<376:384>|wi<385:387>|alexa<390:395>|tight<431:436>|space<437:442>|run<446:453>|wi<464:466>|front<477:482>|front porch<477:488>|porch<483:488>|different<492:501>|different brand<492:507>|a different brand<490:507>|brand<502:507>|smart<511:516>|wi<518:520>|one<534:537>|unit<562:566>|heat<571:575>|overheat<567:577>|burn<582:587>|wi<601:603>|wi fi<601:606>|fi<604:606>|unit<624:628>|early<629:634>|fi<651:653>|finally<651:658>|talk<659:665>|replace<678:687>|function<695:703>|malfunction<692:706>|one<707:710>|heat<726:730>|function<731:739>|remove<742:749>|old<753:756>|2 gang<757:763>|gang<759:763>|gang box<759:767>|box<764:767>|put<772:775>|gang<783:787>|3 gang<781:787>|gang box<783:791>|3 gang box<781:791>|box<788:791>|allow<795:800>|cool<810:817>|space<818:823>|set<824:827>|new<835:838>|unit<839:843>|remove<848:855>|old<860:863>|reinstall<880:889>|reinstall<880:891>|wi<910:912>|kasa<915:919>|kasa app<915:923>|speak<925:930>|echo<937:941>|turn<945:949>|overhead<954:962>|old<973:976>|overhead<983:991>|support<1002:1009>|turn<1026:1030>|voice<1041:1046>|change<1079:1085>|change<1079:1086>|firmware<1104:1112>|unit<1122:1127>|old<1129:1132>|new<1137:1140>|act<1146:1152>|same<1157:1161>|alexa<1166:1171>|fail<1172:1177>|activate<1181:1189>|voice<1194:1199>|reply<1207:1212>|support<1223:1230>|function<1236:1244>|alexa<1260:1265>|phone<1266:1271>|one<1268:1271>|manually<1279:1287>|turn<1288:1292>|turn<1298:1302>|dim<1309:1312>|one<1313:1316>|user<1317:1321>|suggest<1322:1331>|fi<1336:1338>|fix<1336:1339>|wi<1346:1348>|reinstall<1363:1372>|care<1383:1387>|fi<1391:1393>|fix<1391:1394>|flaw<1403:1407>|reset<1421:1426>|device<1434:1441>|start<1445:1450>|add<1467:1470>|new<1473:1476>|echo<1477:1481>|unit<1482:1486>|kasa<1490:1494>|device<1495:1501>|wi<1519:1521>|add<1527:1530>|add<1527:1533>|kasa<1548:1552>|device<1553:1559>|device<1553:1560>|simply<1561:1567>|put<1568:1571>|compatible<1583:1593>|require<1606:1613>|extra<1623:1628>|promise<1656:1663>|keep<1667:1671>|working<1675:1682>|send<1690:1697>|back<1703:1707>",

One lamp is connected to the wired plug and the rest are connected to Leviton smart plugs. I use Android and Google Home.Pros:- Decent look- Easy installation- Easy configuration in Leviton appCons:- Buttons feel a bit flimsy when pressing them- Horrible latency (sometimes multiple seconds before light responds to switch)Switch has a simple, modern look and installation is easy, provided you have a neutral wire and enough room in the switch box (it can be a tight fit). The switch was easy to connect to Wi-Fi and configure with the Leviton app. The bottom button controls the wired light switch and the remaining buttons can be programmed to control other devices. There are a decent number of options, but I just have each button programmed to \"toggle one device\", which are the Leviton smart plugs used for my lamps. While you can program a button to set multiple devices to a particular state, there is no option to toggle multiple devices on or off with the same button. However, this is something that can be achieved by creating automations through other services. For example, I set up a routine in Google Home to keep one light switch in sync with another, so when one goes on or off, the other does as well.Not surprisingly, since this is a Wi-Fi switch, the biggest problem is latency. When I push a button, I assume the signal has to go out through the internet to Leviton servers and back to turn on my Wi-Fi smart plug. Most of the time, this takes around 1 to 2 seconds, which is just enough time to be annoying. Sometimes, when the connection is bad, nothing will happen at all when you push a button, and if you keep pressing it, the commands can queue up, leading to a bunch of light flickering when they finally make it through.I assume there is not really a solution to the latency problem until this device can be updated with Matter support. I contacted Leviton, and they said Matter support is planned, but there is no timeline. It's a shame, because the latency problem is really the only thing keeping this from being a 5-star device for me. In the meantime, waiting a few seconds for the lights to turn on is still better than having to walk across to room to turn them on at the source. Maybe people using Apple HomeKit will have a better experience.###high<3:7>|latency<8:15>|miss<20:27>|matter<28:34>|matter support<28:42>|support<35:42>|replace<49:57>|regular<60:67>|a regular switch<58:74>|one<85:88>|control<99:106>|multiple<107:115>|lamp<116:120>|lamp<116:121>|instead<122:129>|one<138:141>|one<144:147>|lamp<148:152>|connect<156:163>|connect<156:165>|wire<173:177>|wired<173:178>|plug<179:183>|rest<192:196>|the rest<188:196>|connect<201:208>|connect<201:210>|leviton<214:221>|smart<222:227>|plug<228:232>|smart plug<222:232>|smart plug<222:233>|leviton smart plug<214:233>|plug<228:233>|android<241:248>|google<253:259>|home<260:264>|google home<253:264>|decent<272:278>|easy<285:289>|all<294:297>|installation<290:302>|easy<304:308>|configuration<309:322>|leviton<326:333>|leviton app<326:337>|feel<352:356>|flimsy<363:369>|press<375:383>|latency<399:406>|sometimes<408:417>|multiple<418:426>|second<427:434>|respond<448:456>|simple<480:486>|modern<488:494>|modern look<488:499>|all<508:511>|installation<504:516>|easy<520:524>|provide<526:534>|neutral<546:553>|a neutral wire<544:558>|wire<554:558>|neutral wire<546:558>|room<570:574>|box<589:592>|tight<606:611>|fit<612:615>|a tight fit<604:615>|tight fit<606:615>|easy<633:637>|connect<641:648>|wi<652:654>|fi<655:657>|wi fi<652:657>|configure<662:671>|leviton<681:688>|the leviton app<677:692>|leviton app<681:692>|bottom<698:704>|button<705:711>|control<712:719>|control<712:720>|wire<725:729>|wired<725:730>|remain<752:761>|button<762:768>|button<762:769>|program<777:784>|program<777:787>|control<791:798>|device<805:811>|device<805:812>|decent<826:832>|number<833:839>|option<843:849>|option<843:850>|button<873:879>|program<880:887>|program<880:890>|toggle<895:901>|one<902:905>|device<906:912>|leviton<929:936>|smart<937:942>|smart plug<937:947>|plug<943:947>|smart plug<937:948>|plug<943:948>|leviton smart plug<929:948>|lamp<961:965>|lamp<961:966>|program<982:989>|button<992:998>|set<1002:1005>|multiple<1006:1014>|device<1015:1021>|device<1015:1022>|particular<1028:1038>|state<1039:1044>|option<1058:1064>|toggle<1068:1074>|multiple<1075:1083>|device<1084:1090>|device<1084:1091>|same<1111:1115>|button<1116:1122>|however<1124:1131>|create<1175:1183>|automation<1184:1195>|service<1210:1218>|example<1224:1231>|set<1235:1238>|routine<1244:1251>|google<1255:1261>|home<1262:1266>|google home<1255:1266>|keep<1270:1274>|one<1275:1278>|sync<1295:1299>|one<1322:1325>|wi<1399:1401>|a wi fi<1397:1404>|fi<1402:1404>|wi fi<1399:1404>|wi fi switch<1399:1411>|big<1417:1424>|problem<1425:1432>|latency<1436:1443>|push<1452:1456>|button<1459:1465>|assume<1469:1475>|signal<1480:1486>|internet<1513:1521>|leviton<1525:1532>|server<1533:1540>|back<1545:1549>|turn<1553:1557>|wi<1564:1566>|fi<1567:1569>|wi fi<1564:1569>|smart<1570:1575>|smart plug<1570:1580>|plug<1576:1580>|most<1582:1586>|second<1625:1632>|2 second<1623:1632>|annoying<1666:1674>|sometimes<1676:1685>|connect<1696:1703>|connection<1696:1706>|happen<1728:1734>|all<1738:1741>|push<1751:1755>|button<1758:1764>|keep<1777:1781>|press<1782:1790>|command<1799:1807>|queue<1812:1817>|lead<1822:1829>|a bunch<1833:1840>|bunch<1835:1840>|flickering<1850:1860>|light flickering<1844:1860>|all<1874:1877>|finally<1871:1878>|assume<1897:1903>|all<1919:1922>|solution<1926:1934>|latency<1942:1949>|problem<1950:1957>|device<1969:1975>|update<1983:1990>|matter<1996:2002>|matter support<1996:2010>|support<2003:2010>|contact<2014:2023>|leviton<2024:2031>|matter<2047:2053>|matter support<2047:2061>|support<2054:2061>|plan<2065:2072>|shame<2107:2112>|a shame<2105:2112>|latency<2126:2133>|problem<2134:2141>|all<2147:2150>|keep<2167:2171>|keep<2167:2174>|5 star<2193:2199>|device<2200:2206>|wait<2232:2239>|second<2246:2253>|few second<2242:2253>|a few second<2240:2253>|turn<2272:2276>|still<2283:2288>|walk<2311:2315>|across<2316:2322>|room<2326:2330>|turn<2334:2338>|source<2354:2360>|people<2368:2374>|apple<2381:2386>|home<2387:2391>|apple homekit<2381:2394>|homekit<2387:2394>|experience<2414:2424>",
      "Tight fit in switch box###tight<0:5>|fit<6:9>|tight fit<0:9>|box<20:23>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2023-09-23] <b>Installation relatively easy, beware of the DEEP switch! Need a Leviton switch plate cover.</b> Interesting installation:  Two of the wires (ground, neutral) are fastened to existing wires in the switch box with wire nuts.  But line and load wires need to be attached to the switch with screw terminals..Since my old switch had the wires attached to the switch with push-wire installation, I had to remove the wires from the old switch, then bend the wires into a little “C” shape to install them onto the TP Link’s screw terminals, then fasten those down.  This made the installation a bit more tedious, but it does save a bit of room in the switch box (as the wire nuts can be bulky and take up a bit of room).After some effort was able to fit the switch into the switch box, but it was quite a tight fit. This is a thick switch.  Screwed it in (it’s in a 2-gang switch box with another decora/decorator-type switch that controls the bathroom fan) and tried to put on the Legrand 2-gang decorator switch plate, but the bottom of the plate would not cover the TP Links switch fully.  There was a little annoying gap at the bottom, even with the switch plate fully fastened.I bought another 2-gang switch plate (by Leviton) and this was a midway switch which was a bit deeper.. thankfully this fit perfectly!  So keep that in mind.. if you don’t use the included switch plate cover by TP Link, you’ll need a deeper, thicker switch plate cover to accommodate this thick switch.  Leviton’s midway plate worked well for this.Now that the switch is installed it works great.  Installed via the TP Link Kasa app, connected to Alexa and added to Home Assistant.  The dimmer functionality works well and the switch looks nice.  I am not sure how I like the switch feel when using the switch manually, though. It feels a little odd (not like a “real” click from a mechanical switch).  Most of the time I use sensors and timers to turn the switch on/off, so not a big deal, but the physical switch itself doesn’t feel 100% like a real manual/mechanical switch.Overall I like it.  It’s a great value for the price (less than $20) and it is UL listed, which was an important requirement for me.###installation<3:15>|relatively<16:26>|easy<27:31>|beware<33:39>|deep<47:51>|leviton<67:74>|plate<82:87>|plate cover<82:93>|cover<88:93>|install<111:118>|installation<111:123>|wire<137:141>|wire<137:142>|ground<144:150>|neutral<152:159>|exist<177:185>|wire<186:190>|wire<186:191>|box<206:209>|wire<215:219>|wire nut<215:224>|nut<220:224>|line<231:235>|load<240:244>|wire<245:249>|wire<245:250>|load wire<240:250>|attach<262:270>|screw<290:295>|screw terminal<290:305>|terminal<296:305>|old<316:319>|wire<335:339>|wire<335:340>|attach<341:349>|push<369:373>|wire<374:378>|install<379:386>|installation<379:391>|remove<402:408>|wire<413:417>|wire<413:418>|old<428:431>|wire<454:458>|wire<454:459>|install<487:494>|tp<509:511>|tp link<509:516>|the tp link<505:516>|link<512:516>|screw<519:524>|screw terminal<519:534>|terminal<525:534>|install<575:582>|installation<575:587>|save<620:624>|room<634:638>|box<653:656>|wire<665:669>|wire nut<665:674>|nut<670:674>|bulky<682:687>|room<709:713>|effort<726:732>|able<737:741>|fit<745:748>|box<776:779>|tight<800:805>|a tight fit<798:809>|tight fit<800:809>|fit<806:809>|thick<821:826>|screw<836:843>|gang<863:867>|2 gang<861:867>|box<875:878>|gang switch box<863:878>|decora<892:898>|decora<899:905>|type<909:913>|control<926:934>|bathroom<939:947>|room<943:947>|fan<948:951>|bathroom fan<939:951>|put<966:969>|2 gang<985:991>|gang<987:991>|decora<992:998>|plate<1009:1014>|bottom<1024:1030>|plate<1038:1043>|cover<1054:1059>|tp<1064:1066>|link<1067:1071>|the tp link<1060:1071>|tp link<1064:1071>|the tp link<1060:1072>|link<1067:1072>|tp link<1064:1072>|fully<1080:1085>|annoying<1107:1115>|gap<1116:1119>|bottom<1127:1133>|plate<1156:1161>|fully<1162:1167>|gang<1196:1200>|2 gang<1194:1200>|plate<1208:1213>|leviton<1218:1225>|deep<1272:1278>|fully<1286:1291>|thankfully<1281:1291>|fit<1297:1300>|perfectly<1301:1310>|keep<1316:1320>|mind<1329:1333>|include<1357:1365>|plate<1373:1378>|cover<1379:1384>|plate cover<1373:1384>|tp<1388:1390>|link<1391:1395>|tp link<1388:1395>|deep<1411:1417>|thick<1419:1424>|thick<1419:1426>|plate<1434:1439>|cover<1440:1445>|plate cover<1434:1445>|thick<1466:1471>|leviton<1481:1488>|plate<1498:1503>|now<1525:1528>|install<1548:1555>|instal<1548:1557>|instal<1575:1584>|tp<1593:1595>|link<1596:1600>|the tp link<1589:1600>|tp link<1593:1600>|kasa<1601:1605>|link kasa<1596:1605>|tp link kasa<1593:1605>|kasa app<1601:1609>|connect<1611:1620>|alexa<1624:1629>|add<1634:1639>|home<1643:1647>|home assistant<1643:1657>|assistant<1648:1657>|dimmer<1664:1670>|functionality<1671:1684>|feel<1760:1764>|manual<1787:1793>|manually<1787:1795>|though<1797:1803>|feel<1808:1812>|feel<1808:1813>|odd<1823:1826>|real<1840:1844>|click<1846:1851>|mechanical<1859:1869>|most<1880:1884>|sensor<1903:1910>|timer<1915:1921>|turn<1925:1929>|big<1958:1961>|big deal<1958:1966>|deal<1962:1966>|a big deal<1956:1966>|physical<1976:1984>|physical switch<1976:1991>|feel<2007:2011>|real<2024:2028>|manual<2029:2035>|mechanical<2036:2046>|overall<2054:2061>|great value<2081:2092>|value<2087:2092>|price<2101:2106>|less<2108:2112>|ul<2133:2135>|list<2136:2142>|important<2157:2166>|requirement<2167:2178>",

Installation was done by my contractor so I can’t gauge how easy it is for the average homeowner to do. He relayed to me that it was as easy as adding any dimmer switch with the only challenge being fitting everything in where there were two or more switches side by side. Aside from the tight fit in some of the switch boxes it was a snap and having them sync with the Kasa app wouldn’t have been easier because the app walks you through set up in seconds. Alexa automatically discovered every Kasa device from the plug controlling my outdoor string lights to the switches throughout the house. The Kasa switches have a sleek modern look and for my spouse who prefers a physical switch the small light on each switch is just enough to help you find the switch in the dark. The response time between a command to Alexa and the action taking place is immediate and so far there’s been no issue.  I’ve had them all installed now for a few weeks and couldn’t be happier.###remodel<31:41>|home<46:50>|decide<53:60>|convert<64:71>|home<87:91>|possible<95:103>|smart<107:112>|technology<113:123>|hand<128:132>|hand<136:140>|alexa<146:151>|kasa<159:163>|plug<164:168>|plug<164:169>|kasa<171:175>|dimmer<176:182>|dimmer switches<176:191>|switches<183:191>|kasa<196:200>|three<201:206>|three way<201:210>|dimmer<211:217>|dimmer switches<211:226>|switches<218:226>|add<227:232>|entire<246:252>|front<265:270>|back<281:285>|control<296:306>|kasa<314:318>|the kasa app<310:322>|kasa app<314:322>|prefer<331:337>|alexa<339:344>|installation<346:358>|contractor<374:384>|easy<406:410>|average<425:432>|home<433:437>|relay<453:460>|easy<482:486>|add<490:496>|dimmer<501:507>|challenge<529:538>|fit<545:548>|fit<545:552>|side<605:609>|side<613:617>|side by side<605:617>|side<620:624>|tight<634:639>|fit<640:643>|tight fit<634:643>|box<666:671>|snap<681:685>|sync<702:706>|kasa<716:720>|kasa app<716:724>|the kasa app<712:724>|easy<744:750>|walk<767:772>|set<785:788>|second<795:802>|alexa<804:809>|automatically<810:823>|discover<824:834>|kasa<841:845>|device<846:852>|plug<862:866>|control<867:878>|outdoor<882:889>|string<890:896>|string light<890:903>|house<935:940>|kasa<946:950>|sleek<967:972>|modern<973:979>|modern look<973:984>|prefer<1007:1013>|prefer<1007:1014>|physical<1017:1025>|physical switch<1017:1032>|small<1037:1042>|help<1082:1086>|find<1091:1095>|dark<1114:1118>|response<1124:1132>|response time<1124:1137>|command<1148:1155>|alexa<1159:1164>|action<1173:1179>|place<1187:1192>|far<1213:1216>|issue<1233:1238>|no issue<1230:1238>|instal<1259:1268>|now<1269:1272>|few week<1279:1288>|a few week<1277:1288>|week<1283:1288>|happy<1305:1312>",

It has worked perfectly from day one and provided 10 levels of dimming capability controlled through the house's Alexa.  The switch's touch pad worked well, although the dimmer setting switches were rather small (only complaint).Installation is TIGHT and this unit barely fits into a double switch box having a regular switch on the left. It would be exceedingly difficult installing two of these side by side, but it appears to be possible.April 2022....... It died. Although it's \"I'm on/off\" lights and dimmer level setting lights were operative, there was no outgoing current at any setting.

      "Takes up more space in workbox###space<14:19>|more space<9:19>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★☆☆ [2021-04-27] <b>Bring Back The Screw Terminals</b> The 2nd Gen switches/dimmers now have 5 lead wires hanging from the box instead of screw terminals. This made the installation of a switch and dimmer today much longer to do. Last week, I had to do a 3-gang box (all 1st Gen switches) because one of them failed. Replacing it with a new 2nd Gen switch was a pain in-the-you-know-what. Had to redo the whole box because of the different wiring. If there were screw terminals, most of the time it's simply backing off the old switch/dimmer (dumb or smart) and \"dropping in\" the new (with the exception on the neutral wires).Though the 2nd Gen switches/dimmers are a bit shallower, having to now use wire nuts and addition of lead wires adds EXTRA stuff being pushed in the workbox. You are NOT saving on space. I ended up cutting back several lead wires to save on space.I haven't had enough time to comment about performance but I did notice that these connected to Wi-Fi extremely fast vs the 1st Gen switches/dimmers that I have - within seconds(!!) of the power being turned back on after installation.###bring<3:8>|back<9:13>|screw<18:23>|2nd<42:45>|2nd gen<42:49>|the 2nd gen<38:49>|gen<46:49>|2nd gen switch<42:56>|2nd gen switch<42:58>|dimmer<59:65>|dimmer<59:66>|now<67:70>|lead<78:82>|wire<83:87>|wire<83:88>|hang<89:96>|box<106:109>|instead<110:117>|screw<121:126>|screw terminal<121:136>|terminal<127:136>|installation<152:164>|dimmer<181:187>|today<188:193>|long<199:205>|last<213:217>|week<218:222>|3 gang<238:244>|gang<240:244>|3 gang box<238:248>|gang box<240:248>|box<245:248>|1st<254:257>|gen<258:261>|1st gen<254:261>|1st gen switch<254:270>|fail<292:298>|replace<300:309>|new<320:323>|2nd<324:327>|gen<328:331>|2nd gen<324:331>|2nd gen switch<324:338>|pain<345:349>|a pain<343:349>|now<362:365>|whole<388:393>|box<394:397>|different<413:422>|wiring<423:429>|screw<445:450>|terminal<451:460>|screw terminal<445:460>|most<462:466>|simply<484:490>|back<491:495>|back<491:498>|old<507:510>|dimmer<518:524>|dumb<526:530>|smart<534:539>|drop<546:554>|new<563:566>|exception<577:586>|neutral<594:601>|wire<602:606>|wire<602:607>|2nd<620:623>|the 2nd gen<616:627>|2nd gen<620:627>|gen<624:627>|2nd gen switch<620:634>|2nd gen switch<620:636>|dimmer<637:643>|dimmer<637:644>|now<676:679>|wire<684:688>|nut<689:693>|wire nut<684:693>|addition<698:706>|lead<710:714>|wire<715:719>|wire<715:720>|add<721:725>|extra<726:731>|push<744:750>|box<762:765>|save<779:785>|space<789:794>|end<798:803>|cut<807:814>|back<815:819>|lead<828:832>|wire<833:837>|wire<833:838>|save<842:846>|space<850:855>|comment<885:892>|performance<899:910>|notice<921:927>|connect<939:948>|wi<952:954>|fi<955:957>|wi fi<952:957>|extremely<958:967>|fast<968:972>|1st<980:983>|1st gen<980:987>|gen<984:987>|1st gen switch<980:996>|dimmer<997:1003>|dimmer<997:1004>|second<1026:1033>|power<1045:1050>|turn<1057:1063>|back<1064:1068>|installation<1078:1090>",

Overall, install was about what you'd expect, however I do have a few comments and things you might want to consider:1) The back of these things are HUGE. I have a house built in 1980 with standard flip switches. On top of that, most of my light switches were in 3 gang boxes, making it already crowded. Installing these was a huge pain, as I had to shift wires around relentlessly, cut/strip/rewire to find ways to make these things fit. Each install took a good hour or two to get things in place.2) Although it worked in multiple gang outlets, these are clearly intended for a single switch, given their thickness of the external plate (which the cover attaches directly to).3) These connect directly to wifi through 2.4ghz. While this may sound like a good thing, once you add a dozen of these to your home, you will find your network is quickly bogged down with all the signals/interference. This created intermittent wifi problems for me, of which now I will probably have to get a better router to handle the new traffic. I imagine a z-wave + hub alternative would have solved this since they would all be routed through a single hub signal, not 10+ individual connects.Overall, they look good, the app is great, the Google home integrations are endless, and I'm planning to keep these as part of the house. But in the future I would prefer to see a slimmer option with a hub instead for a serious install or whole-home solution.###replace<3:11>|ever<12:16>|home<31:35>|replace<73:80>|all<86:89>|ever<91:95>|home<109:113>|include<115:124>|3 way<131:136>|3 way switch<131:145>|non<151:154>|dimmer<155:161>|non dimmer switch<151:170>|overall<172:179>|all<176:179>|install<181:188>|all<185:188>|ever<221:225>|however<218:225>|comment<242:250>|back<296:300>|huge<321:325>|house<336:341>|build<342:347>|standard<361:369>|flip<370:374>|top<388:391>|most<401:405>|gang<437:441>|3 gang<435:441>|3 gang box<435:447>|box<442:447>|gang box<437:447>|already<459:466>|all<480:483>|instal<476:486>|huge<499:503>|pain<504:508>|wire<528:533>|cut<555:558>|strip<559:564>|rewire<565:571>|find<575:579>|fit<606:609>|install<616:623>|all<620:623>|hour<636:640>|multiple<696:704>|gang<705:709>|outlet<710:717>|clearly<729:736>|intend<737:745>|single<752:758>|give<767:772>|thickness<779:788>|external<796:804>|plate<805:810>|cover<822:827>|attach<828:836>|directly<837:845>|connect<859:866>|directly<867:875>|wifi<879:883>|sound<915:920>|add<949:952>|a dozen<953:960>|dozen<955:960>|home<978:982>|find<993:997>|network<1003:1010>|quickly<1014:1021>|all<1039:1042>|signal<1047:1053>|signal<1047:1054>|interference<1055:1067>|create<1074:1081>|intermittent<1082:1094>|wifi<1095:1099>|problem<1100:1108>|now<1126:1129>|probably<1137:1145>|router<1167:1173>|handle<1177:1183>|new<1188:1191>|imagine<1203:1210>|wave<1215:1219>|z wave<1213:1219>|hub<1222:1225>|alternative<1226:1237>|solve<1249:1255>|all<1278:1281>|single<1302:1308>|hub<1309:1312>|signal<1313:1319>|individual<1329:1339>|connect<1340:1347>|connect<1340:1348>|all<1353:1356>|overall<1349:1356>|google<1396:1402>|home<1403:1407>|google home<1396:1407>|the google home<1392:1407>|integration<1408:1420>|home integration<1403:1420>|google home integration<1396:1420>|plan<1442:1450>|keep<1454:1458>|part<1468:1472>|house<1480:1485>|future<1498:1504>|prefer<1513:1519>|slim<1529:1536>|option<1537:1543>|hub<1551:1554>|instead<1555:1562>|all<1581:1584>|install<1577:1584>|whole<1588:1593>|home<1594:1598>|solution<1599:1607>",

They are easy to control, have a nice solid feel when you press them, and I really like the glow they emit when off so you can find them in the dark. My only complaint is that these dimmers were very hard to fit into the electrical box when I installed them. They were standard ganged metal boxes (3 ganged together) and the contour of them interlocking parts interfered with the switch housing. I eventually made it work by swapping the 2 dimmers around with the 1 single pole I was putting in, but it was a major headache. Would be nice if Kasa gave a little more wiggle room on the housing. Even swapping boxes out wouldn't have helped since the issue was height and not depth. But now they're in and I'm very happy.###tight<16:21>|a tight fit<14:25>|tight fit<16:25>|fit<22:25>|box<33:36>|kasa<55:59>|dimmer<75:81>|these dimmer switch<69:90>|exception<98:107>|easy<118:122>|control<126:133>|solid<147:152>|feel<153:157>|press<167:172>|glow<201:205>|find<236:240>|dark<253:257>|complaint<267:276>|only complaint<262:276>|dimmer<291:297>|dimmer<291:298>|hard<309:313>|fit<317:320>|electrical<330:340>|box<341:344>|electrical box<330:344>|the electrical box<326:344>|instal<352:361>|standard<378:386>|gang<387:393>|metal<394:399>|box<400:403>|metal box<394:405>|box<400:405>|gang<409:415>|together<416:424>|part<463:468>|interfere<469:479>|housing<496:503>|eventually<507:517>|swap<534:542>|dimmer<549:555>|dimmer<549:556>|single<575:581>|single pole<575:586>|pole<582:586>|put<593:600>|major<618:623>|headache<624:632>|kasa<651:655>|give<656:660>|room<682:686>|housing<694:701>|swap<708:716>|box<717:720>|box<717:722>|help<741:747>|issue<758:763>|depth<783:788>|now<794:797>|happy<822:827>",

      "Difficult to install in older homes###difficult<0:9>|install<13:20>|old<24:29>|home<30:35>|old home<24:35>|||B079775ZZQ ★★☆☆☆ [2020-06-28] <b>A Problematic Experience, With a Surprising Twist !</b> We purchased two Kasa HS220 dimmers, to add to the home automation devices we already use.  We are heavily invested in the Alexa platform, with Echo devices, smart plugs and Echo buttons in every room of our home, from Amazon, Meross and now TP-Link.  We care for a disabled parent at home, and Alexa has been a godsend, helping us to care for them, communicate with them even when outside the home, and giving them an easy way to notify us they need help (by pressing Echo buttons that are tied to Alexa routines we've written).The first Kasa dimmer we installed replaces an old rheostat type dimmer, controlling a ceiling fixture with ten 3.3 watt dimmable LED candleabra bulbs, for a total load of 33 watts.  These bulbs, as well as the 40-watt incandescent bulbs they replaced a year or two ago (10 x 40 watts = 400 watts), worked flawlessly on the old (dumb) dimmer.The Kasa app installed without any issues on our Android phone.  It does not appear that TP-Link offers the Kasa app for Fire tablets in Amazon's app store, which is disappointing, especially since they advertise that their devices work with Alexa.The physical installation of the dimmer into a single-gang wall box ran into problems.  The switch is so large that you have to shoehorn it into the box, which proved impossible in our case, because all the boxes in our (circa 1960) home have ground wires fastened to the outside of the boxes with screws that protrude slightly into the interior of the boxes, which is just enough to prevent installing the Kasa dimmer.  The only solution is to either try to file down the screw, or break open the wall to get access to the outside of the electrical box.The Kasa dimmer only dims the dimmable LED bulbs to around 80% of full brightness, even after trying to adjust it using the dimmer calibration feature in the Kasa app.  That's just barely enough to notice amy dimming, and is just not sufficient.  We decided to replace just one of the ten LED bulbs with an incandescent bulb, to see if that bulb dimmed any more successfully than the other eleven.  That's when we got a big surprise.  With just one of the ten bulbs being an incandescent, ALL of the bulbs dim beautifully.  No flickering, and going from almost off to full brightness smoothly and reliably, and back down to off just as smoothly.  This indicates that the LED bulbs are not the issue.  It also invalidates a comment from TP-Link support that another Amazonian's review mentioned, that only a single-bulb fixture can be successfully dimmed with the Kasa HS220 dimmer.  That is clearly not the case.So what is going on here?  Our best guess is that either the dimmer does not work correctly with low-wattage loads, or more likely, the dimmer can't handle the type of load that some dimmable LEDs present to it.  A less likely answer is that this particular dimmer is defective, which we can check by replacing it with the second HS220 we bought.Based on the dismal experiences with TP-Link support that others have posted here, I probably won't waste my time going that route, opting to just return the dimmers within Amazon's return period.  Of course, I could just mix LED and incandescent bulbs to make the HS220 happy, but since just one incandescent bulb draws more than 10 LED bulbs, that doesn't make any sense, and isn't a very elegant solution.One last thing about this TP-Link product...  The box says \"DESIGNED IN CALIFORNIA,  MADE IN VIETNAM\".  I am not impressed.  Was I supposed to be?We will update this review, if warranted.Update # 1 -  There were a few instances in the last day where the LED bulbs were getting dimmed perfectly, but the behavior didn't last.  Now, it's back to only slightly dimming the bulbs.  We've also had a few instances where all bulbs were flickering.  Maybe it's a defective dimmer after all ???###problematic<5:16>|experience<17:27>|twist<47:52>|kasa<76:80>|dim<87:90>|dimmer<87:93>|dimmer<87:94>|add<99:102>|home<110:114>|automation<115:125>|home

I'd tried to read up about it and since my house isn't super new, I wasn't sure if what I had would work. But I shouldn't have worried.Does the wiring to your switch from your breaker box have a black, white, and ground wire (ground is either bare copper or green)? Congrats, you have a neutral wire and all these types of things will Just Work™.I don't know why people make it out like it's an unusual or \"new\" feature of wiring. You'd need REALLY old wiring not to have two wires going into your light switch.  Maybe if you have knob and tube wiring from the early 1900s...Anyway... the setup was really easy... pro tip, there's a QR Code on the inside of the switch itself that the app wants you to scan.... scan that before you install the switch!  You can still set it up via the Kasa app even without the QR code, but you need the code to do it from inside Google/Amazon/Alexa.It installed easily and obviously. It fits in a standard light switch box (though it fills a lot of the space, so you can't have a whole ton of wires hanging around behind it).  It dims my LED lights, and even turns on/off with a nice quick fade in/out.  Very happy with it.###wiring<33:39>|worry<47:52>|neutral<70:77>|neutral wire<70:82>|a neutral wire<67:82>|wire<78:82>|worry<94:101>|neutral<118:125>|a neutral wire<116:130>|neutral wire<118:130>|wire<126:130>|read<145:149>|house<175:180>|super<187:192>|new<193:196>|worry<259:266>|wiring<276:282>|breaker<308:315>|box<316:319>|black<327:332>|white<334:339>|ground<345:351>|wire<352:356>|ground wire<345:356>|ground<358:364>|copper<380:386>|green<390:395>|neutral<419:426>|a neutral wire<417:431>|wire<427:431>|neutral wire<419:431>|type<446:451>|people<495:501>|new<539:542>|feature<544:551>|wiring<555:561>|old<581:584>|wiring<585:591>|wire<608:612>|wire<608:613>|wiring<677:683>|early<693:698>|anyway<707:713>|set<721:724>|setup<721:726>|easy<738:742>|pro<746:749>|tip<750:753>|qr<765:767>|qr code<765:772>|code<768:772>|a qr code<763:772>|scan<834:838>|scan<843:847>|install<864:871>|still<893:898>|set<899:902>|kasa<917:921>|kasa app<917:925>|the kasa app<913:925>|qr<943:945>|the qr code<939:950>|qr code<943:950>|code<946:950>|code<969:973>|google<995:1001>|amazon alexa<1002:1014>|alexa<1009:1014>|install<1018:1025>|instal<1018:1027>|easily<1028:1034>|obviously<1039:1048>|fit<1053:1057>|standard<1063:1071>|standard light switch<1063:1084>|box<1085:1088>|fill<1100:1105>|space<1119:1124>|whole<1146:1151>|ton<1152:1155>|wire<1159:1163>|wire<1159:1164>|hang<1165:1172>|dim<1196:1200>|led<1204:1207>|led light<1204:1214>|turn<1225:1230>|quick<1250:1255>|fade<1256:1260>|fade in out<1256:1267>|happy<1275:1280>",

The software integration has been great, only compliments there. In the 3 years since installation, three of the original switches failed and required replacement, all of which have been the 2nd generation models. The problem is that lack of screw terminals means that more room is required for wire nuts in the electrical box. This is all fine and dandy if you have nice clean wiring in your boxes, but I have some absolutely horrendous situations where I need every bit of space I can get. I am so frustrated by this that I think I will migrate away from Leviton switches as they keep failing and I install new ones.###lack<3:7>|screw<11:16>|screw terminal<11:26>|terminal<17:26>|all<32:35>|limit<37:45>|all<56:59>|install<52:59>|instal<52:61>|1st<71:74>|generation<75:85>|1st generation<71:85>|mostly<110:116>|experience<122:132>|software<138:146>|integration<147:158>|year<208:213>|3 year<206:213>|all<224:227>|install<220:227>|installation<220:232>|original<247:255>|fail<265:271>|require<276:284>|replacement<285:296>|all<298:301>|2nd<325:328>|generation<329:339>|the 2nd generation<321:339>|2nd generation<325:339>|generation model<329:346>|model<340:346>|problem<352:359>|lack<368:372>|screw<376:381>|screw terminal<376:391>|terminal<382:391>|mean<392:397>|room<408:412>|require<416:424>|wire<429:433>|nut<434:438>|wire nut<429:438>|electrical<446:456>|box<457:460>|electrical box<446:460>|the electrical box<442:460>|all<470:473>|clean<506:511>|wiring<512:518>|box<527:530>|box<527:532>|absolutely<550:560>|situation<572:582>|space<609:614>|away<681:685>|leviton<691:698>|keep<716:720>|fail<721:728>|install<735:742>|all<739:742>|new<743:746>|one<747:751>|new one<743:751>",

This was my second installation of this switch, but the first 3-way circuit.  You need to identify the hot wire in your box, and you need a neutral wire.  If you're comfortable with wiring, the installation is pretty straight forward (but a tight fit.) If you're creating a 3-way circuit, you must also wire a smart companion switch into the other box.  The wiring of the companion switch is very different from a mechanical switch, so read the wiring diagram carefully.  You need to be able to identify the red vs. red/yellow companion wires in the other box in order to wire the companion switch correctly.  Sort all the wiring out in both boxes before replacing the switches.  Once the switch is installed and powered up, you need to pair the switch to the \"My Leviton\" app.  Pairing is straight-forward, and there are lots of neat features you can use from the app when the switch is connected.  Siri/ Homekit integration is less easy.  The switch will not pair with Apple Home when first energized.  You need to download firmware updates first. Go to System Settings on the Leviton app and follow the update prompts.  It takes about 20 minutes to download the firmware updates.  Once installed, you will get a notice about updating to the Matter protocol. Say yes, and accept the update.  You then need to find the \"Matter Pairing Code\", which is under Device Settings for the switch.  Open the Home app on your phone and use the pairing code or QR-code to add the device to Apple Home.  This is NOT the same QR code that comes with the packaging. You can use Siri to control the switch once it has been added to Home.###apple<14:19>|home<20:24>|apple home<14:24>|siri<26:30>|instal<48:57>|smart<63:68>|replace<79:86>|mechanical<89:99>|3 way<100:105>|3 way switch<100:112>|second<127:133>|installation<134:146>|first<171:176>|3 way<177:182>|circuit<183:190>|identify<205:213>|hot<218:221>|hot wire<218:226>|wire<222:226>|box<235:238>|neutral<255:262>|neutral wire<255:267>|wire<263:267>|a neutral wire<253:267>|comfortable<280:291>|able<287:291>|wiring<297:303>|installation<309:321>|pretty<325:331>|straight<332:340>|forward<341:348>|tight<356:361>|tight fit<356:365>|a tight fit<354:365>|fit<362:365>|create<378:386>|3 way<389:394>|circuit<395:402>|wire<418:422>|smart<425:430>|companion<431:440>|box<463:466>|wiring<473:479>|companion<487:496>|different<512:521>|mechanical<529:539>|read<551:555>|wiring<560:566>|diagram<567:574>|carefully<575:584>|able<602:606>|identify<610:618>|red<623:626>|red<631:634>|companion<642:651>|wire<652:656>|wire<652:657>|box<671:674>|wire<687:691>|companion<696:705>|correctly<713:722>|sort<725:729>|wiring<738:744>|box<757:760>|box<757:762>|replace<770:779>|once<795:799>|instal<814:823>|red<832:835>|power<828:835>|pair<852:856>|leviton<879:886>|leviton app<879:891>|pairing<894:901>|straight<905:913>|forward<914:921>|neat<945:949>|feature<950:958>|connect<1003:1012>|siri<1015:1019>|home<1021:1025>|homekit<1021:1028>|homekit integration<1021:1040>|integration<1029:1040>|less<1044:1048>|easy<1049:1053>|pair<1076:1080>|apple<1086:1091>|apple home<1086:1096>|home<1092:1096>|first<1102:1107>|download<1132:1140>|firmware<1141:1149>|update<1150:1156>|firmware update<1141:1157>|update<1150:1157>|first<1158:1163>|system<1171:1177>|settings<1178:1186>|leviton<1194:1201>|leviton app<1194:1205>|the leviton app<1190:1205>|follow<1210:1216>|update<1221:1227>|prompt<1228:1235>|20 minute<1253:1263>|minute<1256:1263>|download<1267:1275>|firmware<1280:1288>|update<1289:1295>|update<1289:1296>|firmware update<1280:1296>|the firmware update<1276:1296>|once<1299:1303>|instal<1304:1313>|notice<1330:1336>|update<1343:1351>|matter<1359:1365>|matter protocol<1359:1374>|protocol<1366:1374>|accept<1389:1395>|update<1400:1406>|find<1426:1430>|matter<1436:1442>|pairing<1443:1450>|code<1451:1455>|device<1473:1479>|settings<1480:1488>|open<1506:1510>|home<1515:1519>|phone<1532:1537>|pair<1550:1554>|pair<1550:1557>|code<1558:1562>|qr<1566:1568>|code<1569:1573>|qr code<1566:1573>|add<1577:1580>|device<1585:1591>|apple<1595:1600>|apple home<1595:1605>|home<1601:1605>|same<1624:1628>|qr<1629:1631>|qr code<1629:1636>|code<1632:1636>|packaging<1657:1666>|siri<1680:1684>|control<1688:1695>|once<1707:1711>|add<1724:1727>|add<1724:1729>|home<1733:1737>"

I have 5 of their plugs and just bought 2 of the Smart Dimmer switches. This review is just for the switches.First the Pros:The switches are easy to install and by themselves are attractive and easy to use. They were easy to set up and operate through the Kasa app. However, the box did not have any instructions on how to physically install the switch. If you don't plan on integrating them with Alexa or Google then I would recommend the switch.Now the Cons:Based on the reviews, Kasa products appear to have a chronic issue with migrating to the Alexa app that Kasa TP-Link refuses to acknowledge. While the Alexa app will see the Kasa devices, you cannot operate them through the Alexa app or Echo Dot devices. You will receive a \"Server is Unresponsive\" message. But the worst part is dealing with the incompetent Tech Support. They are poorly trained and do not know their own product. They will have you delete the app and re-install it multiple times which I had done twice prior to calling them. Note that when you delete their app, you will then need to reinstall all of your devices again. This is a very time consuming task. I'll be sending mine back and I will look for another manufacturer.###last<20:24>|kasa<25:29>|kasa<56:60>|tp<61:63>|link<64:68>|kasa tp link<56:68>|tp link<61:68>|tp link product<61:77>|plug<97:102>|smart<128:133>|dimmer<134:140>|smart dimmer<128:140>|re<156:158>|first<188:193>|pro<198:202>|re<217:219>|easy<220:224>|install<228:235>|re<255:257>|attractive<258:268>|easy<273:277>|re<293:295>|easy<296:300>|set<304:307>|operate<315:322>|kasa<335:339>|the kasa app<331:343>|kasa app<335:343>|however<345:352>|box<358:361>|instruction<379:391>|physically<402:412>|install<413:420>|plan<446:450>|integrate<454:465>|alexa<476:481>|google<485:491>|re<505:507>|recommend<505:514>|now<526:529>|con<534:538>|base<539:544>|re<552:554>|kasa<561:565>|appear<575:581>|issue<600:605>|alexa<628:633>|kasa<643:647>|tp<648:650>|link<651:655>|tp link<648:655>|kasa tp link<643:655>|re<656:658>|refuse<656:663>|alexa<690:695>|kasa<713:717>|device<718:725>|operate<738:745>|alexa<763:768>|echo<776:780>|echo dot<776:784>|dot<781:784>|device<785:792>|re<803:805>|receive<803:810>|server<814:820>|re<826:828>|unresponsive<824:836>|message<838:845>|part<861:865>|deal<869:876>|tech<898:902>|support<903:910>|tech support<898:910>|re<918:920>|poorly<921:927>|own<958:961>|delete<990:996>|re<1009:1011>|install<1012:1019>|multiple<1023:1031>|multiple time<1023:1037>|twice<1055:1060>|prior<1061:1066>|call<1070:1077>|note<1084:1088>|delete<1103:1109>|re<1143:1145>|install<1145:1152>|reinstall<1143:1152>|device<1165:1172>|again<1173:1178>|consume<1200:1209>|task<1210:1214>|send<1224:1231>|back<1237:1241>|re<1279:1281>|manufacturer<1270:1282>",

It work so well I plan to do all my switches. Get yourself an electricity tester pen before you start and know your wire colors. Trust me you will need it for the three way version which is a little tricky to install.  Basic switch is easy if you have the white neutral wire which is required.  The only thing I absolutely do not like is how they don't sit well under a standard faceplate. It doesn't sit flat under the faceplate and leaves a gap around the edge.  If you only have one switch on the wall then the faceplate you get in the box will work fine but many of my switches have two or three switches side by side.  Kasa needs to make their switch lay flat against the wall so a standard cover will hide it better without that gap between the wall and the faceplate.###easy<3:7>|install<11:18>|set<20:23>|control<31:38>|alexa<44:49>|standard<79:87>|faceplate<88:97>|install<110:117>|instal<110:119>|kasa<125:129>|house<145:150>|no problem<178:189>|problem<181:189>|hook<224:228>|integrate<236:245>|alexa<256:261>|download<275:283>|kasa<288:292>|application<293:304>|follow<305:311>|prompt<316:323>|set<328:331>|alexa<379:384>|application<385:396>|find<401:405>|enable<410:416>|kasa<421:425>|skill<426:431>|alexa<438:443>|search<447:453>|new<458:461>|device<462:469>|find<482:486>|new<492:495>|plan<523:527>|electricity<567:578>|start<601:606>|wire<621:625>|color<626:632>|trust<634:639>|three way<668:677>|version<678:685>|tricky<704:710>|install<714:721>|basic<724:729>|easy<740:744>|white<761:766>|neutral<767:774>|neutral wire<767:779>|wire<775:779>|require<789:797>|absolutely<817:827>|sit<858:861>|standard<875:883>|faceplate<884:893>|sit<906:909>|flat<910:914>|faceplate<925:934>|leave<939:945>|gap<948:951>|a gap<946:951>|edge<963:967>|wall<1005:1009>|faceplate<1019:1028>|box<1044:1047>|side<1114:1118>|side<1122:1126>|side by side<1114:1126>|kasa<1129:1133>|lay<1161:1164>|flat<1165:1169>|wall<1182:1186>|standard<1192:1200>|cover<1201:1206>|hide<1212:1216>|gap<1240:1243>|wall<1256:1260>|faceplate<1269:1278>",

Had installed into a single gang deep box and had no problem at all.This new installation was to replace a simple Lutron slider switch that was in a 2 gang metal box; there was a GFI plug in the other spot.  I'd wired it all up with the wires and switch and plug outside the box . Once i had it all wired correctly,  I (1) noticed that ,in dimming the Kasa light, it only dimmed to about 50% of what the previous lutron switch had done. It was dimming 3 LED ceiling lights over bathroom sinks.  That was minimally acceptable, so I continued closing up box.  In trying to fit the Kasa switch into the box there was just no simple way to get it to fit. It wasn't the depth (although that was tight), it was the height -- just wouldn't fit into the metal box.  I read somewhere else in other reviews that someone was successful \"hammering\" the opening to open it up but it just wasn't worth it .  So i opted to return switch. I will either go back to previous lutron switch or try another brand of smart switch - FIRST verifying the dimensions of the switch.###issue<3:9>|level<15:20>|dim<24:31>|fit<37:40>|exist<47:55>|electrical<56:66>|box<67:70>|electrical box<56:70>|start<78:83>|smart<103:108>|software<138:146>|all<178:181>|instal<174:183>|single<191:197>|a single gang<189:202>|gang<198:202>|single gang<191:202>|deep<203:207>|box<208:211>|no problem<220:230>|problem<223:230>|all<234:237>|new<243:246>|all<251:254>|installation<247:259>|replace<267:274>|simple<277:283>|lutron<284:290>|slider<291:297>|gang<321:325>|2 gang<319:325>|metal<326:331>|box<332:335>|metal box<326:335>|plug<353:357>|spot<371:375>|wire<382:387>|all<391:394>|wire<407:412>|plug<428:432>|box<445:448>|all<465:468>|wire<469:474>|correctly<475:484>|notice<493:500>|dim<510:517>|kasa<522:526>|dim<542:548>|previous<574:582>|lutron<583:589>|dim<614:621>|led<624:627>|ceiling<628:635>|led ceiling<624:635>|led ceiling light<624:642>|ceiling light<628:642>|bathroom<648:656>|all<679:682>|acceptable<684:694>|continue<701:710>|close<711:718>|box<722:725>|fit<741:744>|kasa<749:753>|box<770:773>|simple<792:798>|fit<816:819>|depth<835:840>|tight<860:865>|fit<903:906>|metal<916:921>|box<922:925>|metal box<916:925>|read<930:934>|somewhere<935:944>|hammer<996:1005>|open<1011:1015>|open<1022:1026>|worth<1052:1057>|opt<1069:1074>|return<1078:1084>|back<1110:1114>|previous<1118:1126>|lutron<1127:1133>|brand<1156:1161>|another brand<1148:1161>|smart<1165:1170>|first<1180:1185>|verify<1186:1195>",

Many of the products I selected are from Kasa. About halfway through the conversion, I noticed some smart plugs or switches differed. The newer products are sleek and plug-and-play, while the older models are oversized, wired differently, and often don't connect to my smart network. Recently, I saw a big sale on dimmer switches, so I bought them. I have discovered three stages of this switch, and I have the oldest. They're so big, I can't fit them in the outlet box to hook them up. It's frustrating because I had the day set aside to install three of these and discovered the bait and switch by Kasa when I had the electrical disassembled. And shame on Amazon for putting the sale in my notifications, \"Hey Tony, we found something we think you'd like!\" You might be wrong, Bezos; I don't like it.###kasa<3:7>|market<24:30>|the market<20:30>|model<50:55>|convert<86:96>|entire<100:106>|house<107:112>|entire house<100:112>|smart<118:123>|a smart home<116:128>|home<124:128>|smart home<118:128>|select<153:161>|kasa<171:175>|notice<217:224>|smart<230:235>|plug<236:240>|plug<236:241>|smart plug<230:241>|new<268:273>|sleek<287:292>|plug<297:301>|play<306:310>|old<322:327>|model<328:333>|old model<322:334>|model<328:334>|oversized<339:348>|wire<350:355>|often<373:378>|connect<385:392>|smart<399:404>|network<405:412>|recently<414:422>|big<432:435>|sale<436:440>|dimmer<444:450>|discover<486:496>|old<541:547>|big<560:563>|fit<573:576>|outlet<589:595>|box<596:599>|outlet box<589:599>|hook<603:607>|frustrating<622:633>|day<652:655>|set<656:659>|install<669:676>|discover<696:706>|kasa<730:734>|electrical<750:760>|shame<779:784>|put<799:806>|sale<811:815>|notification<822:835>|hey<838:841>|find<851:856>",

So an already bulky switch that at least had side mounted wiring connections, now takes up even more space. Try fitting five wire nuts behind this switch in a standard single gang electrical box.

I had the pleasure of having self contained switches in my home, so I had to install old work j-boxes before installing, but once I got the boxes in, these fit with no issue, and we're very easy to install.I have 18 light switches in my home, 12 of them are now these switches. Even 2 of my 2 gang, and the 3 gang have these now, although they need separate face plates.The app is terrific, I got these to use in my Google home, which they do just perfectly, but I actually like the Kasa app more. They are very versatile as they connect with every smart home because of Matter.Lastly they look very sleek, and like they were meant to be there, but now with the added benefits of dimming these harsh LEDs and setting up some useful automations to make our day even easier!###easy<19:23>|install<27:34>|receive<44:53>|box<58:63>|package<74:82>|individual<99:109>|qr<128:130>|code<131:135>|qr code<128:135>|sticker<136:143>|lose<154:158>|install<170:177>|instal<170:180>|neutral<215:222>|line<223:227>|neutral line<215:227>|otherwise<229:238>|house<268:273>|build<278:283>|last<291:295>|year<302:307>|an issue<328:336>|issue<331:336>|self<367:371>|home<397:401>|install<415:422>|old<423:426>|box<434:439>|install<447:454>|instal<447:457>|once<463:467>|box<478:483>|fit<494:497>|no issue<503:511>|issue<506:511>|easy<528:532>|install<536:543>|home<575:579>|now<596:599>|2 gang<629:635>|gang<631:635>|3 gang<645:651>|gang<647:651>|now<663:666>|separate<687:695>|face<696:700>|plate<701:707>|face plate<696:707>|google<754:760>|google home<754:765>|home<761:765>|perfectly<786:795>|actually<803:811>|kasa<821:825>|the kasa app<817:829>|kasa app<821:829>|connect<868:875>|smart<887:892>|smart home<887:897>|home<893:897>|matter<909:915>|sleek<938:943>|mean<964:969>|now<987:990>|add<1000:1005>|fit<1010:1013>|benefit<1006:1014>|dim<1018:1025>|led<1038:1042>|set<1047:1054>|useful<1063:1069>|automation<1070:1081>|day<1094:1097>|easy<1103:1109>",

It has always been too bright and harsh, and we only had the standard light switch. I had been thinking about putting a dimmer switch on for years, but never got around to it until now.I chose the TP-Link version because I already have several Kasa Smart Plugs in my household, along with an Amazon Echo that I use to control them. I figured it would be easier to have fewer smart home ecosystems to have to deal with.The installation was easy, but you have to be comfortable with basic wiring and dealing with electricity. You also need to be sure that you have a neutral wire available -- mine was tucked back behind the other wires. Additionally, you should have a voltage sensor handy, as you will need to use it to determine which wire has the electricity running through it when the switch is off. You can purchase a cheap one, but this is a requirement. Once you have done that, you just boot up the Kasa app, and it runs you through everything. Total installation time was about 20 minutes or so.Once you have the switch installed, the app runs you through the set up, and my light was working in no time. It was very easy, and I had no issues.The switch itself looks decent -- when it is off, a white circle of light appears on the switch, which makes it easy to find in the dark, but might be annoying if you are installing this in your bedroom. There is also a brightness control panel above the switch.The only thing to be aware of with this switch is that if you are using LED lights, you want to make sure you have dimmable LEDs. Also, you should try to get some that don't buzz. I was using cheap store brand LEDs that were supposedly dimmable, but they would buzz like crazy at lower light levels and even flicker. I went out and bought some better ones, and it mostly solved the problem. There is no longer any flickering, but just a slight buzz at lower levels that I can definitely deal with.The integration with Alexa is fabulous, as you can turn the light on and off and choose a dimming value with your voice. The app also works well, but I generally use Alexa.Overall, I highly recommend this switch to anyone looking to upgrade their switches and add to their smart home ecosystem. Just be prepared to do some VERY basic wiring.###dimmer<9:15>|overhead<37:45>|dining<46:52>|room<53:57>|dining room<46:57>|dining room light<46:63>|drive<78:85>|nut<89:93>|year<98:103>|always<112:118>|bright<128:134>|standard<166:174>|standard light switch<166:187>|put<215:222>|dimmer<225:231>|year<246:251>|never<257:262>|now<286:289>|choose<292:297>|tp<302:304>|tp link<302:309>|link<305:309>|the tp link<298:309>|version<310:317>|already<328:335>|kasa<349:353>|smart<354:359>|kasa smart<349:359>|plugs<360:365>|household<372:381>|echo<404:408>|control<423:430>|figure<439:446>|easy<459:465>|smart<480:485>|home<486:490>|smart home<480:490>|ecosystem<491:500>|home ecosystem<486:500>|smart home ecosystem<480:500>|ecosystem<491:501>|smart home ecosystem<480:501>|home ecosystem<486:501>|deal<513:517>|installation<527:539>|easy<544:548>|comfortable<569:580>|basic<586:591>|wiring<592:598>|deal<603:607>|deal<603:610>|electricity<616:627>|neutral<670:677>|a neutral wire<668:682>|neutral wire<670:682>|wire<678:682>|available<683:692>|back<712:716>|wire<734:738>|wire<734:739>|additionally<741:753>|voltage<773:780>|sensor<781:787>|handy<788:793>|determine<825:834>|wire<841:845>|electricity<854:865>|run<866:873>|cheap<928:933>|one<934:937>|requirement<953:964>|one<981:984>|kasa<1012:1016>|the kasa app<1008:1020>|kasa app<1012:1020>|run<1029:1033>|total<1058:1063>|installation<1064:1076>|20 minute<1092:1102>|minute<1095:1102>|instal<1134:1143>|run<1153:1157>|set<1174:1177>|easy<1231:1235>|no issue<1247:1256>|issue<1250:1256>|decent<1281:1287>|white<1309:1314>|white circle<1309:1321>|circle<1315:1321>|appear<1331:1338>|easy<1369:1373>|find<1377:1381>|dark<1389:1393>|annoying<1408:1416>|instal<1428:1438>|room<1455:1459>|bedroom<1452:1459>|bright<1477:1483>|brightness<1477:1487>|control<1488:1495>|panel<1496:1501>|aware<1540:1545>|led<1591:1594>|led light<1591:1601>|dimmable<1634:1642>|led<1643:1646>|dimmable led<1634:1647>|led<1643:1647>|buzz<1693:1697>|cheap<1711:1716>|store<1717:1722>|brand<1723:1728>|led<1729:1732>|led<1729:1733>|dimmable<1755:1763>|buzz<1780:1784>|crazy<1790:1795>|low<1799:1804>|level<1811:1817>|flick<1827:1834>|one<1870:1873>|one<1870:1874>|mostly<1883:1889>|solve<1890:1896>|problem<1901:1908>|long<1922:1928>|flick<1933:1940>|flickering<1933:1943>|slight<1956:1962>|buzz<1963:1967>|low<1971:1976>|low level<1971:1983>|level<1977:1983>|definitely<1995:2005>|deal<2006:2010>|integration<2020:2031>|integration with alexa<2020:2042>|alexa<2037:2042>|turn<2067:2071>|choose<2097:2103>|dim<2106:2113>|value<2114:2119>|voice<2130:2135>|generally<2168:2177>|alexa<2182:2187>|overall<2188:2195>|highly<2199:2205>|recommend<2206:2215>|one<2234:2237>|upgrade<2249:2256>|add<2276:2279>|smart<2289:2294>|smart home<2289:2299>|home<2295:2299>|home ecosystem<2295:2309>|ecosystem<2300:2309>|smart home ecosystem<2289:2309>|basic<2344:2349>|wiring<2350:2356>",

I'd tried to read up about it and since my house isn't super new, I wasn't sure if what I had would work. But I shouldn't have worried.Does the wiring to your switch from your breaker box have a black, white, and ground wire (ground is either bare copper or green)? Congrats, you have a neutral wire and all these types of things will Just Work™.I don't know why people make it out like it's an unusual or \"new\" feature of wiring. You'd need REALLY old wiring not to have two wires going into your light switch.  Maybe if you have knob and tube wiring from the early 1900s...Anyway... the setup was really easy... pro tip, there's a QR Code on the inside of the switch itself that the app wants you to scan.... scan that before you install the switch!  You can still set it up via the Kasa app even without the QR code, but you need the code to do it from inside Google/Amazon/Alexa.It installed easily and obviously. It fits in a standard light switch box (though it fills a lot of the space, so you can't have a whole ton of wires hanging around behind it).  It dims my LED lights, and even turns on/off with a nice quick fade in/out.

Kasa has a calibration feature that you can adjust the dimmer range according to the bulb to compensate for flickering. I’ve never seen that on a smart dimmer and I own a few different ones. It works amazingly. I had to run it a couple times until I was happy with the range. As far as installation it fit into the old work box I bought from Walmart no problem. Some smart switches are extra deep and can be difficult to shoehorn into older boxes. I was able to squeeze it into an existing switch box in another room as well.

The switch's touch pad worked well, although the dimmer setting switches were rather small (only complaint).Installation is TIGHT and this unit barely fits into a double switch box having a regular switch on the left. It would be exceedingly difficult installing two of these side by side, but it appears to be possible.April 2022....... It died. Although it's \"I'm on/off\" lights and dimmer level setting lights were operative, there was no outgoing current at any setting. This was confirmed with a quality Fluke Multi Tester.So, it's longevity was 13 months. Making it a buck-and-half-a-month switch.

Physically it is a touch larger than other smart switches.  Also, I put it in a double box with another switch.  This sticks out more so that the plate no longer met the wall.  Looking online later, I found this is a common complaint and a wall plate to correct this is not in the works by the manufacturer.The KASA app is not the most intuitive but I got this to work with it.  I then set out to integrate it to Alexa.  I have other switches that Alexa controls correctly but after 4 hours of research and reloads of apps, I could not get it to respond to voice commands.  It worked using the Alexa app on the phone as a remote but it never got to voice activation.  It's like Alexa in the room could not see it.  It kept seeing the smart switch I removed but not this one.

Overall, prefer 1st gen</b> This switch would've been 5 stars/awesome, if they had kept the original physical design, which used screw terminals. As others have noted, this comes with wires that need to be wire-nutted in place, which adds a lot of bulk. In my case, There were other connections within my single-gang box, and the addition of three more wire nuts was not possible. If this were the original design, I could've simply dropped in the new switch to the old wires, but instead I had to take everything apart, add larger/bulkier wire nuts in order to accommodate the additional wires, and eventually needed a bigger box. Wifi setup was nice and easy, though. Unfortunately, the negative they introduced with this redesign outweigh the positives.

The software integration has been great, only compliments there. In the 3 years since installation, three of the original switches failed and required replacement, all of which have been the 2nd generation models. The problem is that lack of screw terminals means that more room is required for wire nuts in the electrical box. This is all fine and dandy if you have nice clean wiring in your boxes, but I have some absolutely horrendous situations where I need every bit of space I can get. I am so frustrated by this that I think I will migrate away from Leviton switches as they keep failing and I install new ones.###lack<3:7>|screw<11:16>|screw terminal<11:26>|terminal<17:26>|all<32:35>|limit<37:45>|all<56:59>|install<52:59>|instal<52:61>|1st<71:74>|generation<75:85>|1st generation<71:85>|mostly<110:116>|experience<122:132>|software<138:146>|integration<147:158>|year<208:213>|3 year<206:213>|all<224:227>|install<220:227>|installation<220:232>|original<247:255>|fail<265:271>|require<276:284>|replacement<285:296>|all<298:301>|2nd<325:328>|generation<329:339>|the 2nd generation<321:339>|2nd generation<325:339>|generation model<329:346>|model<340:346>|problem<352:359>|lack<368:372>|screw<376:381>|screw terminal<376:391>|terminal<382:391>|mean<392:397>|room<408:412>|require<416:424>|wire<429:433>|nut<434:438>|wire nut<429:438>|electrical<446:456>|box<457:460>|electrical box<446:460>|the electrical box<442:460>|all<470:473>|clean<506:511>|wiring<512:518>|box<527:530>|box<527:532>|absolutely<550:560>|situation<572:582>|space<609:614>|away<681:685>|leviton<691:698>|keep<716:720>|fail<721:728>|install<735:742>|all<739:742>|new<743:746>|one<747:751>|new one<743:751>"

      "Different attachment hardware for dimmers and switches###different<0:9>|attachment<10:20>|hardware<21:29>|dimmer<34:41>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2019-03-08] <b>Great switch, needs more smart actions</b> I installed 25 tp-link switches (combination of dimmer, switch, and 3 way switch) in my home, and one wemo dimmer.Installation: The tp-link dimmers and switches have different attachment hardware (where you screw the switch to attach it to the electric box in the wall). This is annoying because the switches have a thick plastic, while the dimmers are metal but have a piece of plastic that screws onto the top of the front which has to be removed. I personally prefer the dimmer metal hardware. When you install a dimmer next to a switch you have to really fiddle with them to make the two different sizes look the same after the cover is on.What I like:I really like the fact that I can control these from the switch, my phone, or the from google assistant.I also have a in wall wemo dimmer. When I tell google to turn off or on the lights the wemo is significantly slower to respond then the tp-link. For tp-link the lights start to turn on//off in probably .5 sec while the wemo dimmer may take 2-8 seconds to start to respond.Look - the switches and the covers have a bright shiny finish. In most cases I was not able to use the included cover as they are installed in double or triple switch settings, but I like them where I was able to use them.Light compatibility - I've installed these with multiple kinds of dimmable LED lights and they have all functioned well.Light range - I replaced my living room light which originally had the wemo dimmer switch  and I noticed that the tp-link uses a greater range of the light bulb - i.e. it dims more and 100% brightness is brigher which I like.These also pretty quickly reconnect to wifi after I flip the breaker off or power outage (unlike some of my other smart devices that I have to setup over an over again with every power blip)Enhancements I would really like:Enabling third party triggers. I use IFTTT to integrate multiple smart things together. While these dimmers are compatible with IFTTT - they are only able to be used as THAT devices (in the \"if this than that\"(ifttt) recipes). So for example, with my wemo switch, if I wanted to turn on/off some other smart device when I clicked the wemo dimmer switch, I could use the wemo click as a THIS action or trigger. But these switches I can only use to respond to other actions, for example, when my door sensor senses that the door opened I can turn on the entry way light.True Instant on/off: The dimmer switches have a setting where you can change how fast they dim on and off when you click the switch. One option is \"Instant\". When I have it set to instant, it really just dims on/off fast. I have a non dimmer switch right next to a dimmer switch and when I click both at the same time the dimmer light takes longer, probably a second to turn on, while the non-dimmable switch is instant. This would also probably help with non-dimmable lights. I had non-dimmable lights attached to some of my dimmers and these acted very poorly even when set to instant on. They really buzzed and some even continued to buzz loudly while on.Always on circle  light in switch - In places where I have three dimmers together, when I turn one light on, that switches circle on the switch turns off. When I go to turn the light off I instantly think that the switches with the light on are the ones that are on, so I click those two only to find that neither of those lights were on and end up cycling through all three switches.In the kasa app when you select a dimmer or a switch the UI is completely different, it would be nice for them to be more similar.What I don't like -The click. About 1 out of every 4 times that I click the switch it doesn't turn on/off. Probably similar to learning to double click on a computer mouse for the first time (for those that can remember that). This could also probably be resolved with the instant on/off I mentioned before. Because it takes about a second even on instant on for the light to come to full power, when you click on and didn't click hard enough you end up walking past the switch thinking it is just takings its second to dim on, but then you have to walk back to the switch once it actually doesn't work. Some of my switches also have a bit of a squeaky click, which is also annoying.Note about 3-way switches - Even though my house was built fairly recently, for every set of three way switches, only one of the two wall wirings has the white wire. Luckily these can be paired with an old dumb three way switch and work quite well (i.e. you can use a single 2 pack of 3-way switches for two separate sets of 3-way sockets)Note about wifi - I have mesh wifi in a smallish house so my wifi coverage is good throughout and wifi connectivity has not been an issue for switches.Update Feb 2020:Smart actions - Auto off action. I really like this feature. I have my bathroom vent fans set to auto off after 15 minutes, and I think it has always worked except for one time my WiFi was down. The problem, your only allowed 3 smart actions. I’d love to be able to set more. My son uses the bathroom at the far end of my house and leaves the light on every time. A 15 minute auto off would be perfect. It would also work for closet and hallway lights. TP-link please add more smart actions.###smart<28:33>|action<34:40>|action<34:41>|smart action<28:41>|install<48:55>|all<52:55>|instal<48:57>|tp<61:63>|link<64:68>|tp link<61:68>|tp link

      "Smaller screws supplied###small<0:7>|screw<8:14>|supply<15:23>|||B079775ZZQ ★★☆☆☆ [2022-09-26] <b>Disappointed</b> So many small things disappoint about this product. The photo shows what happens when a max sized switch must fit in a min sized box. No room left. Even the screws supplied are a little smaller to make the over-thick tabs fit within the cover plate, barely. The worst is the device is limited to 3 active programs. That means if you have 4 switches in your house, you can only schedule 3 to turn off/on automatically. Alexa can be used to work around this ridiculous limitation. There must be better options out there.###disappointed<3:15>|small<28:33>|disappoint<41:51>|photo<76:81>|show<82:87>|happen<93:100>|max<108:111>|fit<130:133>|min<139:142>|box<149:152>|room<157:161>|leave<162:166>|screw<177:183>|supply<184:192>|small<206:211>|small<206:213>|thick<231:236>|tab<237:241>|fit<242:245>|cover<257:262>|cover plate<257:268>|plate<263:268>|the cover plate<253:268>|barely<270:276>|device<295:301>|limit<305:312>|program<325:333>|mean<340:345>|house<377:382>|schedule<397:405>|turn<411:415>|automatically<423:436>|alexa<438:443>|ridiculous<476:486>|limitation<487:497>|option<520:527>",

      "Short screws provided for attaching the base###short<0:5>|screw<6:12>|provide<13:21>|attach<26:35>|base<40:44>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★☆☆☆ [2025-02-23] <b>Significant downgrade from the Gen 1 switches, removed support for 5Ghz WiFi</b> I already have multiple Leviton smart switches installed in my home as well as some installed in my parents house.  I have been very happy with these switches and have recommended them to multiple people over the years.I wanted to replace another switch in my home with a smart switch and honestly did not even consider any other brand besides Leviton.  I did however decided to get one of the newer 2nd generation switches that (supposedly) supports Matter, figuring it would be more future proof.For starters, the installation wasn't terrible, but wasn't any easier than the Gen 1 switches I have installed before.  Was hoping that the body of the switch would have shrunk a bit making for easier installation in tight switch boxes in our older home.After I got the install done I had a TERRIBLE time getting the switch trim plate on.  The trim plate is two pieces, the first piece (let's call it the base) is screwed onto the switch and the second snaps onto the first.  Well the screws that are provided to attach the base to the switch are very short.  This would not be such a big problem except that the holes don't line up well.  Eventually after much frustration I was able to get it on by backing the screws that held the switch in place but even then it doesn't feel secure.  I sure hope I can use a standard decora trim plate on this switch because I think I'm going to need to replace it.2nd problem was when I went to configure it, I already had the My Leviton app installed on my phone to support my existing switches.  I was able to connect the app to the new switch but was not able to see or select the network I wanted.  After more frustration I discovered that inexplicably Leviton decided to REMOVE support for 5Ghz WiFi networks.  I know that 2.4Ghz only WiFi chips are slightly cheaper than ones that support both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz but this level of feature cutting is a very bad sign.Honestly the primary reason I selected Leviton switches over TP-Link or others was the support for 5Ghz WiFi.  Leviton has deleted their sole competitive advantage over other, less expensive smart switches.Finally, as for the supposed Matter support.  I will admit I don't know a lot about Matter but I did try to use Matter to add it to my Google Home (instead of using the linked connection to the My Leviton app) but was unable to.  Google wanted me to scan a QR code on the box but the only QR coded on the box or in the manuals did not work and neither the box nor the manual said anything at all about Matter support.  So who knows if this device even supports Matter like the listing says it does, in any case I could not get it to work.Honestly, if it wouldn't have been such a PITA to rip this switch out of the wall and return it I would have.I did give 2* instead of 1 because it _does_ work.  I was able to get it connected to my Google Home via the link to My Leviton and am able to control it but it's fallen FAR short of my expectations.###significant<3:14>|downgrade<15:24>|gen<34:37>|remove<50:57>|support<58:65>|wifi<75:79>|already<86:93>|multiple<99:107>|leviton<108:115>|smart<116:121>|leviton smart switch<108:130>|all<135:138>|install<131:138>|instal<131:140>|home<147:151>|install<168:175>|all<172:175>|instal<168:177>|parent<184:191>|house<192:197>|happy<217:222>|recommend<252:263>|multiple<272:280>|people<281:287>|year<297:302>|replace<315:322>|place<317:322>|home<344:348>|smart<356:361>|one<374:377>|one<374:378>|honestly<373:381>|consider<395:403>|other brand<408:419>|brand<414:419>|leviton<428:435>|however<444:451>|decide<452:459>|one<467:470>|new<478:481>|new<478:483>|2nd<484:487>|generation<488:498>|2nd generation<484:498>|suppose<514:522>|support<526:533>|support<526:534>|matter<535:541>|figure<543:551>|future<569:575>|future proof<569:581>|proof<576:581>|all<604:607>|install<600:607>|installation<600:612>|easy<645:651>|gen<661:664>|all<687:690>|install<683:690>|instal<683:692>|hope<706:712>|body<722:726>|easy<776:782>|install<783:790>|all<787:790>|installation<783:795>|easy installation<776:795>|tight<799:804>|box<812:815>|box<812:817>|old<825:830>|old home<825:835>|home<831:835>|install<852:859>|all<856:859>|one<861:864>|trim<906:910>|trim plate<906:916>|plate<911:916>|trim<926:930>|plate<931:936>|trim plate<926:936>|piece<944:949>|piece<944:950>|first<956:961>|piece<962:967>|let<969:972>|all<976:979>|call<975:979>|base<987:991>|screw<996:1003>|second<1028:1034>|snap<1035:1040>|first<1050:1055>|screw<1067:1073>|provide<1083:1091>|attach<1095:1101>|base<1106:1110>|short<1134:1139>|big<1167:1170>|problem<1171:1178>|hole<1195:1200>|line<1207:1211>|all<1228:1231>|eventually<1222:1232>|frustration<1244:1255>|able<1262:1266>|back<1283:1290>|screw<1295:1301>|hold<1307:1311>|place<1326:1331>|feel<1357:1361>|secure<1362:1368>|hope<1378:1382>|standard<1395:1403>|decora<1404:1410>|standard decora<1395:1410>|trim<1411:1415>|trim plate<1411:1421>|plate<1416:1421>|replace<1474:1481>|place<1476:1481>|2nd<1485:1488>|problem<1489:1496>|configure<1516:1525>|already<1532:1539>|leviton<1551:1558>|leviton app<1551:1562>|all<1567:1570>|install<1563:1570>|instal<1563:1572>|one<1581:1584>|phone<1579:1584>|support<1588:1595>|exist<1599:1607>|able<1625:1629>|connect<1633:1640>|new<1656:1659>|able<1679:1683>|select<1694:1700>|network<1705:1712>|frustration<1735:1746>|discover<1749:1759>|leviton<1778:1785>|decide<1786:1793>|remove<1797:1803>|support<1804:1811>|wifi<1821:1825>|network<1826:1833>|wifi network<1821:1834>|network<1826:1834>|wifi<1861:1865>|slightly<1876:1884>|cheap<1885:1892>|one<1898:1901>|one<1898:1902>|support<1908:1915>|level<1946:1951>|feature<1955:1962>|sign<1985:1989>|one<1991:1994>|one<1991:1995>|honestly<1990:1998>|primary<2003:2010>|reason<2011:2017>|select<2020:2026>|select<2020:2028>|leviton<2029:2036>|tp<2051:2053>|link<2054:2058>|tp link<2051:2058>|support<2077:2084>|wifi<2094:2098>|leviton<2101:2108>|let<2115:2118>|delete<2113:2120>|less<2166:2170>|expensive<2171:2180>|smart<2181:2186>|all<2199:2202>|finally<2196:2203>|suppose<2216:2224>|matter<2225:2231>|support<2232:2239>|matter support<2225:2239>|admit<2249:2254>|matter<2280:2286>|matter<2308:2314>|add<2318:2321>|google<2331:2337>|home<2338:2342>|google home<2331:2342>|instead<2344:2351>|link<2365:2369>|link<2365:2371>|connect<2372:2379>|connection<2372:2382>|leviton<2393:2400>|leviton app<2393:2404>|unable<2414:2420>|able<2416:2420>|google<2426:2432>|scan<2446:2450>|qr<2453:2455>|a qr code<2451:2460>|qr code<2453:2460>|code<2456:2460>|box<2468:2471>|qr<2485:2487>|qr code<2485:2492>|code<2488:2492>|code<2488:2493>|qr code<2485:2493>|box<2501:2504>|manual<2515:2521>|manual<2515:2522>|box<2552:2555>|manual<2564:2570>|all<2588:2591>|matter<2598:2604>|support<2605:2612>|matter support<2598:2612>|device<2636:2642>|support<2648:2655>|support<2648:2656>|matter<2657:2663>|listing<2673:2680>|case<2702:2706>|one<2735:2738>|one<2735:2739>|honestly<2734:2742>|rip<2784:2787>|all<2812:2815>|wall<2811:2815>|return<2820:2826>|give<2849:2853>|instead<2857:2864>|able<2901:2905>|connect<2916:2923>|connect<2916:2925>|google<2932:2938>|home<2939:2943>|google home<2932:2943>|link<2952:2956>|leviton<2963:2970>|able<2978:2982>|control<2986:2993>|all<3007:3010>|fall<3006:3012>|far<3013:3016>|short<3017:3022>|expectation<3029:3041>",

Do I have to buy electrical wires separately to install these?

I had to spend an hour with their online chat support and that was pretty incompetent to. So finally I did some research and had to buy 14AWG wire from Home Depot to connect the line and the load.

      "Dimmers have metal attachment with removable plastic piece###dimmer<0:7>|metal<13:18>|attachment<19:29>|plastic<45:52>|piece<53:58>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2019-03-08] <b>Great switch, needs more smart actions</b> I installed 25 tp-link switches (combination of dimmer, switch, and 3 way switch) in my home, and one wemo dimmer.Installation: The tp-link dimmers and switches have different attachment hardware (where you screw the switch to attach it to the electric box in the wall). This is annoying because the switches have a thick plastic, while the dimmers are metal but have a piece of plastic that screws onto the top of the front which has to be removed. I personally prefer the dimmer metal hardware. When you install a dimmer next to a switch you have to really fiddle with them to make the two different sizes look the same after the cover is on.What I like:I really like the fact that I can control these from the switch, my phone, or the from google assistant.I also have a in wall wemo dimmer. When I tell google to turn off or on the lights the wemo is significantly slower to respond then the tp-link. For tp-link the lights start to turn on//off in probably .5 sec while the wemo dimmer may take 2-8 seconds to start to respond.Look - the switches and the covers have a bright shiny finish. In most cases I was not able to use the included cover as they are installed in double or triple switch settings, but I like them where I was able to use them.Light compatibility - I've installed these with multiple kinds of dimmable LED lights and they have all functioned well.Light range - I replaced my living room light which originally had the wemo dimmer switch  and I noticed that the tp-link uses a greater range of the light bulb - i.e. it dims more and 100% brightness is brigher which I like.These also pretty quickly reconnect to wifi after I flip the breaker off or power outage (unlike some of my other smart devices that I have to setup over an over again with every power blip)Enhancements I would really like:Enabling third party triggers. I use IFTTT to integrate multiple smart things together. While these dimmers are compatible with IFTTT - they are only able to be used as THAT devices (in the \"if this than that\"(ifttt) recipes). So for example, with my wemo switch, if I wanted to turn on/off some other smart device when I clicked the wemo dimmer switch, I could use the wemo click as a THIS action or trigger. But these switches I can only use to respond to other actions, for example, when my door sensor senses that the door opened I can turn on the entry way light.True Instant on/off: The dimmer switches have a setting where you can change how fast they dim on and off when you click the switch. One option is \"Instant\". When I have it set to instant, it really just dims on/off fast. I have a non dimmer switch right next to a dimmer switch and when I click both at the same time the dimmer light takes longer, probably a second to turn on, while the non-dimmable switch is instant. This would also probably help with non-dimmable lights. I had non-dimmable lights attached to some of my dimmers and these acted very poorly even when set to instant on. They really buzzed and some even continued to buzz loudly while on.Always on circle  light in switch - In places where I have three dimmers together, when I turn one light on, that switches circle on the switch turns off. When I go to turn the light off I instantly think that the switches with the light on are the ones that are on, so I click those two only to find that neither of those lights were on and end up cycling through all three switches.In the kasa app when you select a dimmer or a switch the UI is completely different, it would be nice for them to be more similar.What I don't like -The click. About 1 out of every 4 times that I click the switch it doesn't turn on/off. Probably similar to learning to double click on a computer mouse for the first time (for those that can remember that). This could also probably be resolved with the instant on/off I mentioned before. Because it takes about a second even on instant on for the light to come to full power, when you click on and didn't click hard enough you end up walking past the switch thinking it is just takings its second to dim on, but then you have to walk back to the switch once it actually doesn't work. Some of my switches also have a bit of a squeaky click, which is also annoying.Note about 3-way switches - Even though my house was built fairly recently, for every set of three way switches, only one of the two wall wirings has the white wire. Luckily these can be paired with an old dumb three way switch and work quite well (i.e. you can use a single 2 pack of 3-way switches for two separate sets of 3-way sockets)Note about wifi - I have mesh wifi in a smallish house so my wifi coverage is good throughout and wifi connectivity has not been an issue for switches.Update Feb 2020:Smart actions - Auto off action. I really like this feature. I have my bathroom vent fans set to auto off after 15 minutes, and I think it has always worked except for one time my WiFi was down. The problem, your only allowed 3 smart actions. I’d love to be able to set more. My son uses the bathroom at the far end of my house and leaves the light on every time. A 15 minute auto off would be perfect. It would also work for closet and hallway lights. TP-link please add more smart actions.###smart<28:33>|action<34:40>|action<34:41>|smart action<28:41>|install<48:55>|all<52:55>|instal<48:57>|tp<61:63>|link<64:68>|tp link<61:68>|tp link

So I bought this to replace that dimmer and it works great. Lights get MUCH dimmer than before, very stable. Fade up and down very smoothly. Being app controlled is a nice bonus.  My ONLY complaint is the thickness of the mounting flange. This was with 3 other switches so cant use the included plate, and the plate i bought will not sit flush against the wall due to the think plastic mounting tabs.  Metal tabs like a normal switch has would be better.###lead<67:70>|bulb<71:76>|old<102:105>|dim<113:116>|dimmer<113:119>|dim<134:137>|shut<150:158>|completely<163:173>|replace<195:202>|dim<208:211>|dimmer<208:214>|dim<251:254>|dimmer<251:257>|stable<276:282>|fade<284:288>|down<296:300>|smoothly<306:314>|control<326:336>|bonus<347:352>|complaint<363:372>|only complaint<358:372>|thickness<380:389>|mount<397:405>|flange<406:412>|include<461:469>|plate<470:475>|plate<485:490>|sit<509:512>|flush<513:518>|wall<531:535>|plastic<553:560>|mount<561:569>|tab<570:574>|metal<577:582>|tab<583:587>|normal<595:601>|a normal switch<593:608>",

It connects to WiFi easily through the Kasa app, has adjustable dimmer limits, and works with Google Home to both turn on/off and to dim.The minor downsides is the size of the switch making it hard to fit it in the old boxes from the 60s which are in my house and the plate.  The plate is proprietary which seems unnecessary, and larger than it needs to be/normal Decora plates are.Overall though, I'm happy with it and plant to get a couple more of these and several of the 3 way ones.###minor<15:20>|downside<21:30>|description<77:88>|connect<94:102>|wifi<106:110>|easily<111:117>|kasa<130:134>|the kasa app<126:138>|kasa app<130:138>|adjustable<144:154>|dim<155:158>|dimmer<155:161>|limit<162:168>|google<185:191>|home<192:196>|google home<185:196>|turn<205:209>|dim<224:227>|minor<232:237>|downside<238:247>|size<255:259>|hard<284:288>|fit<292:295>|old<306:309>|box<310:315>|house<345:350>|plate<359:364>|plate<371:376>|proprietary<380:391>|large<421:427>|normal<448:454>|decora<455:461>|plate<462:467>|plate<462:468>|overall<473:480>|though<481:487>|happy<493:498>|a couple<524:532>|couple<526:532>|3 way<566:571>|one<572:576>",
      "Intended for single switch###intend<0:8>|single<13:19>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2020-08-14] <b>Replaced every switch in my home with these</b> I used this switch to replace virtually ever switch in my home, including their 3-way switches, and non-dimmer switches. Overall, install was about what you'd expect, however I do have a few comments and things you might want to consider:1) The back of these things are HUGE. I have a house built in 1980 with standard flip switches. On top of that, most of my light switches were in 3 gang boxes, making it already crowded. Installing these was a huge pain, as I had to shift wires around relentlessly, cut/strip/rewire to find ways to make these things fit. Each install took a good hour or two to get things in place.2) Although it worked in multiple gang outlets, these are clearly intended for a single switch, given their thickness of the external plate (which the cover attaches directly to).3) These connect directly to wifi through 2.4ghz. While this may sound like a good thing, once you add a dozen of these to your home, you will find your network is quickly bogged down with all the signals/interference.

I have an expensive smart dimmer in another spot and the mounting plate was thinner so the switch plate fit the wall well.Side note, the privacy policy for using the app is less private than I would like.

Overall, install was about what you'd expect, however I do have a few comments and things you might want to consider:1) The back of these things are HUGE. I have a house built in 1980 with standard flip switches. On top of that, most of my light switches were in 3 gang boxes, making it already crowded. Installing these was a huge pain, as I had to shift wires around relentlessly, cut/strip/rewire to find ways to make these things fit. Each install took a good hour or two to get things in place.2) Although it worked in multiple gang outlets, these are clearly intended for a single switch, given their thickness of the external plate (which the cover attaches directly to).3) These connect directly to wifi through 2.4ghz. While this may sound like a good thing, once you add a dozen of these to your home, you will find your network is quickly bogged down with all the signals/interference. This created intermittent wifi problems for me, of which now I will probably have to get a better router to handle the new traffic. I imagine a z-wave + hub alternative would have solved this since they would all be routed through a single hub signal, not 10+ individual connects.Overall, they look good, the app is great, the Google home integrations are endless, and I'm planning to keep these as part of the house.

I started replacing my switches a few years ago with the Gen1 switches and just recently finished out with the Gen2.  The only switches that aren't these are my bathroom exhaust fans.  I've written quite a lot here so congrats if you make it through to the end.The switches I have in use now are:DW6HD (Gen1 600W Dimmer)DW1KD (1000W Dimmer, Gen1 but still uses leads instead of screws)DW15S (Gen1 Switch)DW4SF (Gen1 4 Speed Fan Controller, also uses leads over screws)D26HD (Gen2 600W Dimmer)D215S (Gen2 Switch)DAWDC (Gen2 wireless dimmer companion)DAWSC (Gen2 wireless switch companion)Overall I am very happy with my switches.  I have not had issues with constant dropping as some have said here.  The app works well and I really like the Away feature in it though the same can be accomplished through Alexa.  Integration with Alexa works fine.  Alexa usually picks up a new switch and let's me know it's connected before I can finish entering the name I want for the device.  That's not an issue as it updates automatically once I enter the name I like.  They also integrate well with Samsung SmartThings.  I use that as I was accidentally sent some ZWave Leviton switches when I ordered WiFi ones so I put them to use rather than throwing them away as Amazon suggested.  I also really like that for anyone visiting they work just as you'd expect a normal switch to vs using something like smart bulbs where if the power gets cut things can go a bit funny.  My OCD also likes that these don't stick out/lean one way or the other when switched on/off.  They're very unassuming looking which to me is good.My house is only a few years old, none of the switch boxes are metal and just about everywhere has a neutral wire already in the box.  The only places I had issues were in some of the 3-way switches where whoever wired the house seemed to cut some corners and didn't run all the wiring these require, along with not keeping things in their standard place (e.g. red wire hot, black wire traveler, etc.)  so for a while some of my 3-way switches weren't 3-way.  The Gen2 wireless switch companions remedied this though.Like many others, in general I prefer the screw terminals.  However, there were a couple of instances where having the leads was handy.  For the neutral wire I did like using the lead as it is more flexible than cutting a piece of 14/2 and using that.  In my kitchen dual gang box, which was very crowded even before I changed the switches, it did actually save me some space as I could get rid of the extra rigid wiring and use the existing wire nut already in the box on the house neutrals so I wasn't adding anything.  The other instance I preferred the leads was in a bedroom.  Whoever wired the boxes liked to strip a portion of the hot wire, loop that around the hot terminal on the switch and then terminate the hot wire on the second switch in the box rather than using a wire nut with two leads coming off of it.  Both switches were connected on a continuous hot wire.  I was able to cut the wire down to the stripped part and then just nut both switch hot/black wires to the house hot wire.  The looping method they used is a pain with the screw terminals on the Gen1, but I've made it work before.  The leads made that easier however, overall I would prefer the screw terminals.The wireless switch/dimmer companions are awesome.  They solved my 3-way wiring issue and are super easy to setup.  I was afraid there may be some delay after pushing the rocker, but it's an instant response.  If you're using Gen2 switches and wish you had a 3-way light somewhere you don't these make a really easy fix for that especially since you can stick them to a bare wall with the included adhesive pads.  Hopefully the battery life lives up to the stated 5 years, but I won't hold my breath.I also really like the fan controllers.  I have pull chain ceiling fans without remotes in all bedrooms and the living room and these make it really to control the fan speed either with the switch itself, voice, or an app.  Much better than my short wife trying to stand on something to pull the chain.Gen1 vs Gen2As stated above, overall I like the screw terminals better than the leads on the Gen 2.Updating the switch firmware is easier on Gen2.  In the My Leviton app you can choose to Update All Gen2 switches at once.  For Gen1 switches you have to do them individually still.  Gets old fast when you have a lot of them.  The addition of the wireless switch companions for Gen2 is great.  I don't use Apple Homekit so I can't speak to how Gen2 works there.ISSUESMost of the issues I've encountered have been more the fault of the house wiring or some other external factor rather than an issue with any of the switches themselves, but they're not without fault.-- Some LED bulbs just don't play nice with the dimmers.  Maybe this is my fault for trying the less expensive bulbs, but I've noticed the EcoSmart from Home Depot don't always dim very well.  Other brands work better, but I have yet to find an LED bulb/switch combo that gives 1) the dimming range or 2) dimming smoothness and 3) no flicker on dimmer settings than 100% of an incandescent bulb.  You can get one or two, but not all 3.-- I have had some disconnects.  I haven't had enough that I'd call it unusable or a deal breaker, but it happens. Most things with wifi will sometimes drop.  This is much easier to deal with on the dimmer switches since you can pull out the bottom dimmer rocker and it cuts power to the switch effectively letting you reset its connection.  I wish the plain switches had something similar where I could cut their power without having to flip a breaker.  Honestly, when a non-dimmer isn't connected I don't do anything.  It'll eventually reconnect but sometimes it's a day and sometimes it's a few days.  If there was an easily accessible reset button on the plain switch that would make things so much easier.--  I have had 1 switch (out of 26) just up and die on me... so far any way.  It was in my super crowded kitchen dual gang box which I think contributed to its death.  However, and this is a plus, Leviton support was great.  They walked me through some steps (which I had already tried, but I understand they need to check their boxes) and then they sent me a new switch.  It was all handled very well, no run around or anything.  Also, since it was a Gen1 switch that has been discontinued they replaced it with a Gen2 equivalent.Overall I am very pleased with the switches and how they operate day to day.  If the one hadn't died and they could address the resets on the plain switches I'd give them 5 stars all day.  I'm not sure who to blame for the dimming, if it's Leviton or LED bulbs in general so for the moment I won't hold that against them.  Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.###nearly<12:18>|house<38:43>|version<61:68>|control<87:94>|control<87:98>|nearly<99:105>|house<123:128>|start<133:140>|replace<141:150>|year<169:174>|few

      "Screwless plate for single switches###screwless<0:9>|plate<10:15>|single<20:26>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2020-09-18] <b>Every Switch in the house is Kasa ---> NO REGRETS!!!</b> We built a new home (3100 sq ft) and every switch in the house is Kasa and we have absolutely no regrets.In our previous home we used a few z-wave switches and paired them to a wink hub.  This overall was pretty good but it wasnt good enough that I wanted to do the whole new house in them so I went looking for another solution/path.I ordered a few different switches. paired them up with our google home and ultimately ended up with Kasa as our choice and ordered 70+ switches (this included some dimmers, some not, as well as their 3 way kits).We got them all installed, paired up and just like in my previous test, every last one of them worked flawless.Below are a list of positives:  -- DIMMER SETTING - The dimmers have a awesome feature where you can set the lowest level of dimming so that if your bulbs pulsate or anything you can get rid of that.  -- Operation speed - no matter if controlling via the actuall switch or throug google home the speed is instantaneous.  This is one things that blew my mind as our previous z-wave/wink hub combo would often take a few trys and/or take a second to actually turn on.  -- The Kasa App - There are a few other products in our home that are not TP-Link brand and while they work fine, the applications that you have to configure the device in and/or the application that you pair up with Google Home seem like an afterthought.  The Kasa app is a solid piece of software that literally has worked flawlessly as we paired all of our switches.The Negatives (dont let these sway you to not buy but...)  -- the size of the switch.  If you have a ton of wires and or a super shallow box in the wall it may not work or you may have problems pushing it in.  I noted the size of the switches to the builder but it unfortunately didnt make it to our electrician and they used standard sized boxes.  The switches all ultimately fit but some of them took some work.  (BTW.. this is a universal \"problem\" amongst all smart switches.  -- REALLY NIT PICKY --the switches come with a beautiful \"screwless\" plate however if you have a multi gang box (multiple switches in the same box) then you will need to find another plate.  We tried a few screwless designs and ultimately stuck with these plates but the switches dont fit perfectly flush with these plates.  This is especially true if you have dimmer/non dimmer/3 way switches in the same box as all of those switches seem to have different thickness backing plates on the switch.Overall, these are awesome, work great and I would do it again in a heartbeat!!!###house<23:28>|kasa<32:36>|build<63:68>|new<71:74>|home<75:79>|ft<89:91>|house<117:122>|kasa<126:130>|absolutely<143:153>|regret<157:164>|previous<172:180>|home<181:185>|wave<202:206>|z wave<200:206>|pair<220:224>|pair<220:226>|hub<242:245>|all<257:260>|overall<253:260>|pretty<265:271>|whole<326:331>|new<332:335>|house<336:341>|solution<380:388>|different<410:419>|pair<430:434>|pair<430:436>|google<454:460>|home<461:465>|google home<454:465>|ultimately<470:480>|end<481:486>|kasa<495:499>|choice<507:513>|include<545:553>|dimmer<559:565>|dimmer<559:566>|3 way<595:600>|all<619:622>|all<627:630>|instal<623:632>|pair<634:638>|pair<634:640>|previous<664:672>|test<673:677>|last<685:689>|flawless<709:717>|list<730:734>|dimmer<753:759>|setting<760:767>|dimmer<774:780>|dimmer<774:781>|feature<797:804>|set<819:822>|low<827:833>|low level<827:839>|level<834:839>|dim<843:850>|bulb<867:872>|rid<905:908>|operation<922:931>|speed<932:937>|matter<943:949>|control<953:964>|all<977:980>|google<998:1004>|google home<998:1009>|home<1005:1009>|speed<1014:1019>|mind<1071:1075>|previous<1083:1091>|z wave<1092:1098>|wave<1094:1098>|hub<1104:1107>|combo<1108:1113>|ft<1121:1123>|often<1120:1125>|second<1156:1162>|all<1170:1173>|actually<1166:1174>|turn<1175:1179>|kasa<1192:1196>|kasa app<1192:1200>|the kasa app<1188:1200>|home<1241:1245>|tp<1259:1261>|link<1262:1266>|brand<1267:1272>|application<1303:1314>|application<1303:1315>|configure<1333:1342>|device<1347:1353>|application<1368:1379>|pair<1389:1393>|google<1402:1408>|home<1409:1413>|google home<1402:1413>|ft<1428:1430>|kasa<1446:1450>|the kasa app<1442:1454>|kasa app<1446:1454>|solid<1460:1465>|piece<1466:1471>|ft<1477:1479>|software<1475:1483>|all<1494:1497>|literally<1489:1498>|flawless<1510:1518>|flawlessly<1510:1520>|pair<1527:1531>|pair<1527:1533>|all<1534:1537>|negative<1558:1567>|let<1574:1577>|size<1620:1624>|ton<1655:1658>|a ton<1653:1658>|wire<1662:1667>|super<1677:1682>|all<1685:1688>|shallow<1683:1690>|box<1691:1694>|wall<1702:1706>|all<1703:1706>|problem<1739:1746>|problem<1739:1747>|push<1748:1755>|note<1766:1771>|size<1776:1780>|unfortunately<1819:1832>|electrician<1854:1865>|standard<1880:1888>|size<1889:1893>|box<1895:1898>|box<1895:1900>|all<1916:1919>|ultimately<1920:1930>|fit<1931:1934>|btw<1970:1973>|problem<1997:2004>|all<2014:2017>|smart<2018:2023>|screwless<2093:2102>|plate<2104:2109>|however<2110:2117>|multi<2132:2137>|multi gang<2132:2142>|gang<2138:2142>|a multi gang<2130:2142>|box<2143:2146>|gang box<2138:2146>|multi gang box<2132:2146>|multi<2148:2153>|multiple<2148:2156>|same<2173:2177>|box<2178:2181>|the same box<2169:2181>|find<2205:2209>|plate<2218:2223>|screwless<2241:2250>|design<2251:2258>|ultimately<2263:2273>|stick<2274:2279>|plate<2291:2296>|plate<2291:2297>|fit<2320:2323>|perfectly<2324:2333>|flush<2334:2339>|plate<2351:2356>|plate<2351:2357>|all<2374:2377>|especially<2368:2378>|dimmer<2396:2402>|non<2403:2406>|dimmer<2407:2413>|3 way<2414:2419>|same<2436:2440>|box<2441:2444>|the same box<2432:2444>|all<2448:2451>|different<2483:2492>|thickness<2493:2502>|back<2503:2510>|plate<2511:2516>|plate<2511:2517>|overall<2532:2539>|all<2536:2539>|again<2589:2594>",

      "Shiny plastic looks cheap###plastic<6:13>|cheap<20:25>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★☆☆ [2021-01-23] <b>Good but a few flaws.</b> I wanted to like this more but it's got a few flaws. The pros are great: affordable; the Kasa ecosystem is great; Alexa integration is solid and easy to use.The cons that kill it for me are:1) It's just not as visually appealing, or functionally appealing, as Lutron Casetas. This one is just kind of ugly-- which I know is subjective-- and the shiny plastic looks kind of cheap. Again, Lutron has this dialed in. Theirs just look nicer.2) \"Away\" mode is a great idea (and Lutron doesn't have it.) This is the feature that will turn lights on and off randomly during 'away' time to make it look like you are home. Great idea but the implementation could be better. It doesn't allow you to set it into the following day. (For example, if you want it to be Away from 8pm til 4am, you can't. You have to end it at 11:59pm. Although you could also set a second one to start at 12:01am and run to 4:00am, but... ugh. Kasa, just fix that.) And it doesn't allow you to schedule it in the future, like \"Away from March 3rd through 10th.\"Hopefully Kasa can address these two things in the future. The second is just software so it should be easier, and it's the bigger issue of the two IMO.###flaw<18:23>|flaw<75:80>|pro<86:90>|affordable<102:112>|kasa<118:122>|ecosystem<123:132>|kasa ecosystem<118:132>|alexa<143:148>|alexa integration<143:160>|integration<149:160>|solid<164:169>|easy<174:178>|con<190:194>|kill<200:204>|visually<239:247>|lutron<289:295>|set<298:301>|one<310:313>|kind<322:326>|plastic<380:387>|kind<394:398>|cheap<402:407>|again<409:414>|lutron<416:422>|away<470:474>|mode<476:480>|idea<492:496>|great idea<486:496>|lutron<502:508>|feature<539:546>|turn<557:561>|randomly<580:588>|away<597:601>|home<637:641>|idea<649:653>|great idea<643:653>|allow<705:710>|set<718:721>|day<744:747>|am<756:758>|example<754:761>|away<784:788>|pm<795:797>|am<803:805>|end<830:833>|pm<845:847>|set<873:876>|second<879:885>|a second one<877:889>|one<886:889>|start<893:898>|am<907:909>|run<914:917>|am<925:927>|kasa<941:945>|fix<952:955>|allow<978:983>|schedule<991:999>|future<1010:1016>|away<1024:1028>|3rd<1040:1043>|kasa<1068:1072>|address<1077:1084>|future<1109:1115>|second<1121:1127>|software<1136:1144>|easy<1161:1167>|big<1182:1188>|issue<1189:1194>|big issue<1182:1194>",

      "Plastic construction###plastic<0:7>|construction<8:20>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★☆☆ [2020-10-21] <b>Poor customer service, \"Cheap\" plastic sound using the switch</b> This is a product that has massive swings on what's great and what's not. The Google Home integration is fantastic, the app is very easy to use once you're installed.Set up of the HS220 is the same as the HS200. The only \"glitch\" is searching for your own WIFI signal, it first comes back as no SSID's, but search again you'll find it. My issue was with an LED Large bathroom mirror. It already head a Dimmer, but swapped it out for the Kasa HS220. It would not Dim, but I know this mirror is compatible with dimmer switches. I installed the HS220 on a chandelier, no issues and compared the set up. I attempted to hard reset the switch, but still wouldn't work. When calibrating I would not say any dimming and going to low, the light would just turn off completely. Here is what's even worse, Kasa Tech support is chat only. After 65 minutes and what appear to be an agent either chatting with multiple people or with no skills, I had to give up. Next day I went to register the switches in order get a warranty replacement and the Kasa website indicated the serial numbers didn't exist. Then again on to chat support 90 minutes and despite giving them the AMazon Receipt and pics of the serial numbers, they had to manually enter them. Worse - no responses for a warranty replacement. Almost 3 hours of Chat support to get no where.Finally, these switches are great when they work. Highly responsive with Google Assistant, app works great. I must say that the sound it makes turning it on and off manually is a hollow cheap plastic sound. Nothing like a quality switch would be. Between the Tech support being the worse I've encountered compared to Hue and others, and the serial numbers not being recognized and poor \"all around\" support, I would not buy this item again.###customer<8:16>|poor customer<3:16>|service<17:24>|customer service<8:24>|cheap<27:32>|plastic<34:41>|sound<42:47>|google<147:153>|home<154:158>|google home<147:158>|the google home<143:158>|home integration<154:170>|integration<159:170>|google home integration<147:170>|easy<201:205>|all<229:232>|instal<225:234>|set<235:238>|same<262:266>|glitch<291:297>|search<302:308>|search<302:311>|own<321:324>|wifi<325:329>|signal<330:336>|wifi signal<325:336>|first<341:346>|back<353:357>|ssid<364:368>|search<376:382>|again<383:388>|find<396:400>|issue<408:413>|lead<426:429>|large<430:435>|bathroom<436:444>|already<456:463>|dim<471:474>|dimmer<471:477>|swap<483:490>|kasa<506:510>|dim<531:534>|compatible<562:572>|dimmer<578:584>|all<601:604>|instal<597:606>|chandelier<622:632>|issue<637:642>|issue<637:643>|no issue<634:643>|compare<648:656>|set<661:664>|attempt<671:680>|hard<684:688>|reset<689:694>|set<691:694>|still<711:716>|calibrate<737:748>|dimming<769:776>|low<790:793>|turn<816:820>|completely<825:835>|kasa<864:868>|tech<869:873>|support<874:881>|tech support<869:881>|chat<885:889>|minute<905:912>|appear<922:928>|chat<951:955>|chat<951:959>|multiple<965:973>|people<974:980>|skill<992:998>|give<1009:1013>|next<1018:1022>|next day<1018:1026>|day<1023:1026>|register<1037:1045>|warranty<1074:1082>|warranty replacement<1074:1094>|replacement<1083:1094>|kasa<1103:1107>|website<1108:1115>|indicate<1116:1125>|serial<1130:1136>|the serial number<1126:1144>|serial number<1130:1144>|number<1137:1144>|exist<1152:1157>|again<1164:1169>|chat<1176:1180>|chat support<1176:1188>|support<1181:1188>|minute<1192:1199>|give<1212:1218>|receipt<1235:1242>|pic<1247:1251>|serial<1259:1265>|serial number<1259:1273>|number<1266:1273>|the serial number<1255:1273>|all<1291:1294>|manually<1287:1295>|enter<1296:1301>|no response<1316:1328>|response<1319:1328>|warranty<1335:1343>|warranty replacement<1335:1355>|replacement<1344:1355>|almost<1357:1363>|hour<1366:1371>|3 hour<1364:1371>|chat<1375:1379>|support<1380:1387>|chat support<1375:1387>|all<1407:1410>|finally<1404:1411>|highly<1454:1460>|responsive<1461:1471>|google<1477:1483>|assistant<1484:1493>|google assistant<1477:1493>|sound<1532:1537>|turn<1547:1551>|turn<1547:1554>|all<1573:1576>|manually<1569:1577>|low<1586:1589>|cheap<1590:1595>|plastic<1596:1603>|sound<1604:1609>|tech<1663:1667>|support<1668:1675>|tech support<1663:1675>|encounter<1697:1708>|compare<1709:1717>|hue<1721:1724>|serial<1745:1751>|the serial number<1741:1759>|serial number<1745:1759>|number<1752:1759>|recognize<1770:1780>|all<1791:1794>|support<1803:1810>|again<1838:1843>",
      "Thick plastic base###thick<0:5>|plastic<6:13>|thick plastic<0:13>|base<14:18>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★☆☆ [2024-06-10] <b>Does not fit in multi-gang switch boxes</b> This does not fit easily (more on that later) when installing in a multi-gang (4 switches in my case) switch box because of the thick plastic base.  Standard switches are built on thinner metal bases and the face plates are designed to match that design. I have no idea why Kasa has decided to build their switches in a way that is not compatible with all standard switches.  Previous versions of the HS200 dimmable switch used a standard thin metal base for the switch, the current ones are build on a thick plastic base.  I was able to make the switch cover fit by using a Dremel tool on the back of the switch plate to lower the area where the switch plate screws mount to the switch.  That extra work should not have been necessary and Kasa should warn buyers that their switches are no usable without modification.###fit<12:15>|multi<19:24>|multi gang<19:29>|gang<25:29>|multi gang switch<19:36>|box<37:40>|box<37:42>|gang switch box<25:42>|fit<61:64>|easily<65:71>|later<86:91>|instal<98:108>|multi<114:119>|multi gang<114:124>|a multi gang<112:124>|gang<120:124>|case<143:147>|box<156:159>|thick<175:180>|thick plastic<175:188>|plastic<181:188>|base<189:193>|standard<196:204>|build<218:223>|thin<227:231>|thin<227:234>|metal<235:240>|base<241:245>|face<255:259>|plate<260:265>|the face plate<251:266>|plate<260:266>|face plate<255:266>|design<271:277>|design<271:279>|match<283:288>|design<294:300>|idea<312:316>|kasa<321:325>|decide<330:337>|build<341:346>|compatible<383:393>|standard<403:411>|previous<423:431>|version<432:440>|dimmable<454:462>|able<458:462>|standard<477:485>|thin<486:490>|metal<491:496>|base<497:501>|current<522:529>|one<530:534>|build<539:544>|thick<550:555>|thick plastic<550:563>|plastic<556:563>|base<564:568>|able<577:581>|cover<601:606>|fit<607:610>|tool<629:633>|back<641:645>|plate<660:665>|lower<669:674>|area<679:683>|plate<701:706>|screw<707:713>|mount<714:719>|extra<741:746>|necessary<773:782>|kasa<787:791>|warn<799:803>|buyer<804:810>|usable<838:844>|able<840:844>"

The ones I got (version 2.1) have the exact same thickness as other switches (see comparison photos with Lutron Diva dimmer.) They fit perfectly in my multi-gang decora switch box. As some reviews have mentioned, there IS a very faint squeaking sound when the switch is pressed... but I had to put my ear right next to it to hear it.

      "Smooth, flat, featureless plastic surface###smooth<0:6>|flat<8:12>|plastic<26:33>|surface<34:41>|||B08RSM1KYN ★☆☆☆☆ [2021-06-01] <b>Leviton needs to go back to the drawing board (review written by a technician)</b> A review is sometimes only as good as the experience of the person who is leaving it.  For this reason, I often ignore some reviews and give much more weight to others.  I will begin by saying that I have over 20 years experience as a computer technician and have a family full of people who work in trades (plumbing, heating, air conditioning, and electric) so my home network and my electrical system are in solid working order.  I have a wireless mesh network blanketing my property and there are no dead spots anywhere in my house.  Here is my review of this item:(1) Ergonomics.  Unlike other switches, this Leviton switch is a completely smooth, flat, featureless plastic surface.  It is impossible to reliably locate the on button in complete darkness - it is exactly the same as the off button.  While you can talk to it (and that has its own issues), the buttons should be easy to locate with your eyes closed and should be slightly illuminated so that you can see it but not be annoyed by it.(2) Connectivity.  As you will see in other reviews dating back to 2017, the devices bings and bongs, bleeps and beeps, randomly and annoyingly throughout the day and night.  It disconnects from the internet whenever it feels like it.  My wireless access points are not more than 20 feet away and not one of my 4 Leviton switches can maintain a solid connection.  The Tp-Link Kasa switch that is directly next to it has zero connectivity issues, and all my mobile devices have no issues with the home wifi.  Leviton's response to my email is that the wifi is getting affected by the fact that it is installed in a metal box with a metal cover.  \"Unfortunately, for wireless in-wall devices, metal wall boxes or metal wall plates typically attenuate the signal, so even if connected, it could be intermittent. While we recognize that it is difficult to change a metal wall box, if you can, we recommend using Leviton Decora wall plates.\"  If this is true, then why aren't the competitors' smart switches affected by the metal?  As you can see in my photo, the Tp-Link Kasa switch is right next to the Leviton switch and has never had any connectivity issues.(3) Lighting Performance.  To dim or brighten the lights, you must hold down the power on or off buttons.  It makes the job very imprecise.  In addition, every Leviton switch produces an audible hum over the internal speaker whenever the dimmer is used (I have halogen as well as LED bulb fixtures and it happens on all of them).  Maybe because it is so compact, Leviton needs to shield the internal speaker from the feedback of the dimmer.  I do not know why it happens but it happens on all four of mine.(4) Smart Home Performance.  Occasionally, I will tell Alexa to turn on the lights, she will say \"OK\", and nothing will happen.  I tell her to turn them off, she says \"OK\", and nothing happens.  I then have to completely reset the switch and join it to my Alexa network.  I have never had to do this with my Alexa Echo or my cheaper switches from Leviton's competitors.  Other times, I will send it a voice command and it will stutter and lock up.  When I try to use the switch to \"drop in\" on another Alexa device, it completely locks up the device and says \"Calling with Alexa is not supp...Calling with Alexa is not supp...Calling with Alexa is not supp...\" in a loop.  Leviton says it is a known bug.  Leviton has now informed me that using the switch to make a call is not supported, even though it has both a mic and a speaker and is connected to Alexa.  Um... why not?Bottom LineIf you expect this to be an Alexa Echo inside your wall, it is not and it probably never will be.  If you expect it to do its job as a dimmable light switch, it will do a poor job of it when compared to switches that are a quarter of the price.  If Amazon is your smart home platform of choice, buy an Alexa Echo for half the price of this switch and you will get all the features along with some decent quality speakers.  Then, buy your remaining switches from Tp-Link Kasa (pictured in the photo) or another capable manufacturer to round out your smart home purchase.  I had high hopes for these switches but they are all being returned after 2 months of struggling to make them work.###leviton<3:10>|back<23:27>|board<43:48>|write<57:64>|sometimes<98:107>|experience<128:138>|person<146:152>|leave<160:167>|reason<182:188>|often<192:197>|ignore<198:204>|give<222:226>|begin<263:268>|year<299:304>|experience<305:315>|computer<321:329>|family<352:358>|full<359:363>|people<367:373>|electric<435:443>|home<451:455>|network<456:463>|electric<471:479>|electrical<471:481>|system<482:488>|solid<496:501>|working<502:509>|wireless<527:535>|mesh<536:540>|network<541:548>|mesh

      "Flimsy faceplates###flimsy<0:6>|faceplate<7:17>|||B08RSM1KYN ★☆☆☆☆ [2025-02-02] <b>Do not buy this brand !!!</b> I have bought 3 sets of switches from Lutron and have used them for my two sons’ bedrooms and one for the garage.Since day one I could not get the settings to work. They do not turn on with motion sense with or without the ambient light sensor in my sons’ bedrooms.The garage switch stopped working for whatever reason. I tried to remove it from the panel and reinstall again but to no avail. I had to replace all the switches with Kasa and they work like butter as always.The build quality is pretty average. The faceplates of the switches are very flimsy. They groove to hold the faceplate has no locking mechanism.Impirtantly, the customer support is not up to par. I had reached out to the customer service and they stood by their product which is understandable. They got my address and mentioned that someone from their tech will reach out to me. It’s been almost a month. No avail. I am not expecting any replacements anymore but this brand is over hyped and they seem to be stuck in early innovators limbo###brand<19:24>|set<49:53>|lutron<71:77>|son<108:112>|bedroom<114:122>|garage<139:145>|day<152:155>|setting<180:188>|turn<210:214>|motion<223:229>|sense<230:235>|sensor<270:276>|son<283:287>|bedroom<289:297>|garage<302:308>|stop<316:323>|reason<345:351>|remove<364:370>|panel<383:388>|reinstall<393:402>|again<403:408>|no avail<416:424>|avail<419:424>|replace<435:442>|kasa<465:469>|always<499:505>|build<510:515>|build quality<510:523>|pretty<527:533>|average<534:541>|faceplate<547:556>|faceplate<547:557>|flimsy<583:589>|hold<606:610>|faceplate<615:624>|mechanism<640:649>|customer<667:675>|customer support<667:683>|support<676:683>|par<697:700>|reach<708:713>|reach<708:715>|customer<727:735>|customer service<727:743>|service<736:743>|the customer service<723:743>|stand<753:758>|address<813:820>|mention<825:834>|tech<859:863>|reach<869:874>|almost<896:902>|month<905:910>|no avail<912:920>|avail<915:920>|replace<945:952>|replacement<945:957>|anymore<958:965>|brand<975:980>|stick<1015:1020>|early<1024:1029>"

      "Minimal design###minimal<0:7>|design<8:14>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2021-01-03] <b>Great value, works well, but there are a couple of things to consider</b> This switch was my first step toward building a smart home, and the installation was straightforward and went as well as could be expected for an amateur like myself.  It works great with the Kasa App and plays nice with Google Home, IFTTT and Home Assistant.  I've worked it into a couple of automations and it's been responsive and worked as expected every step of the way.  It also has a good looking, minimal design.There are just 2 things keeping me from giving it a full 5 stars:  1. As others have said, it's quite large.  It took some doing to get it to fit into my switch box with all the wires that were already in there.  Doable, but it did try my patience a little bit.  2.  When the lights are off or dimmed, there's a VERY faint high pitch whine that comes from the switch.  I can't hear it unless I'm right up on the switch, but now that I've noticed it, I can't pretend it's not there.  It's super quiet, but definitely not silent.All said, it's a great bang for the buck and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.  I do wish TP-Link would release a 3-way version of this dimmer.  I'd rather keep the look consistent than buy another brand.###great value<3:14>|value<9:14>|a couple<42:50>|couple<44:50>|consider<64:72>|first<96:101>|step<102:106>|build<114:122>|smart<125:130>|smart home<125:135>|home<131:135>|a smart home<123:135>|installation<145:157>|straightforward<162:177>|kasa<269:273>|the kasa app<265:277>|kasa app<269:277>|play<282:287>|google<298:304>|google home<298:309>|home<305:309>|ifttt<311:316>|home<321:325>|assistant<326:335>|home assistant<321:335>|a couple<358:366>|couple<360:366>|automation<370:381>|responsive<396:406>|step<436:440>|looking<473:480>|minimal<482:489>|design<490:496>|keep<521:525>|keep<521:528>|give<537:543>|full<549:553>|5 star<554:561>|large<599:604>|fit<639:642>|box<658:661>|wire<675:680>|already<691:698>|dim<791:797>|faint<814:819>|high<820:824>|hear<874:878>|now<921:924>|notice<935:942>|super<985:990>|definitely<1002:1012>|buck<1060:1064>|again<1099:1104>|wish<1112:1116>|tp<1117:1119>|link<1120:1124>|tp link<1117:1124>|release<1131:1138>|3 way<1141:1146>|version<1147:1154>|dimmer<1163:1169>|keep<1183:1187>|consistent<1197:1207>|brand<1225:1230>|another brand<1217:1230>"

      "Self-grounding metal mounting flanges###self<0:4>|ground<5:14>|metal<15:20>|mount<21:29>|flange<30:37>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★★★ [2021-09-01] <b>Nice to see new models.  Looking forward to seeing how they perform.</b> I have many of the Gen 1 devices in my house.  Leviton has been my favorite brand for switches.  I also have tried Legrand and Aqara switches but always come back to Leviton as my fav.Pros:#1) 2.4GHz only:  I know a lot of people complain about this.  But I find this to be a benefit.  HomeKit does not need the bandwidth of 5GHz.  Most dual band mesh networks share a SSID and mine in particular (Orbi) cannot be separated.  My Gen 1 Decora Smart switches were constantly dropping with any WiFi interruption.  And these are the only HomeKit devices I have other than Apple TV and HomePods that are dual band devices.  I am looking forward to see how these new switches handle the same interruptions.#2) Self grounding:  The metal mounting flanges are self-grounding to metal switch boxes with grounded conduit.  This eliminates the need to use the ground wire.  I liked this about Gen 1 and am happy to see this also on the Gen 2.  Other brands use plastic mounting flanges that require the use of the ground wire.#3) It has both wireless and wired options for 3 way connections.  If you have a Gen 1 switch installed in a 3-way set up with a DD0SR coordinated remote this is a drop in replacement.  And now it gives you the option to use a wireless remote as well.Cons:#1) Setup:  The setup didn’t seem to go as smoothly as the Gen 1.  I attempted to add directly to Home App multiple times.  I reset the switch, restarted my phone, but could never “connect” to the switch when adding accessory.  I ended up having to add to the new Leviton app first, and then add to HomeKit via the Home app.  I also bought the new Gen 2 dimmer wall plug and had same experience.  I am not sure if it’s my system or the new device, but it wasn’t the experience I’m used to.#2) Wire Leads:  The Gen 1 had screw connections.  This is by far a better way to install IMO.  The leads and wire nuts take too much space.###new<15:18>|model<19:25>|forward<36:43>|perform<63:70>|gen<95:98>|device<101:107>|device<101:108>|house<115:120>|leviton<123:130>|favorite<143:151>|brand<152:157>|always<222:228>|back<234:238>|leviton<242:249>|now<286:289>|people<299:305>|lot of people<292:305>|complain<306:314>|find<334:338>|benefit<352:359>|home<362:366>|homekit<362:369>|band<388:392>|bandwidth<388:397>|most<408:412>|dual<413:417>|band<418:422>|mesh<423:427>|mesh network<423:436>|network<428:436>|share<437:442>|ssid<445:449>|particular<462:472>|orbi<474:478>|separate<490:499>|gen<505:508>|decora<511:517>|decora smart<511:523>|smart<518:523>|decora smart switch<511:532>|constantly<538:548>|drop<549:553>|drop<549:557>|wifi<567:571>|interruption<572:584>|home<610:614>|homekit<610:617>|device<618:624>|device<618:625>|apple<644:649>|tv<650:652>|home<657:661>|dual<675:679>|band<680:684>|device<685:691>|device<685:692>|forward<708:715>|new<733:736>|handle<746:752>|same<757:761>|interruption<762:774>|self<780:784>|ground<785:791>|ground<785:794>|metal<801:806>|mount<807:815>|flange<816:823>|self<828:832>|ground<833:839>|ground<833:842>|metal<846:851>|box<859:864>|ground<870:876>|ground<870:878>|eliminate<894:904>|ground<925:931>|ground wire<925:936>|wire<932:936>|gen<958:961>|happy<971:976>|gen<1001:1004>|brand<1015:1020>|brand<1015:1021>|other brand<1009:1021>|plastic<1026:1033>|mount<1034:1042>|flange<1043:1050>|require<1056:1063>|ground<1079:1085>|ground wire<1079:1090>|wire<1086:1090>|wire<1107:1111>|wireless<1107:1115>|wire<1120:1124>|wired<1120:1125>|option<1126:1132>|option<1126:1133>|3 way<1138:1143>|connect<1144:1151>|connection<1144:1155>|gen<1172:1175>|install<1185:1192>|instal<1185:1194>|3 way<1200:1205>|set<1206:1209>|remote<1238:1244>|drop<1255:1259>|replacement<1263:1274>|now<1281:1284>|give<1288:1293>|option<1302:1308>|wire<1318:1322>|wireless<1318:1326>|remote<1327:1333>|setup<1351:1356>|set<1363:1366>|setup<1363:1368>|smoothly<1390:1398>|gen<1406:1409>|attempt<1416:1425>|add<1429:1432>|directly<1433:1441>|home<1445:1449>|multiple<1454:1462>|multiple time<1454:1468>|reset<1473:1478>|set<1475:1478>|restart<1491:1500>|phone<1504:1509>|never<1521:1526>|connect<1528:1535>|add<1556:1559>|add<1556:1562>|accessory<1563:1572>|end<1577:1582>|add<1596:1599>|new<1607:1610>|leviton<1611:1618>|leviton app<1611:1622>|first<1623:1628>|add<1639:1642>|home<1646:1650>|homekit<1646:1653>|home<1662:1666>|new<1691:1694>|gen<1695:1698>|dimmer<1701:1707>|wall<1708:1712>|plug<1713:1717>|same<1726:1730>|experience<1731:1741>|system<1769:1775>|new<1783:1786>|device<1787:1793>|experience<1813:1823>|wire<1840:1844>|lead<1845:1850>|gen<1857:1860>|screw<1867:1872>|connect<1873:1880>|connection<1873:1884>|far<1898:1901>|install<1918:1925>|lead<1936:1941>|wire<1946:1950>|nut<1951:1955>|wire nut<1946:1955>|space<1970:1975>",

In my case I had the Dimmable Canless recessed LEDs by Commerical Electric(homedepot brand). These switches only were able to dim my lights to around 70%~, messing around with the dimming configurations did not help. Other smart switches ive tried worked. I currently have Caseta by Lutron, only down side of lutron is the price and that it has no dimmer memory unless you buy their $100 model.- their customer service is terrible do not even bother contacting, you will waste your time.###pro<8:12>|one<17:20>|big<21:24>|con<25:28>|pro<33:37>|hub<43:46>|no hub<40:46>|require<47:55>|board<90:95>|remember<115:123>|last<128:132>|dim<133:136>|set<140:147>|location<199:207>|dim<212:215>|dimmer<212:218>|button<219:226>|accidentally<240:252>|hit<253:256>|turn<277:281>|last<322:326>|plastic<321:328>|con<341:344>|connect<341:350>|amazon alexa<356:368>|alexa<363:368>|away<375:379>|easy<381:385>|con<391:394>|one<403:406>|deal<413:417>|a deal breaker<411:425>|breaker<418:425>|deal breaker<413:425>|dim<460:463>|certain<469:476>|type<477:482>|led<486:490>|case<498:502>|dimmable<513:521>|able<517:521>|recess<530:538>|led<539:543>|brand<577:582>|able<610:614>|dim<618:621>|mess<648:655>|dim<672:675>|dim<672:679>|configuration<680:694>|help<703:707>|smart<715:720>|other smart switch<709:729>|currently<750:759>|caseta<765:771>|lutron<775:781>|side<793:797>|lutron<801:807>|price<815:820>|dim<840:843>|dimmer<840:846>|customer<894:902>|service<903:910>|customer service<894:910>|bother<935:941>|contact<942:952>|waste<963:968>",
      "Uses compression style crimps on the sides###style<17:22>|side<37:42>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★★☆ [2023-11-28] <b>Amazing, almost perfect</b> This is fantastic concept and clears up so much space for areas where you don't want a bulky smart plug connected. We're personally using it in our kitchen near the end of the counter. The bottom plug is for the always on coffee machine and the top plug (the smart outlet section) is for the Christmas season when we run Christmas Lights up on top of the cabinet. It's perfectly located to allow us to run a flat plugged extension chord up to the top of the cabinets between the wall and the open gap from the cabinet.The outlet itself was very easy to install...like a typical receptacle and I love that it uses the compression style crimps on the sides of the receptacle where you don't need to \"hook/loop\" the conductor cables. It's the standard size for GFCI receptacle so it fits just fine into the box. The reactive speed when using Apples Homekit to turn it on and off is near instant, and the button in the middle for manual control of the top section is easy to use.There are only a few things I wish I could change about this receptacle:1) Make it so both Plugs can be controlled, not just the top half.2) Use a quieter relay...The contactor is LOUD when it turns on/off....almost comically loud....I'm honestly surprised Leviton was okay with this.3) Thread connectivity would also be fantastic to have built into these receptacles to help strengthen the connection for multiple receptacles and other devices using the Thread protocol.If all 3 of my changes could be incorporated. I would throw money at this product in a very irrespirable way. There's nothing else out on the market like this...the closest you'll get is a smart power strip (which obviously has it's own advantages/disadvantages compared to it all being built into a receptacle in the wall.)The price point is a little high for what is described above. I picked this up on sale for about 20% off and I'd say it's worth that....but with overall cost compared to what you get compared to getting a smart plug or a smart power strip, you'd likely be better off going that route. Unless like me, you wanted a specific use-case where not having a large brick hanging out of the wall would be more preferable then this thing is awesome. It looks incredibly clean, it's super responsive, and unfortunately it's also super loud (Which I guess is a good way to make sure it's working?)4/5 for what it is....5/5 if they include those three updates I'm looking for. Great product.###almost<12:18>|concept<49:56>|clear<61:67>|space<79:84>|area<89:94>|bulky<118:123>|smart<124:129>|smart plug<124:134>|plug<130:134>|connect<135:144>|personally<152:162>|kitchen<179:186>|end<196:199>|counter<207:214>|bottom<220:226>|plug<227:231>|always<243:249>|coffee<253:259>|machine<260:267>|top<276:279>|plug<280:284>|smart<290:295>|outlet<296:302>|christmas<323:332>|run<348:351>|christmas<352:361>|lights<362:368>|top<375:378>|cabinet<386:393>|perfectly<400:409>|locate<410:417>|allow<421:426>|run<433:436>|flat<439:443>|plug<444:448>|plug<444:451>|extension<452:461>|top<478:481>|cabinet<489:496>|cabinet<489:497>|wall<510:514>|open<523:527>|gap<528:531>|cabinet<541:548>|outlet<553:559>|easy<576:580>|install<584:591>|typical<601:608>|receptacle<609:619>|love<626:630>|style<660:665>|side<680:685>|receptacle<693:703>|hook<729:733>|loop<734:738>|cable<754:760>|standard<771:779>|size<780:784>|gfci<789:793>|receptacle<794:804>|fit<811:815>|box<835:838>|speed<853:858>|homekit<877:884>|turn<888:892>|instant<915:922>|button<932:938>|middle<946:952>|the middle<942:952>|manual<957:963>|manual control<957:971>|control<964:971>|top<979:982>|easy<994:998>|wish<1036:1040>|change<1049:1055>|receptacle<1067:1077>|plug<1097:1102>|control<1110:1117>|control<1110:1120>|top<1135:1138>|relay<1161:1166>|loud<1186:1190>|turn<1199:1203>|turn<1199:1204>|almost<1215:1221>|loud<1232:1236>|honestly<1244:1252>|surprise<1253:1262>|leviton<1263:1270>|thread<1293:1299>|connectivity<1300:1312>|build<1345:1350>|receptacle<1362:1372>|receptacle<1362:1373>|help<1377:1381>|connection<1397:1407>|multiple<1412:1420>|receptacle<1421:1431>|receptacle<1421:1432>|device<1443:1450>|thread<1461:1467>|protocol<1468:1476>|change<1492:1498>|change<1492:1499>|throw<1531:1536>|money<1537:1542>|market<1619:1625>|the market<1615:1625>|close<1642:1649>|smart<1666:1671>|power<1672:1677>|power strip<1672:1683>|strip<1678:1683>|obviously<1691:1700>|own<1710:1713>|compare<1739:1747>|build<1764:1769>|receptacle<1777:1787>|wall<1795:1799>|price<1805:1810>|price point<1805:1816>|point<1811:1816>|high<1829:1833>|describe<1846:1855>|pick<1865:1871>|sale<1883:1887>|worth<1923:1928>|overall<1946:1953>|cost<1954:1958>|compare<1959:1967>|compare<1984:1992>|smart<2006:2011>|plug<2012:2016>|smart plug<2006:2016>|smart<2022:2027>|power<2028:2033>|power strip<2028:2039>|strip<2034:2039>|likely<2047:2053>|specific<2115:2123>|use case<2124:2132>|case<2128:2132>|large<2152:2157>|wall<2183:2187>|incredibly<2250:2260>|clean<2261:2266>|super<2273:2278>|responsive<2279:2289>|unfortunately<2295:2308>|super<2319:2324>|loud<2325:2329>|guess<2339:2344>|include<2420:2427>|update<2440:2447>"

Requires app for install and updates.</b> These are smart / WiFi dimmers that are hard-wired into a junction box for switched lights.Only supports 2.4 Ghz WifI band -- some of the hardware variants used in individual dimmers will stay connected indefinitely and some will disconnect and reconnect randomly and as frequently every few minutes.  It apparently has to do with the WiFi chips, firmware, or both.Sometimes the brightness level LEDs on the top if the dimmer will get stuck and stay on and at other times, they turn off after a few seconds.Alexa integration is OK for basic functions, but gets complicated rapidly as the number of named devices increases. You will need to come up with creative names if, for example, you have more than one dimmer per named room and then you will have to remember which are which. There is no alexa integration for calibration. firmware updates, or time or time zone adjustments.These dimmers work for most light sources:  incandescent (but wattage is limited to 200) and some dimmable fluorescent and some LED bulbs.Requires an app for initial installation, dimmer calibration, and for firmware or time updates.There is no easy reference source on the product page for bulb compatibility, so be sure you test your bulbs before going to the trouble to install these dimmers.Worked poorly on Feit LED candelabra bulbs: there was noticeable bulb flickering at dimming levels below 60 percent.Single pole (one switch) only.  Requires a neutral and ground connection, so there will be four wire connections per dimmer (green, white, and two for the controlled device).  Oddly, the green and white connections require wire nuts but the line and load are screwed into the side of the dimmer.Large back cover uses a lot of space in the junction box, so not the best choice for small or crowded junction boxes.The front up and down controls are too small and should be bigger.The indicator LED bulb is very dim and cannot be seen in a bright room.  A dimmable indicator on a dimmer would have been be a logical design choice, but it's not available on this model.There still is no web interface for these smart dimmers -- only app controls.  The Apple app does not support accessibility options and is not suitable for those with vision issues -- moreover, the contrast and size on the app screens is very poor even for those with good vision -- especially if your Apple device uses adaptive backlighting.There is a removable, screwless faceplate which is a nice feature. The face plate and switch front are a high gloss finish that shows fingerprints and scratches; a matte finish would be much better.There are two very small, unmarked and hard-to-access switches built into the dimmer bottom.  One reboots the dimmer without removing the programming and account information. The other wipes the device and removes it from an account.For those who prefer a flawless installation, be sure that the dimmer is not angled when you screw it into the junction box.  If there is any angle, the face plate will not fit flush with the dimmer. This is especially important if there are more than one switch or dimmer in a junction box.###design<16:22>|web<30:33>|interface<34:43>|face<39:43>|require<45:53>|install<62:69>|update<74:81>|smart<97:102>|wifi<105:109>|dim<110:113>|dimmer<110:116>|dimmer<110:117>|hard<127:131>|wire<132:136>|wire<132:137>|junction<145:153>|box<154:157>|junction

      "Bright shiny finish on switches and covers###bright<0:6>|finish<13:19>|cover<36:42>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2019-03-08] <b>Great switch, needs more smart actions</b> I installed 25 tp-link switches (combination of dimmer, switch, and 3 way switch) in my home, and one wemo dimmer.Installation: The tp-link dimmers and switches have different attachment hardware (where you screw the switch to attach it to the electric box in the wall). This is annoying because the switches have a thick plastic, while the dimmers are metal but have a piece of plastic that screws onto the top of the front which has to be removed. I personally prefer the dimmer metal hardware. When you install a dimmer next to a switch you have to really fiddle with them to make the two different sizes look the same after the cover is on.What I like:I really like the fact that I can control these from the switch, my phone, or the from google assistant.I also have a in wall wemo dimmer. When I tell google to turn off or on the lights the wemo is significantly slower to respond then the tp-link. For tp-link the lights start to turn on//off in probably .5 sec while the wemo dimmer may take 2-8 seconds to start to respond.Look - the switches and the covers have a bright shiny finish. In most cases I was not able to use the included cover as they are installed in double or triple switch settings, but I like them where I was able to use them.Light compatibility - I've installed these with multiple kinds of dimmable LED lights and they have all functioned well.Light range - I replaced my living room light which originally had the wemo dimmer switch  and I noticed that the tp-link uses a greater range of the light bulb - i.e. it dims more and 100% brightness is brigher which I like.These also pretty quickly reconnect to wifi after I flip the breaker off or power outage (unlike some of my other smart devices that I have to setup over an over again with every power blip)Enhancements I would really like:Enabling third party triggers. I use IFTTT to integrate multiple smart things together. While these dimmers are compatible with IFTTT - they are only able to be used as THAT devices (in the \"if this than that\"(ifttt) recipes). So for example, with my wemo switch, if I wanted to turn on/off some other smart device when I clicked the wemo dimmer switch, I could use the wemo click as a THIS action or trigger. But these switches I can only use to respond to other actions, for example, when my door sensor senses that the door opened I can turn on the entry way light.True Instant on/off: The dimmer switches have a setting where you can change how fast they dim on and off when you click the switch. One option is \"Instant\". When I have it set to instant, it really just dims on/off fast. I have a non dimmer switch right next to a dimmer switch and when I click both at the same time the dimmer light takes longer, probably a second to turn on, while the non-dimmable switch is instant. This would also probably help with non-dimmable lights. I had non-dimmable lights attached to some of my dimmers and these acted very poorly even when set to instant on. They really buzzed and some even continued to buzz loudly while on.Always on circle  light in switch - In places where I have three dimmers together, when I turn one light on, that switches circle on the switch turns off. When I go to turn the light off I instantly think that the switches with the light on are the ones that are on, so I click those two only to find that neither of those lights were on and end up cycling through all three switches.In the kasa app when you select a dimmer or a switch the UI is completely different, it would be nice for them to be more similar.What I don't like -The click. About 1 out of every 4 times that I click the switch it doesn't turn on/off. Probably similar to learning to double click on a computer mouse for the first time (for those that can remember that). This could also probably be resolved with the instant on/off I mentioned before. Because it takes about a second even on instant on for the light to come to full power, when you click on and didn't click hard enough you end up walking past the switch thinking it is just takings its second to dim on, but then you have to walk back to the switch once it actually doesn't work. Some of my switches also have a bit of a squeaky click, which is also annoying.Note about 3-way switches - Even though my house was built fairly recently, for every set of three way switches, only one of the two wall wirings has the white wire. Luckily these can be paired with an old dumb three way switch and work quite well (i.e. you can use a single 2 pack of 3-way switches for two separate sets of 3-way sockets)Note about wifi - I have mesh wifi in a smallish house so my wifi coverage is good throughout and wifi connectivity has not been an issue for switches.Update Feb 2020:Smart actions - Auto off action. I really like this feature. I have my bathroom vent fans set to auto off after 15 minutes, and I think it has always worked except for one time my WiFi was down. The problem, your only allowed 3 smart actions. I’d love to be able to set more. My son uses the bathroom at the far end of my house and leaves the light on every time. A 15 minute auto off would be perfect. It would also work for closet and hallway lights. TP-link please add more smart actions.###smart<28:33>|action<34:40>|action<34:41>|smart action<28:41>|install<48:55>|all<52:55>|instal<48:57>|tp<61:63>|link<64:68>|tp link<61:68>|tp link

      "Color mismatch with Leviton white###color<0:5>|leviton<20:27>|white<28:33>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2022-06-07] <b>somewhat easy to install, doesnt match white</b> Does NOT match Leviton white completely, but close enough you're the only one to notice. If it bothers you, I'd try Leviton's own smart dimmers and switches, but they cost more than twice as much as what Kasas cost. App and Alexa integration is pretty easy to setup. Smart light bulbs requires you to turn the switch on all the time if you want to use voice commands or have a smart switch w/o dimmer with it. At that point it gets complicated. It is fairly bulky. I installed one in a bathroom in the same box as an exhaust fan timer/humidity sensor and an outlet tied in. Took me awhile, but it fits. Forced my wires back quite a lot to knock a neutral loose. Luckily it didn't short anything out, so double check your work.###easy<12:16>|install<20:27>|match<36:41>|white<42:47>|match<61:66>|leviton<67:74>|white<75:80>|completely<81:91>|close<97:102>|notice<133:139>|bother<147:154>|leviton<168:175>|own<178:181>|smart<182:187>|dimmer<188:194>|dimmer<188:195>|smart dimmer<182:195>|cost<219:223>|twice<234:239>|kasa<256:261>|cost<262:266>|alexa<276:281>|integration<282:293>|alexa integration<276:293>|pretty<297:303>|easy<304:308>|setup<312:317>|smart<319:324>|bulb<331:336>|require<337:345>|turn<353:357>|voice<404:409>|command<410:418>|voice command<404:418>|smart<429:434>|dimmer<446:452>|point<470:475>|complicated<484:495>|fairly<503:509>|bulky<510:515>|install<519:526>|instal<519:528>|bathroom<538:546>|same<554:558>|the same box<550:562>|box<559:562>|exhaust<569:576>|fan<577:580>|timer<581:586>|sensor<596:602>|outlet<610:616>|tie<617:621>|awhile<634:640>|fit<649:653>|force<655:661>|wire<665:670>|knock<691:696>|neutral<699:706>|loose<707:712>|short<732:737>|double<755:761>|check<762:767>",

A little disappointing.</b> At this price point, it's hard to argue against this switch.  It will listen to your voice assistant and give you the dimmed settings you want.  My complaints are not enough to justify giving this more than one star off, but they are a little annoying.First is that the switch is a little slow to respond to regular operation (touching the switch itself).  It takes maybe a second for the lights to turn on.Second, the dimming stages are a little rough.  It gets about halfway up, pauses, then goes full brightness.  It's not my bulbs, either, these are brand-new, dimmable LEDs from a reputable manufacturer.Third, the switch is only available in white.  I realize that an alternate almond/ivory plate is probably more in the realm of much more expensive products (and a little wasteful to include only as a contingency alternative), but other brands offer replaceable faceplates that match your installed switches.Fourth, the included faceplate only goes on well if your wall and electrical box are well done.  This is probably more a knock on the contractor who installed the boxes in the room where I used this, but even so.  Many contractors don't bother with making boxes anything other than functional.  I had to buy a separate faceplate to make it work.Overall, though, combined with an inexpensive pack of bulbs, it's hard to argue against this price point.  Certainly beats putting smart bulbs everywhere in a situation where you have to control a large number of lights.###mostly<3:9>|job<19:22>|point<39:44>|disappointing<34:47>|price<61:66>|point<67:72>|price point<61:72>|hard<79:83>|listen<123:129>|voice<138:143>|assistant<144:153>|voice assistant<138:153>|give<158:162>|dim<171:177>|setting<178:186>|complaint<201:211>|give<238:244>|one star<260:268>|annoying<296:304>|first<305:310>|slow<342:346>|respond<350:357>|regular<361:368>|operation<369:378>|touch<380:388>|second<427:433>|turn<452:456>|second<460:466>|dim<472:479>|full<552:556>|full brightness<552:567>|brightness<557:567>|bulb<582:587>|either<589:595>|brand<607:612>|new<613:616>|dimmable<618:626>|dimmable led<618:631>|led<627:631>|manufacturer<649:661>|third<662:667>|available<688:697>|white<701:706>|realize<711:718>|almond<737:743>|plate<750:755>|probably<759:767>|expensive<799:808>|include<844:851>|alternative<874:885>|brand<898:903>|other brand<892:904>|brand<898:904>|offer<905:910>|plate<927:932>|faceplate<923:932>|faceplate<923:933>|match<939:944>|instal<950:959>|include<981:988>|include<981:989>|faceplate<990:999>|plate<994:999>|wall<1026:1030>|electrical<1035:1045>|electrical box<1035:1049>|box<1046:1049>|probably<1074:1082>|knock<1090:1095>|contractor<1103:1113>|instal<1118:1127>|box<1132:1135>|box<1132:1137>|room<1145:1149>|contractor<1188:1198>|contractor<1188:1199>|bother<1206:1212>|box<1225:1228>|box<1225:1230>|functional<1251:1261>|separate<1279:1287>|faceplate<1288:1297>|plate<1292:1297>|overall<1314:1321>|though<1323:1329>|combine<1331:1339>|expensive<1350:1359>|inexpensive<1348:1359>|pack<1360:1364>|bulb<1368:1373>|hard<1380:1384>|price<1407:1412>|point<1413:1418>|price point<1407:1418>|certainly<1421:1430>|put<1437:1444>|smart<1445:1450>|bulb<1451:1456>|everywhere<1457:1467>|situation<1473:1482>|control<1501:1508>|large<1511:1516>|number<1517:1523>"

We freakin love these things. over the last 4+ years of owning our home we have swapped out almost every single light switch in our house with these Kasa Switches.Models we have:Kasa Smart Light Switch HS200P3 - Your standard light switchKasa Smart Dimmer Switch KS220P3 - This is your standard dimmer switchKasa Smart 3 Way Switch HS210  - 3 way switchWe are a Google family with the exception of our 12 year old daughter how has yet to see the light but we are working on it. These switches are all hooked up to Google Home so we can either get off the couch and flick the switch like an animal or we can simply say: Hey Google, Turn off the kitchen lights. we have everything grouped in Google Home by room and function of the switch which make it a breeze for even my kids to use. My wife is British and to be fair she does struggle with it understanding her from time to time but I do not encounter that problem so I am giving these bad boys 5 stars. They are a modern bright white that matches our home, the install was so easy that even a colorblind adult (me) could do it, initial setup is very easy but if you do change your wifi name and network details you will need to reconfigure them which can be a bit of a pain in the buttocks. We have only had to do this once and I do not recommend it. We like these so much we have even purchased them as a house warming gift for my ungrateful brother and he is also now hooked on the smart tech they offer. I recommend these and will certainly be buying more in the future.###affordable<13:23>|life<28:32>|change<33:41>|love<98:102>|last<126:130>|year<134:138>|year<134:139>|4 year<131:139>|own<143:149>|home<154:158>|swap<167:174>|almost<179:185>|single<192:198>|house<219:224>|kasa<236:240>|switches<241:249>|model<250:256>|kasa<265:269>|kasa smart<265:275>|smart<270:275>|standard<304:312>|kasa<325:329>|smart<330:335>|kasa smart<325:335>|smart dimmer<330:342>|dimmer<336:342>|smart dimmer switch<330:349>|standard<373:381>|dimmer<382:388>|kasa<395:399>|smart<400:405>|kasa smart<395:405>|3 way<406:411>|3 way switch<406:418>|3 way<428:433>|google<449:455>|family<456:462>|exception<472:481>|year<492:496>|old<497:500>|daughter<501:509>|yet<518:521>|all<584:587>|hook<588:594>|google<601:607>|home<608:612>|google home<601:612>|either<623:629>|flick<652:657>|simply<694:700>|google<710:716>|turn<718:722>|kitchen<731:738>|kitchen light<731:745>|group<766:773>|google<777:783>|home<784:788>|google home<777:788>|room<792:796>|function<801:809>|a breeze<838:846>|breeze<840:846>|kid<859:863>|wife<875:879>|fair<901:905>|struggle<915:923>|understand<932:945>|encounter<981:990>|problem<996:1003>|give<1012:1018>|5 star<1034:1041>|modern<1054:1060>|bright<1061:1067>|white<1068:1073>|match<1079:1086>|home<1091:1095>|all<1105:1108>|install<1101:1108>|easy<1116:1120>|initial<1168:1175>|setup<1176:1181>|easy<1190:1194>|change<1209:1215>|wifi<1221:1225>|name<1226:1230>|network<1235:1242>|detail<1243:1250>|reconfigure<1268:1279>|a pain<1307:1313>|pain<1309:1313>|once<1359:1363>|recommend<1377:1386>|house<1446:1451>|now<1506:1509>|hook<1510:1516>|smart<1524:1529>|tech<1530:1534>|offer<1540:1545>|recommend<1549:1558>|certainly<1574:1583>|future<1606:1612>",

      "Deep switch###deep<0:4>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2023-09-23] <b>Installation relatively easy, beware of the DEEP switch! Need a Leviton switch plate cover.</b> Interesting installation:  Two of the wires (ground, neutral) are fastened to existing wires in the switch box with wire nuts.  But line and load wires need to be attached to the switch with screw terminals..Since my old switch had the wires attached to the switch with push-wire installation, I had to remove the wires from the old switch, then bend the wires into a little “C” shape to install them onto the TP Link’s screw terminals, then fasten those down.  This made the installation a bit more tedious, but it does save a bit of room in the switch box (as the wire nuts can be bulky and take up a bit of room).After some effort was able to fit the switch into the switch box, but it was quite a tight fit. This is a thick switch.  Screwed it in (it’s in a 2-gang switch box with another decora/decorator-type switch that controls the bathroom fan) and tried to put on the Legrand 2-gang decorator switch plate, but the bottom of the plate would not cover the TP Links switch fully.  There was a little annoying gap at the bottom, even with the switch plate fully fastened.I bought another 2-gang switch plate (by Leviton) and this was a midway switch which was a bit deeper.. thankfully this fit perfectly!  So keep that in mind.. if you don’t use the included switch plate cover by TP Link, you’ll need a deeper, thicker switch plate cover to accommodate this thick switch.  Leviton’s midway plate worked well for this.Now that the switch is installed it works great.  Installed via the TP Link Kasa app, connected to Alexa and added to Home Assistant.  The dimmer functionality works well and the switch looks nice.  I am not sure how I like the switch feel when using the switch manually, though. It feels a little odd (not like a “real” click from a mechanical switch).  Most of the time I use sensors and timers to turn the switch on/off, so not a big deal, but the physical switch itself doesn’t feel 100% like a real manual/mechanical switch.Overall I like it.  It’s a great value for the price (less than $20) and it is UL listed, which was an important requirement for me.###installation<3:15>|relatively<16:26>|easy<27:31>|beware<33:39>|deep<47:51>|leviton<67:74>|plate<82:87>|plate cover<82:93>|cover<88:93>|install<111:118>|installation<111:123>|wire<137:141>|wire<137:142>|ground<144:150>|neutral<152:159>|exist<177:185>|wire<186:190>|wire<186:191>|box<206:209>|wire<215:219>|wire nut<215:224>|nut<220:224>|line<231:235>|load<240:244>|wire<245:249>|wire<245:250>|load wire<240:250>|attach<262:270>|screw<290:295>|screw terminal<290:305>|terminal<296:305>|old<316:319>|wire<335:339>|wire<335:340>|attach<341:349>|push<369:373>|wire<374:378>|install<379:386>|installation<379:391>|remove<402:408>|wire<413:417>|wire<413:418>|old<428:431>|wire<454:458>|wire<454:459>|install<487:494>|tp<509:511>|tp link<509:516>|the tp link<505:516>|link<512:516>|screw<519:524>|screw terminal<519:534>|terminal<525:534>|install<575:582>|installation<575:587>|save<620:624>|room<634:638>|box<653:656>|wire<665:669>|wire nut<665:674>|nut<670:674>|bulky<682:687>|room<709:713>|effort<726:732>|able<737:741>|fit<745:748>|box<776:779>|tight<800:805>|a tight fit<798:809>|tight fit<800:809>|fit<806:809>|thick<821:826>|screw<836:843>|gang<863:867>|2 gang<861:867>|box<875:878>|gang switch box<863:878>|decora<892:898>|decora<899:905>|type<909:913>|control<926:934>|bathroom<939:947>|room<943:947>|fan<948:951>|bathroom fan<939:951>|put<966:969>|2 gang<985:991>|gang<987:991>|decora<992:998>|plate<1009:1014>|bottom<1024:1030>|plate<1038:1043>|cover<1054:1059>|tp<1064:1066>|link<1067:1071>|the tp link<1060:1071>|tp link<1064:1071>|the tp link<1060:1072>|link<1067:1072>|tp link<1064:1072>|fully<1080:1085>|annoying<1107:1115>|gap<1116:1119>|bottom<1127:1133>|plate<1156:1161>|fully<1162:1167>|gang<1196:1200>|2 gang<1194:1200>|plate<1208:1213>|leviton<1218:1225>|deep<1272:1278>|fully<1286:1291>|thankfully<1281:1291>|fit<1297:1300>|perfectly<1301:1310>|keep<1316:1320>|mind<1329:1333>|include<1357:1365>|plate<1373:1378>|cover<1379:1384>|plate cover<1373:1384>|tp<1388:1390>|link<1391:1395>|tp link<1388:1395>|deep<1411:1417>|thick<1419:1424>|thick<1419:1426>|plate<1434:1439>|cover<1440:1445>|plate cover<1434:1445>|thick<1466:1471>|leviton<1481:1488>|plate<1498:1503>|now<1525:1528>|install<1548:1555>|instal<1548:1557>|instal<1575:1584>|tp<1593:1595>|link<1596:1600>|the tp link<1589:1600>|tp link<1593:1600>|kasa<1601:1605>|link kasa<1596:1605>|tp link kasa<1593:1605>|kasa app<1601:1609>|connect<1611:1620>|alexa<1624:1629>|add<1634:1639>|home<1643:1647>|home assistant<1643:1657>|assistant<1648:1657>|dimmer<1664:1670>|functionality<1671:1684>|feel<1760:1764>|manual<1787:1793>|manually<1787:1795>|though<1797:1803>|feel<1808:1812>|feel<1808:1813>|odd<1823:1826>|real<1840:1844>|click<1846:1851>|mechanical<1859:1869>|most<1880:1884>|sensor<1903:1910>|timer<1915:1921>|turn<1925:1929>|big<1958:1961>|big deal<1958:1966>|deal<1962:1966>|a big deal<1956:1966>|physical<1976:1984>|physical switch<1976:1991>|feel<2007:2011>|real<2024:2028>|manual<2029:2035>|mechanical<2036:2046>|overall<2054:2061>|great value<2081:2092>|value<2087:2092>|price<2101:2106>|less<2108:2112>|ul<2133:2135>|list<2136:2142>|important<2157:2166>|requirement<2167:2178>",

They would be fine for a day and disconnect for a few days and then start working properly after that. Restarting and reconfiguring didn't help, either. * Might be a little too wide for SOME older outlet/switch boxes. Especially installing 2 or more smart switches in one multi-gang box.THE PROS: * The price for a name brand switch. * Blends in with similar looking manual rocker switches. * Set-up was very easy.###noticeable<52:62>|a noticeable delay<50:68>|noticeable delay<52:68>|delay<63:68>|turn<74:81>|set<96:99>|instant<104:111>|annoying<131:139>|soon<166:170>|install<177:184>|network<196:203>|issue<204:210>|day<237:240>|disconnect<245:255>|day<266:269>|a few day<260:270>|day<266:270>|few day<262:270>|start<280:285>|properly<294:302>|start<317:322>|restart<315:325>|help<351:355>|either<357:363>|wide<389:393>|old<403:408>|outlet<409:415>|box<423:426>|box<423:428>|especially<430:440>|install<441:448>|instal<441:451>|smart<462:467>|multi<484:489>|gang<490:494>|gang box<490:498>|multi gang box<484:498>|box<495:498>|price<515:520>|name<527:531>|brand<532:537>|name brand<527:537>|similar<563:570>|manual<579:585>|rocker<586:592>|rocker switch<586:601>|set<605:608>|set up<605:611>|easy<621:625>",
      "Compact size###compact<0:7>|size<8:12>|||B08RSM1KYN ★☆☆☆☆ [2021-06-01] <b>Leviton needs to go back to the drawing board (review written by a technician)</b> A review is sometimes only as good as the experience of the person who is leaving it.  For this reason, I often ignore some reviews and give much more weight to others.  I will begin by saying that I have over 20 years experience as a computer technician and have a family full of people who work in trades (plumbing, heating, air conditioning, and electric) so my home network and my electrical system are in solid working order.  I have a wireless mesh network blanketing my property and there are no dead spots anywhere in my house.  Here is my review of this item:(1) Ergonomics.  Unlike other switches, this Leviton switch is a completely smooth, flat, featureless plastic surface.  It is impossible to reliably locate the on button in complete darkness - it is exactly the same as the off button.  While you can talk to it (and that has its own issues), the buttons should be easy to locate with your eyes closed and should be slightly illuminated so that you can see it but not be annoyed by it.(2) Connectivity.  As you will see in other reviews dating back to 2017, the devices bings and bongs, bleeps and beeps, randomly and annoyingly throughout the day and night.  It disconnects from the internet whenever it feels like it.  My wireless access points are not more than 20 feet away and not one of my 4 Leviton switches can maintain a solid connection.  The Tp-Link Kasa switch that is directly next to it has zero connectivity issues, and all my mobile devices have no issues with the home wifi.  Leviton's response to my email is that the wifi is getting affected by the fact that it is installed in a metal box with a metal cover.  \"Unfortunately, for wireless in-wall devices, metal wall boxes or metal wall plates typically attenuate the signal, so even if connected, it could be intermittent. While we recognize that it is difficult to change a metal wall box, if you can, we recommend using Leviton Decora wall plates.\"  If this is true, then why aren't the competitors' smart switches affected by the metal?  As you can see in my photo, the Tp-Link Kasa switch is right next to the Leviton switch and has never had any connectivity issues.(3) Lighting Performance.  To dim or brighten the lights, you must hold down the power on or off buttons.  It makes the job very imprecise.  In addition, every Leviton switch produces an audible hum over the internal speaker whenever the dimmer is used (I have halogen as well as LED bulb fixtures and it happens on all of them).  Maybe because it is so compact, Leviton needs to shield the internal speaker from the feedback of the dimmer.  I do not know why it happens but it happens on all four of mine.(4) Smart Home Performance.  Occasionally, I will tell Alexa to turn on the lights, she will say \"OK\", and nothing will happen.  I tell her to turn them off, she says \"OK\", and nothing happens.  I then have to completely reset the switch and join it to my Alexa network.  I have never had to do this with my Alexa Echo or my cheaper switches from Leviton's competitors.  Other times, I will send it a voice command and it will stutter and lock up.  When I try to use the switch to \"drop in\" on another Alexa device, it completely locks up the device and says \"Calling with Alexa is not supp...Calling with Alexa is not supp...Calling with Alexa is not supp...\" in a loop.  Leviton says it is a known bug.  Leviton has now informed me that using the switch to make a call is not supported, even though it has both a mic and a speaker and is connected to Alexa.  Um... why not?Bottom LineIf you expect this to be an Alexa Echo inside your wall, it is not and it probably never will be.  If you expect it to do its job as a dimmable light switch, it will do a poor job of it when compared to switches that are a quarter of the price.  If Amazon is your smart home platform of choice, buy an Alexa Echo for half the price of this switch and you will get all the features along with some decent quality speakers.  Then, buy your remaining switches from Tp-Link Kasa (pictured in the photo) or another capable manufacturer to round out your smart home purchase.  I had high hopes for these switches but they are all being returned after 2 months of struggling to make them work.###leviton<3:10>|back<23:27>|board<43:48>|write<57:64>|sometimes<98:107>|experience<128:138>|person<146:152>|leave<160:167>|reason<182:188>|often<192:197>|ignore<198:204>|give<222:226>|begin<263:268>|year<299:304>|experience<305:315>|computer<321:329>|family<352:358>|full<359:363>|people<367:373>|electric<435:443>|home<451:455>|network<456:463>|electric<471:479>|electrical<471:481>|system<482:488>|solid<496:501>|working<502:509>|wireless<527:535>|mesh<536:540>|network<541:548>|mesh

If it bothers you, I'd try Leviton's own smart dimmers and switches, but they cost more than twice as much as what Kasas cost. App and Alexa integration is pretty easy to setup. Smart light bulbs requires you to turn the switch on all the time if you want to use voice commands or have a smart switch w/o dimmer with it. At that point it gets complicated. It is fairly bulky. I installed one in a bathroom in the same box as an exhaust fan timer/humidity sensor and an outlet tied in. Took me awhile, but it fits. Forced my wires back quite a lot to knock a neutral loose. Luckily it didn't short anything out, so double check your work.###easy<12:16>|install<20:27>|match<36:41>|white<42:47>|match<61:66>|leviton<67:74>|white<75:80>|completely<81:91>|close<97:102>|notice<133:139>|bother<147:154>|leviton<168:175>|own<178:181>|smart<182:187>|dimmer<188:194>|dimmer<188:195>|smart dimmer<182:195>|cost<219:223>|twice<234:239>|kasa<256:261>|cost<262:266>|alexa<276:281>|integration<282:293>|alexa integration<276:293>|pretty<297:303>|easy<304:308>|setup<312:317>|smart<319:324>|bulb<331:336>|require<337:345>|turn<353:357>|voice<404:409>|command<410:418>|voice command<404:418>|smart<429:434>|dimmer<446:452>|point<470:475>|complicated<484:495>|fairly<503:509>|bulky<510:515>|install<519:526>|instal<519:528>|bathroom<538:546>|same<554:558>|the same box<550:562>|box<559:562>|exhaust<569:576>|fan<577:580>|timer<581:586>|sensor<596:602>|outlet<610:616>|tie<617:621>|awhile<634:640>|fit<649:653>|force<655:661>|wire<665:670>|knock<691:696>|neutral<699:706>|loose<707:712>|short<732:737>|double<755:761>|check<762:767>",

      "Deeper than many wifi light switches###deep<0:6>|wifi<17:21>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★☆☆ [2020-11-01] <b>Needs Some Work, Interferes w/Other Alexa Devices</b> My entire house is a smart home - all the lights are on Alexa, the garage doors are on Alexa, etc. Wanting to put voice control everywhere, I bought a Leviton Voice Dimmer to try it out, hoping to buy more of them if I liked it. Do I like it? Well, \"it's complicated\".Right off the bat, the install was fairly difficult. The voice dimmer is deeper than many wifi light switches, so gang box space becomes an issue. Along with this, the wires on the Leviton are stranded copper but with no pre-soldering that many wifi switches have, so wire nuts don't want to grip the wire. After fiddling with them for quite a while with no success, I grabbed my soldering iron and threw some solder on the wire tips - THIS MAKES AN IMMENSE DIFFERENCE IN THE INSTALL IF YOU ARE USING WIRE NUTS!Once installed, the issues began. The Leviton didn't want to stay connected to my wifi, half the time responding to my Alexa commands with \"I'm having trouble connecting to the internet\". A firmware update from my phone (which took several tries) did seem to fix this for the most part, but it does still do this every now and then.Another major issue: This interferes with other Alexa voice devices. My Echos are beyond earshot of the Leviton, but my ecobee5 thermostat (that has Alexa voice control built in) is within range, and this is a nightmare. They won't coordinate with each other, so if I say an Alexa command, they both try listen and respond. So far, no amount of fiddling with the Alexa app, Leviton app, or Ecobee app can get these to not interfere with each other - they both hear the command and try to respond. I resorted to muting the mic on my thermostat so that only the Leviton listened, but this is a shame as the thermostat is a better device with a better speaker.A few more minor annoyances: The speaker in the Leviton is OK but not amazing. Playing music through it sounds lackluster, but I won't ding the voice dimmer too much for this as playing music on the dimmer isn't its primary purpose. Another annoyance is that the Leviton will occasionally respond to itself - if the response it's giving has the word \"Alexa\" in it, it'll sometimes trigger itself and interrupt its own response, thinking someone has said the word \"Alexa\".If Leviton keeps working on this and works out the bugs by issuing new firmware, I can imagine this becoming a great device. But for now, the Leviton Voice Dimmer just seems like a work in progress. It's not quite there yet, and this makes for a frustrating experience. I do hope it gets better, though, as I'd love to have something like this all throughout my house, but it's just not there yet.###alexa<39:44>|entire<60:66>|entire house<60:72>|house<67:72>|smart<78:83>|smart home<78:88>|home<84:88>|a smart home<76:88>|alexa<113:118>|garage<124:130>|door<131:136>|alexa<144:149>|put<167:170>|voice<171:176>|voice control<171:184>|control<177:184>|everywhere<185:195>|leviton<208:215>|voice<216:221>|dimmer<222:228>|hope<244:250>|install<348:355>|fairly<360:366>|difficult<367:376>|voice<382:387>|dimmer<388:394>|deep<398:404>|wifi<415:419>|gang<439:443>|box<444:447>|gang box<439:447>|space<448:453>|become<454:461>|an issue<462:470>|issue<465:470>|wire<493:497>|wire<493:498>|leviton<506:513>|strand<518:526>|copper<527:533>|pre<546:549>|wifi<570:574>|wire<593:597>|wire nut<593:602>|nut<598:602>|wire<626:630>|while<669:674>|success<683:690>|grab<694:701>|throw<724:729>|wire<749:753>|tip<754:758>|difference<783:793>|install<801:808>|wire<826:830>|install<841:848>|instal<841:850>|issue<856:861>|issue<856:862>|begin<863:868>|leviton<874:881>|stay<897:901>|connected<902:911>|wifi<918:922>|respond<938:945>|de<944:948>|respond<938:948>|alexa<955:960>|command<961:968>|alexa command<955:968>|alexa command<955:969>|command<961:969>|trouble<987:994>|connect<995:1005>|internet<1013:1021>|firmware<1026:1034>|firmware update<1026:1041>|update<1035:1041>|a firmware update<1024:1041>|phone<1050:1055>|fix<1095:1098>|most<1112:1116>|part<1117:1121>|still<1135:1140>|now<1155:1158>|major<1176:1181>|issue<1182:1187>|interfere<1194:1203>|interfere<1194:1204>|alexa<1216:1221>|voice<1222:1227>|device<1228:1234>|device<1228:1235>|leviton<1272:1279>|most<1300:1304>|alexa<1317:1322>|voice<1323:1328>|control<1329:1336>|voice control<1323:1336>|build<1337:1342>|range<1357:1362>|nightmare<1378:1387>|alexa<1443:1448>|alexa command<1443:1456>|command<1449:1456>|listen<1472:1478>|respond<1483:1490>|far<1495:1498>|amount<1503:1509>|alexa<1531:1536>|leviton<1542:1549>|leviton app<1542:1553>|interfere<1590:1599>|hear<1628:1632>|command<1637:1644>|respond<1656:1663>|most<1704:1708>|leviton<1728:1735>|listen<1736:1742>|listen<1736:1744>|shame<1760:1765>|a shame<1758:1765>|most<1777:1781>|device<1796:1802>|speaker<1817:1824>|minor<1836:1841>|annoyance<1842:1851>|annoyance<1842:1852>|speaker<1858:1865>|leviton<1873:1880>|play<1904:1911>|music<1912:1917>|sound<1929:1935>|de<1960:1964>|voice<1969:1974>|dimmer<1975:1981>|play<2003:2010>|music<2011:2016>|dimmer<2024:2030>|primary<2041:2048>|purpose<2049:2056>|annoyance<2066:2075>|leviton<2088:2095>|occasionally<2101:2113>|respond<2114:2121>|response<2141:2149>|word<2170:2174>|alexa<2176:2181>|sometimes<2196:2205>|trigger<2206:2213>|own<2239:2242>|response<2243:2251>|word<2283:2287>|alexa<2289:2294>|leviton<2299:2306>|keep<2307:2312>|bug<2347:2351>|issue<2355:2362>|new<2363:2366>|firmware<2367:2375>|imagine<2383:2390>|become<2396:2404>|device<2413:2419>|now<2429:2432>|leviton<2438:2445>|voice<2446:2451>|dimmer<2452:2458>|yet<2516:2519>|frustrating<2542:2553>|experience<2554:2564>|hope<2571:2575>|though<2592:2598>|love<2607:2611>|house<2658:2663>|yet<2689:2692>",
      "Depth of switch###depth<0:5>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2021-02-07] <b>issues with level of dimming and \"fit\" into existing electrical box</b> To start with I'd used this smart switch before and quality of software and product was great. Had installed into a single gang deep box and had no problem at all.This new installation was to replace a simple Lutron slider switch that was in a 2 gang metal box; there was a GFI plug in the other spot.  I'd wired it all up with the wires and switch and plug outside the box . Once i had it all wired correctly,  I (1) noticed that ,in dimming the Kasa light, it only dimmed to about 50% of what the previous lutron switch had done. It was dimming 3 LED ceiling lights over bathroom sinks.  That was minimally acceptable, so I continued closing up box.  In trying to fit the Kasa switch into the box there was just no simple way to get it to fit. It wasn't the depth (although that was tight), it was the height -- just wouldn't fit into the metal box.  I read somewhere else in other reviews that someone was successful \"hammering\" the opening to open it up but it just wasn't worth it .  So i opted to return switch. I will either go back to previous lutron switch or try another brand of smart switch - FIRST verifying the dimensions of the switch.###issue<3:9>|level<15:20>|dim<24:31>|fit<37:40>|exist<47:55>|electrical<56:66>|box<67:70>|electrical box<56:70>|start<78:83>|smart<103:108>|software<138:146>|all<178:181>|instal<174:183>|single<191:197>|a single gang<189:202>|gang<198:202>|single gang<191:202>|deep<203:207>|box<208:211>|no problem<220:230>|problem<223:230>|all<234:237>|new<243:246>|all<251:254>|installation<247:259>|replace<267:274>|simple<277:283>|lutron<284:290>|slider<291:297>|gang<321:325>|2 gang<319:325>|metal<326:331>|box<332:335>|metal box<326:335>|plug<353:357>|spot<371:375>|wire<382:387>|all<391:394>|wire<407:412>|plug<428:432>|box<445:448>|all<465:468>|wire<469:474>|correctly<475:484>|notice<493:500>|dim<510:517>|kasa<522:526>|dim<542:548>|previous<574:582>|lutron<583:589>|dim<614:621>|led<624:627>|ceiling<628:635>|led ceiling<624:635>|led ceiling light<624:642>|ceiling light<628:642>|bathroom<648:656>|all<679:682>|acceptable<684:694>|continue<701:710>|close<711:718>|box<722:725>|fit<741:744>|kasa<749:753>|box<770:773>|simple<792:798>|fit<816:819>|depth<835:840>|tight<860:865>|fit<903:906>|metal<916:921>|box<922:925>|metal box<916:925>|read<930:934>|somewhere<935:944>|hammer<996:1005>|open<1011:1015>|open<1022:1026>|worth<1052:1057>|opt<1069:1074>|return<1078:1084>|back<1110:1114>|previous<1118:1126>|lutron<1127:1133>|brand<1156:1161>|another brand<1148:1161>|smart<1165:1170>|first<1180:1185>|verify<1186:1195>",

We really appreciate being able to just say we're leaving and know that all of the lights in the house will turn off and the alarm will set.These are a little bit harder to install because of the bulk, but they really aren't much larger than other dimmers. We have recessed LED's, and these dimmers actually got rid of the hum we had with the Leviton Maestro dimmers we were using before. We had gotten so used to them that we couldn't figure out why the hum was gone, haha.All in all, I highly recommend these dimmers, and the price is really similar to other higher end dimmers except with smart functionality.

      "Oversized model###oversized<0:9>|model<10:15>|||B079775ZZQ ★☆☆☆☆ [2024-10-05] <b>Kasa is poluting the market with this outdated model</b> I've been working towards converting my entire house to a smart home. Many of the products I selected are from Kasa. About halfway through the conversion, I noticed some smart plugs or switches differed. The newer products are sleek and plug-and-play, while the older models are oversized, wired differently, and often don't connect to my smart network. Recently, I saw a big sale on dimmer switches, so I bought them. I have discovered three stages of this switch, and I have the oldest. They're so big, I can't fit them in the outlet box to hook them up. It's frustrating because I had the day set aside to install three of these and discovered the bait and switch by Kasa when I had the electrical disassembled.

I have it connected using the Google ecosystem and it works as expected. I can't speak for Alexa since we made the decision years ago to get the first Google home and decided it better to stick with one ecosystem.Pros: easy to use, connects with Google, can set up repeatable schedules (that can be turned on and off easily) - useful for when going on vacation and discouraging burglars.Cons: the switch is much deeper than the existing gang box for my home. I had to remove the box (damaging drywall in the process) and replace with a much bigger box in order to install the switch.If you are willing to do some minor remodeling (if you have smaller boxes), then this product is worth it. Would be better if they could just make it a little slimmer.###large<49:55>|connect<111:120>|google<131:137>|ecosystem<138:147>|speak<182:187>|alexa<192:197>|decision<216:224>|year<225:230>|ago<231:234>|first<246:251>|google<252:258>|google home<252:263>|home<259:263>|decide<268:275>|stick<289:294>|ecosystem<304:313>|pro<314:318>|easy<320:324>|connect<333:341>|google<347:353>|set<359:362>|schedule<377:386>|turn<400:406>|easily<418:424>|useful<428:434>|vacation<453:461>|con<488:492>|deep<513:519>|exist<529:537>|gang<538:542>|box<543:546>|gang box<538:546>|home<554:558>|remove<569:575>|box<580:583>|process<609:616>|replace<622:629>|big<642:648>|big box<642:652>|box<649:652>|install<665:672>|willing<695:702>|minor<714:719>|small<744:751>|box<752:755>|box<752:757>|worth<781:786>|slim<843:850>",
      "Deep switch housing###deep<0:4>|housing<12:19>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2022-02-10] <b>Great, but a tight fit in the box</b> I really like Kasa gear and these dimmer switches are no exception. They are easy to control, have a nice solid feel when you press them, and I really like the glow they emit when off so you can find them in the dark. My only complaint is that these dimmers were very hard to fit into the electrical box when I installed them. They were standard ganged metal boxes (3 ganged together) and the contour of them interlocking parts interfered with the switch housing. I eventually made it work by swapping the 2 dimmers around with the 1 single pole I was putting in, but it was a major headache. Would be nice if Kasa gave a little more wiggle room on the housing. Even swapping boxes out wouldn't have helped since the issue was height and not depth. But now they're in and I'm very happy.###tight<16:21>|a tight fit<14:25>|tight fit<16:25>|fit<22:25>|box<33:36>|kasa<55:59>|dimmer<75:81>|these dimmer switch<69:90>|exception<98:107>|easy<118:122>|control<126:133>|solid<147:152>|feel<153:157>|press<167:172>|glow<201:205>|find<236:240>|dark<253:257>|complaint<267:276>|only complaint<262:276>|dimmer<291:297>|dimmer<291:298>|hard<309:313>|fit<317:320>|electrical<330:340>|box<341:344>|electrical box<330:344>|the electrical box<326:344>|instal<352:361>|standard<378:386>|gang<387:393>|metal<394:399>|box<400:403>|metal box<394:405>|box<400:405>|gang<409:415>|together<416:424>|part<463:468>|interfere<469:479>|housing<496:503>|eventually<507:517>|swap<534:542>|dimmer<549:555>|dimmer<549:556>|single<575:581>|single pole<575:586>|pole<582:586>|put<593:600>|major<618:623>|headache<624:632>|kasa<651:655>|give<656:660>|room<682:686>|housing<694:701>|swap<708:716>|box<717:720>|box<717:722>|help<741:747>|issue<758:763>|depth<783:788>|now<794:797>|happy<822:827>",
      "Height of switch|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2021-02-07] <b>issues with level of dimming and \"fit\" into existing electrical box</b> To start with I'd used this smart switch before and quality of software and product was great. Had installed into a single gang deep box and had no problem at all.This new installation was to replace a simple Lutron slider switch that was in a 2 gang metal box; there was a GFI plug in the other spot.  I'd wired it all up with the wires and switch and plug outside the box . Once i had it all wired correctly,  I (1) noticed that ,in dimming the Kasa light, it only dimmed to about 50% of what the previous lutron switch had done. It was dimming 3 LED ceiling lights over bathroom sinks.  That was minimally acceptable, so I continued closing up box.  In trying to fit the Kasa switch into the box there was just no simple way to get it to fit. It wasn't the depth (although that was tight), it was the height -- just wouldn't fit into the metal box.  I read somewhere else in other reviews that someone was successful \"hammering\" the opening to open it up but it just wasn't worth it .  So i opted to return switch. I will either go back to previous lutron switch or try another brand of smart switch - FIRST verifying the dimensions of the switch.###issue<3:9>|level<15:20>|dim<24:31>|fit<37:40>|exist<47:55>|electrical<56:66>|box<67:70>|electrical box<56:70>|start<78:83>|smart<103:108>|software<138:146>|all<178:181>|instal<174:183>|single<191:197>|a single gang<189:202>|gang<198:202>|single gang<191:202>|deep<203:207>|box<208:211>|no problem<220:230>|problem<223:230>|all<234:237>|new<243:246>|all<251:254>|installation<247:259>|replace<267:274>|simple<277:283>|lutron<284:290>|slider<291:297>|gang<321:325>|2 gang<319:325>|metal<326:331>|box<332:335>|metal box<326:335>|plug<353:357>|spot<371:375>|wire<382:387>|all<391:394>|wire<407:412>|plug<428:432>|box<445:448>|all<465:468>|wire<469:474>|correctly<475:484>|notice<493:500>|dim<510:517>|kasa<522:526>|dim<542:548>|previous<574:582>|lutron<583:589>|dim<614:621>|led<624:627>|ceiling<628:635>|led ceiling<624:635>|led ceiling light<624:642>|ceiling light<628:642>|bathroom<648:656>|all<679:682>|acceptable<684:694>|continue<701:710>|close<711:718>|box<722:725>|fit<741:744>|kasa<749:753>|box<770:773>|simple<792:798>|fit<816:819>|depth<835:840>|tight<860:865>|fit<903:906>|metal<916:921>|box<922:925>|metal box<916:925>|read<930:934>|somewhere<935:944>|hammer<996:1005>|open<1011:1015>|open<1022:1026>|worth<1052:1057>|opt<1069:1074>|return<1078:1084>|back<1110:1114>|previous<1118:1126>|lutron<1127:1133>|brand<1156:1161>|another brand<1148:1161>|smart<1165:1170>|first<1180:1185>|verify<1186:1195>"

I liked the idea of the dimming. There isn’t really much out there on this subset of smart switches so I’m reviewing this to help get awareness out there.Pros: Easy to install, good documentation. Low Profile. The app seems to do a good job allowing for dimming control and some neat options.Cons: Horrific audio quality. It’s actually scratchy and horribly tinny. You would not want to listen to music given how scratchy and weak the audio is.  This ‘Alexa’ does not support SiriusXM or Apple Music playback (the EcobeeSwitch+ does). I’m sure there are more support limitations, I just haven’t found them yet.  When the music is playing Alexa won’t respond to you to shut it off. The built in speaker does not appear to have volume controls that you can adjust.I am returning this to buy a simple dimmer and a nice Alexa Echo. Stay away or at least know what you’re getting into.###sound<12:17>|lack<18:23>|popular<24:31>|support<36:43>|leviton<59:66>|decora<67:73>|leviton decora<59:73>|smart<74:79>|decora smart<67:79>|leviton decora smart<59:79>|voice<80:85>|dimmer<86:92>|die<117:121>|year<133:138>|many year<128:138>|year of use<133:145>|replacement<178:189>|idea<203:207>|dimming<215:222>|dim<215:222>|smart<276:281>|help<316:320>|pro<345:349>|easy<351:355>|install<359:366>|documentation<373:386>|low<388:391>|profile<392:399>|job<428:431>|allow<432:440>|dimming<445:452>|dim<445:452>|control<453:460>|neat<470:474>|option<475:482>|con<483:487>|actually<518:526>|listen<578:584>|music<588:593>|give<594:599>|weak<617:621>|alexa<643:648>|support<659:666>|apple<679:684>|music<685:690>|support<750:757>|limitation<758:769>|find<786:791>|yet<797:800>|music<812:817>|play<821:828>|alexa<829:834>|respond<841:848>|shut<859:863>|build<876:881>|speaker<885:892>|appear<902:908>|volume<917:923>|control<924:931>|control<924:932>|adjust<946:952>|return<958:967>|simple<982:988>|dimmer<989:995>|alexa<1007:1012>|alexa echo<1007:1017>|echo<1013:1017>|stay<1019:1023>|away<1024:1028>|least<1035:1040>",

      "Compact size###compact<0:7>|size<8:12>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2020-08-21] <b>Simple set-up, find out which wires are hot first!</b> Pretty simple system once you know what you’re doing. My house’s wires were not colored or labeled so that had me doing some running up and down to the breaker and see which wire went where, but outside of that, easy peasy. The app works really well, and we have a Google smart home eco system going with the Home and the Minis, and the Kasa app  integrates seamlessly with our devices. Used it in 2 bedrooms and the living room. I will say not all light fixtures are going to dim so seamlessly, like my living room lights. The bedrooms have flush mount LED disk lights, and those dim more smoothly. Regardless, we’re happy with the switches and would get them again. I’d like to try the 3-way switches next.###simple<3:9>|set<10:13>|set up<10:16>|find<18:22>|wire<33:37>|wire<33:38>|hot<43:46>|first<47:52>|pretty<58:64>|simple<65:71>|system<72:78>|house<115:120>|wire<123:127>|wire<123:128>|color<138:145>|label<149:156>|run<183:190>|down<198:202>|breaker<210:217>|wire<232:236>|easy<270:274>|easy<276:280>|google<323:329>|smart<330:335>|home<336:340>|smart home<330:340>|system<345:351>|home<367:371>|kasa<395:399>|the kasa app<391:403>|kasa app<395:403>|integrate<405:415>|seamlessly<416:426>|device<436:443>|room<461:465>|bedroom<458:466>|living<475:481>|living room<475:486>|the living room<471:486>|room<482:486>|fixture<513:521>|light fixture<507:521>|dim<535:538>|seamlessly<542:552>|living<562:568>|room<569:573>|living room<562:573>|living room light<562:580>|room<589:593>|bedroom<586:594>|flush<600:605>|mount<606:611>|flush mount<600:611>|lead<612:615>|dim<639:642>|smoothly<648:656>|regardless<658:668>|happy<676:681>|again<719:724>|3 way<746:751>|3 way switch<746:760>|next<761:765>",
      "Clears up space compared to bulky smart plug###clear<0:6>|space<10:15>|compare<16:24>|bulky<28:33>|smart<34:39>|smart plug<34:44>|plug<40:44>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★★☆ [2023-11-28] <b>Amazing, almost perfect</b> This is fantastic concept and clears up so much space for areas where you don't want a bulky smart plug connected. We're personally using it in our kitchen near the end of the counter. The bottom plug is for the always on coffee machine and the top plug (the smart outlet section) is for the Christmas season when we run Christmas Lights up on top of the cabinet. It's perfectly located to allow us to run a flat plugged extension chord up to the top of the cabinets between the wall and the open gap from the cabinet.The outlet itself was very easy to install...like a typical receptacle and I love that it uses the compression style crimps on the sides of the receptacle where you don't need to \"hook/loop\" the conductor cables. It's the standard size for GFCI receptacle so it fits just fine into the box. The reactive speed when using Apples Homekit to turn it on and off is near instant, and the button in the middle for manual control of the top section is easy to use.There are only a few things I wish I could change about this receptacle:1) Make it so both Plugs can be controlled, not just the top half.2) Use a quieter relay...The contactor is LOUD when it turns on/off....almost comically loud....I'm honestly surprised Leviton was okay with this.3) Thread connectivity would also be fantastic to have built into these receptacles to help strengthen the connection for multiple receptacles and other devices using the Thread protocol.If all 3 of my changes could be incorporated. I would throw money at this product in a very irrespirable way. There's nothing else out on the market like this...the closest you'll get is a smart power strip (which obviously has it's own advantages/disadvantages compared to it all being built into a receptacle in the wall.)The price point is a little high for what is described above. I picked this up on sale for about 20% off and I'd say it's worth that....but with overall cost compared to what you get compared to getting a smart plug or a smart power strip, you'd likely be better off going that route. Unless like me, you wanted a specific use-case where not having a large brick hanging out of the wall would be more preferable then this thing is awesome. It looks incredibly clean, it's super responsive, and unfortunately it's also super loud (Which I guess is a good way to make sure it's working?)4/5 for what it is....5/5 if they include those three updates I'm looking for. Great product.###almost<12:18>|concept<49:56>|clear<61:67>|space<79:84>|area<89:94>|bulky<118:123>|smart<124:129>|smart plug<124:134>|plug<130:134>|connect<135:144>|personally<152:162>|kitchen<179:186>|end<196:199>|counter<207:214>|bottom<220:226>|plug<227:231>|always<243:249>|coffee<253:259>|machine<260:267>|top<276:279>|plug<280:284>|smart<290:295>|outlet<296:302>|christmas<323:332>|run<348:351>|christmas<352:361>|lights<362:368>|top<375:378>|cabinet<386:393>|perfectly<400:409>|locate<410:417>|allow<421:426>|run<433:436>|flat<439:443>|plug<444:448>|plug<444:451>|extension<452:461>|top<478:481>|cabinet<489:496>|cabinet<489:497>|wall<510:514>|open<523:527>|gap<528:531>|cabinet<541:548>|outlet<553:559>|easy<576:580>|install<584:591>|typical<601:608>|receptacle<609:619>|love<626:630>|style<660:665>|side<680:685>|receptacle<693:703>|hook<729:733>|loop<734:738>|cable<754:760>|standard<771:779>|size<780:784>|gfci<789:793>|receptacle<794:804>|fit<811:815>|box<835:838>|speed<853:858>|homekit<877:884>|turn<888:892>|instant<915:922>|button<932:938>|middle<946:952>|the middle<942:952>|manual<957:963>|manual control<957:971>|control<964:971>|top<979:982>|easy<994:998>|wish<1036:1040>|change<1049:1055>|receptacle<1067:1077>|plug<1097:1102>|control<1110:1117>|control<1110:1120>|top<1135:1138>|relay<1161:1166>|loud<1186:1190>|turn<1199:1203>|turn<1199:1204>|almost<1215:1221>|loud<1232:1236>|honestly<1244:1252>|surprise<1253:1262>|leviton<1263:1270>|thread<1293:1299>|connectivity<1300:1312>|build<1345:1350>|receptacle<1362:1372>|receptacle<1362:1373>|help<1377:1381>|connection<1397:1407>|multiple<1412:1420>|receptacle<1421:1431>|receptacle<1421:1432>|device<1443:1450>|thread<1461:1467>|protocol<1468:1476>|change<1492:1498>|change<1492:1499>|throw<1531:1536>|money<1537:1542>|market<1619:1625>|the market<1615:1625>|close<1642:1649>|smart<1666:1671>|power<1672:1677>|power strip<1672:1683>|strip<1678:1683>|obviously<1691:1700>|own<1710:1713>|compare<1739:1747>|build<1764:1769>|receptacle<1777:1787>|wall<1795:1799>|price<1805:1810>|price point<1805:1816>|point<1811:1816>|high<1829:1833>|describe<1846:1855>|pick<1865:1871>|sale<1883:1887>|worth<1923:1928>|overall<1946:1953>|cost<1954:1958>|compare<1959:1967>|compare<1984:1992>|smart<2006:2011>|plug<2012:2016>|smart plug<2006:2016>|smart<2022:2027>|power<2028:2033>|power strip<2028:2039>|strip<2034:2039>|likely<2047:2053>|specific<2115:2123>|use case<2124:2132>|case<2128:2132>|large<2152:2157>|wall<2183:2187>|incredibly<2250:2260>|clean<2261:2266>|super<2273:2278>|responsive<2279:2289>|unfortunately<2295:2308>|super<2319:2324>|loud<2325:2329>|guess<2339:2344>|include<2420:2427>|update<2440:2447>",
      "Shallower depth###depth<10:15>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★☆☆ [2021-04-27] <b>Bring Back The Screw Terminals</b> The 2nd Gen switches/dimmers now have 5 lead wires hanging from the box instead of screw terminals. This made the installation of a switch and dimmer today much longer to do. Last week, I had to do a 3-gang box (all 1st Gen switches) because one of them failed. Replacing it with a new 2nd Gen switch was a pain in-the-you-know-what. Had to redo the whole box because of the different wiring. If there were screw terminals, most of the time it's simply backing off the old switch/dimmer (dumb or smart) and \"dropping in\" the new (with the exception on the neutral wires).Though the 2nd Gen switches/dimmers are a bit shallower, having to now use wire nuts and addition of lead wires adds EXTRA stuff being pushed in the workbox. You are NOT saving on space. I ended up cutting back several lead wires to save on space.I haven't had enough time to comment about performance but I did notice that these connected to Wi-Fi extremely fast vs the 1st Gen switches/dimmers that I have - within seconds(!!) of the power being turned back on after installation.###bring<3:8>|back<9:13>|screw<18:23>|2nd<42:45>|2nd gen<42:49>|the 2nd gen<38:49>|gen<46:49>|2nd gen switch<42:56>|2nd gen switch<42:58>|dimmer<59:65>|dimmer<59:66>|now<67:70>|lead<78:82>|wire<83:87>|wire<83:88>|hang<89:96>|box<106:109>|instead<110:117>|screw<121:126>|screw terminal<121:136>|terminal<127:136>|installation<152:164>|dimmer<181:187>|today<188:193>|long<199:205>|last<213:217>|week<218:222>|3 gang<238:244>|gang<240:244>|3 gang box<238:248>|gang box<240:248>|box<245:248>|1st<254:257>|gen<258:261>|1st gen<254:261>|1st gen switch<254:270>|fail<292:298>|replace<300:309>|new<320:323>|2nd<324:327>|gen<328:331>|2nd gen<324:331>|2nd gen switch<324:338>|pain<345:349>|a pain<343:349>|now<362:365>|whole<388:393>|box<394:397>|different<413:422>|wiring<423:429>|screw<445:450>|terminal<451:460>|screw terminal<445:460>|most<462:466>|simply<484:490>|back<491:495>|back<491:498>|old<507:510>|dimmer<518:524>|dumb<526:530>|smart<534:539>|drop<546:554>|new<563:566>|exception<577:586>|neutral<594:601>|wire<602:606>|wire<602:607>|2nd<620:623>|the 2nd gen<616:627>|2nd gen<620:627>|gen<624:627>|2nd gen switch<620:634>|2nd gen switch<620:636>|dimmer<637:643>|dimmer<637:644>|now<676:679>|wire<684:688>|nut<689:693>|wire nut<684:693>|addition<698:706>|lead<710:714>|wire<715:719>|wire<715:720>|add<721:725>|extra<726:731>|push<744:750>|box<762:765>|save<779:785>|space<789:794>|end<798:803>|cut<807:814>|back<815:819>|lead<828:832>|wire<833:837>|wire<833:838>|save<842:846>|space<850:855>|comment<885:892>|performance<899:910>|notice<921:927>|connect<939:948>|wi<952:954>|fi<955:957>|wi fi<952:957>|extremely<958:967>|fast<968:972>|1st<980:983>|1st gen<980:987>|gen<984:987>|1st gen switch<980:996>|dimmer<997:1003>|dimmer<997:1004>|second<1026:1033>|power<1045:1050>|turn<1057:1063>|back<1064:1068>|installation<1078:1090>",

The pain in this is that the Apple Home integration requires that I re-scan the little QR code and it is INSIDE the wall when the outlet is installed so I have to make sure I keep the code that came with the documentation!Original review:I have spent hours fussing with smart plugs (looking at you wemo with thread plug) that would disconnect from my smart home, or wouldn't automate despite the schedule I set for them, or not respond despite being connected to my home network.These Leviton outlets are a revelation by comparison: they are very easy to set up, they follow automation/schedules flawlessly, and I absolutely love that they don't require an additional \"box\" on top of a plug like other smart plugs because they ARE the plug!My use case is to save money on my electric bill and because I have a time-based plan (for EV charging) I need to turn off unwanted leechers of power during peak hours. My biggest issue was charging devices: phones, tablets, and watches--each which would get plugged in before going to sleep but my plan provides the cheapest rates after midnight and I go to bed before that. The devices then start charging during peak pricing because they don't wait to charge. Enter these smart outlets! Now I can plug in my devices while the smart outlet is off and once the outlet turns on after midnight the devices charge on the cheapest rate and are ready for the next day!Other examples include turning off devices like TVs, streaming boxes like AppleTVs and Roku boxes, and smart speakers in rooms overnight where they aren't gonna be used so that they don't leech power. Again, you can do all this with other smart plugs but these work so well that they aren't as much of a hassle and are less bulky than over-the-plug style smart plugs.###easy<3:7>|set<11:14>|random<22:28>|disconnect<29:39>|disconnect<29:40>|experience<56:67>|random<68:74>|disconnect<75:85>|disconnect<75:86>|outlet<96:102>|outlet<96:103>|re<106:108>|power<117:122>|power outage<117:130>|outage<123:130>|outlet<152:158>|outlet<152:159>|stop<165:169>|top<166:169>|re<170:172>|respond<170:177>|respond<170:180>|leviton<196:203>|apple<208:213>|home<214:218>|apple home<208:218>|find<242:247>|again<268:273>|re<280:282>|remove<280:286>|device<300:307>|hold<309:313>|button<323:329>|outlet<346:352>|outlet<346:353>|factory<371:378>|re<379:381>|factory reset<371:384>|reset<379:384>|set<381:384>|set<391:394>|again<403:408>|pain<414:418>|apple<439:444>|the apple home<435:449>|home<445:449>|apple home<439:449>|home integration<445:461>|integration<450:461>|re<462:464>|re<467:469>|require<462:469>|require<462:470>|re<478:480>|scan<481:485>|qr<497:499>|code<500:504>|qr code<497:504>|wall<526:530>|outlet<540:546>|instal<550:559>|re<580:582>|keep<585:589>|code<594:598>|re<641:643>|spend<655:660>|hour<661:666>|smart<680:685>|plug<686:690>|smart plug<680:691>|plug<686:691>|wemo<708:712>|re<720:722>|thread<718:724>|plug<725:729>|disconnect<742:752>|smart<761:766>|home<767:771>|smart home<761:771>|automate<785:793>|schedule<806:814>|set<817:820>|re<838:840>|respond<838:845>|connect<860:869>|home<876:880>|network<881:888>|leviton<895:902>|outlet<903:909>|outlet<903:910>|re<912:914>|re<917:919>|comparison<931:941>|re<949:951>|easy<957:961>|set<965:968>|follow<978:984>|automation<985:995>|schedule<996:1004>|schedule<996:1005>|less<1010:1014>|flawlessly<1006:1016>|absolutely<1024:1034>|love<1035:1039>|re<1056:1058>|re<1061:1063>|require<1056:1063>|additional<1067:1077>|box<1079:1082>|top<1087:1090>|plug<1096:1100>|smart<1112:1117>|plug<1118:1122>|plug<1118:1123>|smart plug<1112:1123>|plug<1145:1149>|case<1157:1161>|use case<1153:1161>|save<1168:1172>|money<1173:1178>|electric<1185:1193>|base<1225:1230>|plan<1231:1235>|charge<1244:1252>|turn<1264:1268>|power<1294:1299>|hour<1312:1317>|big<1322:1329>|big issue<1322:1335>|issue<1330:1335>|charge<1340:1348>|device<1349:1356>|phone<1358:1364>|tablet<1366:1373>|watch<1379:1386>|plug<1409:1413>|plug<1409:1416>|re<1424:1426>|sleep<1436:1441>|plan<1449:1453>|provide<1454:1462>|cheap<1467:1475>|rate<1476:1480>|rate<1476:1481>|midnight<1488:1496>|bed<1509:1512>|re<1517:1519>|device<1530:1537>|start<1543:1548>|charge<1549:1557>|pricing<1570:1577>|wait<1597:1601>|charge<1605:1611>|enter<1613:1618>|smart<1625:1630>|outlet<1631:1637>|outlet<1631:1638>|now<1640:1643>|plug<1650:1654>|device<1661:1668>|smart<1679:1684>|outlet<1685:1691>|once<1703:1707>|outlet<1712:1718>|turn<1719:1723>|turn<1719:1724>|midnight<1734:1742>|device<1747:1754>|charge<1755:1761>|cheap<1769:1777>|rate<1778:1782>|re<1788:1790>|re<1791:1793>|ready<1791:1796>|next<1805:1809>|example<1820:1828>|include<1829:1836>|turn<1837:1841>|turn<1837:1844>|device<1849:1856>|tv<1862:1865>|re<1869:1871>|box<1877:1880>|box<1877:1882>|apple<1888:1893>|tv<1893:1896>|box<1906:1909>|box<1906:1911>|smart<1917:1922>|speaker<1923:1931>|smart speaker<1917:1931>|room<1935:1940>|re<1954:1956>|re<1963:1965>|power<2008:2013>|again<2015:2020>|smart<2053:2058>|plug<2059:2063>|plug<2059:2064>|smart plug<2053:2064>|re<2099:2101>|hassle<2118:2124>|re<2130:2132>|less<2133:2137>|bulky<2138:2143>|plug<2158:2162>|style<2163:2168>|smart<2169:2174>|plug<2175:2179>|plug<2175:2180>|smart plug<2169:2180>",

This is the only one giving me headaches.  I would reconnect it to the wifi and it'll work for a day or two and then it would loose connection.  Gave up and just used it as a regular on / off switch for now.Also, why can't TP-Link just leave a little bit more room in the cover cut out to give easier access to the reset switch?

      "Small up and down controls###small<0:5>|down<13:17>|control<18:26>|||B079775ZZQ ★★☆☆☆ [2023-01-14] <b>Not the best design and no web interface. Requires app for install and updates.</b> These are smart / WiFi dimmers that are hard-wired into a junction box for switched lights.Only supports 2.4 Ghz WifI band -- some of the hardware variants used in individual dimmers will stay connected indefinitely and some will disconnect and reconnect randomly and as frequently every few minutes.  It apparently has to do with the WiFi chips, firmware, or both.Sometimes the brightness level LEDs on the top if the dimmer will get stuck and stay on and at other times, they turn off after a few seconds.Alexa integration is OK for basic functions, but gets complicated rapidly as the number of named devices increases. You will need to come up with creative names if, for example, you have more than one dimmer per named room and then you will have to remember which are which. There is no alexa integration for calibration. firmware updates, or time or time zone adjustments.These dimmers work for most light sources:  incandescent (but wattage is limited to 200) and some dimmable fluorescent and some LED bulbs.Requires an app for initial installation, dimmer calibration, and for firmware or time updates.There is no easy reference source on the product page for bulb compatibility, so be sure you test your bulbs before going to the trouble to install these dimmers.Worked poorly on Feit LED candelabra bulbs: there was noticeable bulb flickering at dimming levels below 60 percent.Single pole (one switch) only.  Requires a neutral and ground connection, so there will be four wire connections per dimmer (green, white, and two for the controlled device).  Oddly, the green and white connections require wire nuts but the line and load are screwed into the side of the dimmer.Large back cover uses a lot of space in the junction box, so not the best choice for small or crowded junction boxes.The front up and down controls are too small and should be bigger.The indicator LED bulb is very dim and cannot be seen in a bright room.  A dimmable indicator on a dimmer would have been be a logical design choice, but it's not available on this model.There still is no web interface for these smart dimmers -- only app controls.  The Apple app does not support accessibility options and is not suitable for those with vision issues -- moreover, the contrast and size on the app screens is very poor even for those with good vision -- especially if your Apple device uses adaptive backlighting.There is a removable, screwless faceplate which is a nice feature. The face plate and switch front are a high gloss finish that shows fingerprints and scratches; a matte finish would be much better.There are two very small, unmarked and hard-to-access switches built into the dimmer bottom.  One reboots the dimmer without removing the programming and account information. The other wipes the device and removes it from an account.For those who prefer a flawless installation, be sure that the dimmer is not angled when you screw it into the junction box.  If there is any angle, the face plate will not fit flush with the dimmer. This is especially important if there are more than one switch or dimmer in a junction box.###design<16:22>|web<30:33>|interface<34:43>|face<39:43>|require<45:53>|install<62:69>|update<74:81>|smart<97:102>|wifi<105:109>|dim<110:113>|dimmer<110:116>|dimmer<110:117>|hard<127:131>|wire<132:136>|wire<132:137>|junction<145:153>|box<154:157>|junction

      "Four buttons including three upper buttons###button<5:12>|include<13:22>|upper<29:34>|button<35:42>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★★☆ [2025-01-17] <b>Works well, upper 3 buttons only trigger a single scene each</b> Like the other Leviton smart switches, this works really well.A small physical annoyance unique to this 4 button switch that I don't really like the feel of the button presses (hard to describe, but not a very firm push or click or etc, so sometimes you aren't really sure you pushed it hard enough, or in the right place, or not).Another thing to note is that the 3 upper buttons only control 1 scene each. That means that any push of the button triggers the same scene. Apple's Home app doesn't easily let you create a \"toggle light\" scene. So if you want each button to first turn a light on, then on the next push to turn it off, you need to go through some hoops to convert the Apple Home scene into a \"shortcut\" and then use IF/ELSE conditions in the shortcut to make this work. This is really an Apple Home limitation, but something to be aware of since there is really no way to make it work without these steps. After that setup, the button does work perfectly fine to toggle a light, but note that the response time is a bit extra delayed (2-3 seconds between button push and action... again, likely this is a result of the need to setup the special Apple Home shortcut that has to run, and not caused by the switch itself)###upper<15:20>|button<23:29>|button<23:30>|trigger<36:43>|single<46:52>|scene<53:58>|leviton<83:90>|smart<91:96>|leviton smart switch<83:105>|small<132:137>|physical<138:146>|annoyance<147:156>|unique<157:163>|button<174:180>|feel<217:221>|button<229:235>|press<236:243>|hard<245:249>|describe<253:261>|push<283:287>|click<291:296>|sometimes<308:317>|push<345:349>|push<345:351>|hard<355:359>|place<384:389>|note<416:420>|upper<435:440>|button<441:447>|button<441:448>|control<454:461>|scene<464:469>|mean<481:486>|push<496:500>|button<508:514>|trigger<515:522>|trigger<515:523>|same<528:532>|scene<533:538>|apple<540:545>|home<548:552>|apple home<540:552>|apple home app<540:556>|easily<565:571>|let<572:575>|create<580:586>|toggle<590:596>|scene<604:609>|button<631:637>|first<641:646>|turn<647:651>|next<676:680>|push<681:685>|turn<689:693>|hoop<730:735>|convert<739:746>|apple<751:756>|the apple home<747:761>|home<757:761>|apple home<751:761>|scene<762:767>|shortcut<776:784>|condition<807:817>|shortcut<825:833>|apple<871:876>|an apple<868:876>|home<877:881>|apple home<871:881>|limitation<882:892>|aware<914:919>|step<982:987>|setup<1000:1005>|button<1011:1017>|perfectly<1028:1037>|toggle<1046:1052>|note<1066:1070>|response<1080:1088>|response time<1080:1093>|extra<1103:1108>|delay<1109:1116>|second<1122:1129>|button<1138:1144>|push<1145:1149>|action<1154:1160>|again<1164:1169>|likely<1171:1177>|result<1188:1194>|setup<1210:1215>|apple<1228:1233>|apple home<1228:1238>|home<1234:1238>|shortcut<1239:1247>|run<1260:1263>|cause<1273:1279>",
      "Only bottom of switch activates on/off###bottom<5:11>|activate<22:31>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2021-04-30] <b>Very happy to have this installed.</b> I'm using a set of string lights with 15 3.5W dimmable LED bulbs (52.5W total) as the main lighting in my living room and for years I was using a Lutron on-cord sliding dimmer.  It worked, but the dimming range was very limited and the lights would flicker and/or surge when dimmed.  I wanted a proper dimming switch but the lights are just plugged into an outlet and run up the wall to the ceiling.I ended up installing this switch in a single gang surface-mount box using an extension cord that I cut the female end off of to feed the switch and then the cord to the string lights (with the plug cut off) exiting the switch.  Now I have a proper switch to turn the lights on mounted to the wall just inside my door, with the added bonus of being able to control it from my phone.  The range of dimming is much better than what I had before and there is no more flickering or surging at any level.I do wish would be that the switch itself had more of a tactile feel; it has a springy feel to it, but more of a 'click' would be nice.  Also, it would be nice if you could push either the top or bottom of the switch to activate (it's just the bottom for on & off).  It's just a \"what you're used to\" thing, I'm still very happy with this switch.###happy<8:13>|instal<27:36>|set<54:57>|string<61:67>|string light<61:74>|dimmable<88:96>|able<92:96>|dimmable led<88:100>|led<97:100>|bulb<101:106>|led bulb<97:106>|dimmable led bulb<88:106>|total<114:119>|main<128:132>|lighting<133:141>|living<148:154>|living room<148:159>|room<155:159>|year<168:173>|lutron<188:194>|cord<198:202>|dimmer<211:217>|dim<239:246>|dimming<239:246>|range<247:252>|limited<262:269>|flicker<291:298>|surge<306:311>|dim<317:323>|proper<337:343>|dimming<344:351>|dim<344:351>|plug<383:387>|plug<383:390>|outlet<399:405>|run<410:413>|wall<421:425>|ceiling<433:440>|end<443:446>|end<443:448>|instal<452:462>|single<480:486>|a single gang<478:491>|single gang<480:491>|gang<487:491>|surface<492:499>|mount<500:505>|box<506:509>|extension<519:528>|cord<529:533>|cut<541:544>|end<556:559>|cord<599:603>|string<611:617>|string light<611:624>|plug<635:639>|cut<640:643>|now<670:673>|proper<683:689>|turn<700:704>|mount<719:724>|mount<719:726>|wall<734:738>|door<754:758>|add<769:774>|bonus<775:780>|able<790:794>|control<798:805>|phone<817:822>|range<829:834>|dimming<838:845>|dim<838:845>|flicker<905:912>|flickering<905:915>|surge<919:926>|level<934:939>|wish<945:949>|tactile<996:1003>|feel<1004:1008>|feel<1027:1031>|click<1054:1059>|push<1113:1117>|top<1129:1132>|bottom<1136:1142>|activate<1160:1168>|bottom<1184:1190>|still<1252:1257>|happy<1263:1268>",
      "Restart and reset buttons at the bottom###restart<0:7>|reset<12:17>|reset button<12:25>|button<18:25>|bottom<33:39>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2023-08-23] <b>First Kasa Matter device</b> This is the first Matter smart device I purchased. I have purchased and use wifi, zigbee and z-wave devices and now I wanted to test out this Kasa Smart Dimmer Matter switch. Packaging was nice, less packing material compared to their other smart devices, so a plus for the environment. Comes with wire nuts, screws, face plate attached, instructions and a qr code sticker for the device. On the switch itself is the MAC number of the device and the QR code number to enter manually. The switch has only two pigtail wires and they are for common and ground. The load and line wires are screwed into terminals. I would have liked the option to have a ground screw terminal also. Less wires in the outlet box makes for an easier installation.Speaking of installation, that was simple and straight forward. Turn off you power at the breaker, test the line an install like a pro. Took me about 5 minutes to install, was going for record, just wanted to make sure it was done right. If the switch is in a multi-gang box and you are reusing your existing faceplate, then you might want to file down the bottom of the opening on the faceplate to allow access to the restart and reset button. It is a tight squeeze without trimming the faceplate and the buttons would not move to either position. I filed about 1mm off to make sure it fit properly.Once I had everything put back together it was time to connect it Kasa app, Home Assistant, Google Home and Amazon Alexa. It was simple to set-up Google Home and then share it with Home Assistant, but not so much with Amazon Alexa. I spent hours trying different configurations to share it with Amazon Alexa but it failed every time. The only way to set them up on all devices is to install on Amazon Alexa separately. All other devices can be installed and shared with Google Home. Once everything was setup all voice commands and automations are working perfectly. Given time Amazon will improve their matter support for device sharing.###first<3:8>|kasa<9:13>|matter<14:20>|device<21:27>|first<44:49>|matter<50:56>|smart<57:62>|device<63:69>|wifi<108:112>|zigbee<114:120>|z wave<125:131>|wave<127:131>|device<132:138>|device<132:139>|now<144:147>|test<160:164>|kasa<174:178>|kasa smart<174:184>|smart<179:184>|dimmer<185:191>|kasa smart dimmer<174:191>|smart dimmer<179:191>|matter<192:198>|packaging<207:216>|less<227:231>|material<240:248>|compare<249:257>|smart<273:278>|device<279:285>|other smart device<267:286>|device<279:286>|plus<293:297>|wire<330:334>|nut<335:339>|wire nut<330:339>|screw<341:346>|screw<341:347>|face<349:353>|plate<354:359>|face plate<349:359>|attach<360:368>|instruction<370:382>|qr<389:391>|qr code<389:396>|code<392:396>|a qr code<387:396>|sticker<397:404>|device<413:419>|number<453:459>|device<467:473>|qr<482:484>|code<485:489>|the qr code<478:489>|qr code<482:489>|number<490:496>|enter<500:505>|manually<506:514>|pigtail<540:547>|wire<548:552>|wire<548:553>|common<571:577>|ground<582:588>|load<594:598>|line<603:607>|wire<608:612>|wire<608:613>|screw<618:623>|screw<618:625>|terminal<631:639>|terminal<631:640>|option<665:671>|ground<682:688>|screw<689:694>|screw terminal<689:703>|terminal<695:703>|less<710:714>|wire<715:719>|wire<715:720>|outlet<728:734>|outlet box<728:738>|box<735:738>|easy<752:758>|install<759:766>|easy installation<752:771>|installation<759:771>|speak<772:780>|install<784:791>|installation<784:796>|simple<807:813>|straight<818:826>|forward<827:834>|turn<836:840>|power<849:854>|breaker<862:869>|test<871:875>|line<880:884>|install<888:895>|pro<903:906>|5 minute<922:931>|minute<924:931>|install<935:942>|multi<1032:1037>|gang<1038:1042>|a multi gang<1030:1042>|multi gang<1032:1042>|multi gang box<1032:1046>|gang box<1038:1046>|box<1043:1046>|exist<1072:1080>|face<1081:1085>|faceplate<1081:1090>|plate<1085:1090>|file<1115:1119>|bottom<1129:1135>|face<1158:1162>|faceplate<1158:1167>|plate<1162:1167>|allow<1171:1176>|access<1177:1183>|restart<1191:1198>|set<1205:1208>|reset<1203:1208>|button<1209:1215>|reset button<1203:1215>|tight<1225:1230>|trim<1247:1255>|face<1260:1264>|faceplate<1260:1269>|plate<1264:1269>|button<1278:1284>|button<1278:1285>|move<1296:1300>|position<1311:1319>|file<1323:1327>|file<1323:1328>|fit<1359:1362>|pro<1363:1366>|properly<1363:1371>|once<1372:1376>|put<1394:1397>|together<1403:1411>|connect<1427:1434>|kasa<1438:1442>|kasa app<1438:1446>|home<1448:1452>|home assistant<1448:1462>|assistant<1453:1462>|google<1464:1470>|google home<1464:1475>|home<1471:1475>|amazon alexa<1480:1492>|alexa<1487:1492>|simple<1501:1507>|set<1511:1514>|google<1518:1524>|home<1525:1529>|google home<1518:1529>|share<1539:1544>|home<1553:1557>|home assistant<1553:1567>|assistant<1558:1567>|amazon alexa<1590:1602>|alexa<1597:1602>|spend<1606:1611>|hour<1612:1617>|different<1625:1634>|configuration<1635:1649>|share<1653:1658>|amazon alexa<1667:1679>|alexa<1674:1679>|fail<1687:1693>|every time<1694:1704>|set<1722:1725>|device<1741:1747>|device<1741:1748>|install<1755:1762>|alexa<1773:1778>|amazon alexa<1766:1778>|separately<1779:1789>|device<1801:1807>|device<1801:1808>|install<1816:1823>|instal<1816:1825>|share<1830:1835>|share<1830:1836>|google<1842:1848>|home<1849:1853>|google home<1842:1853>|once<1855:1859>|set<1875:1878>|setup<1875:1880>|voice<1885:1890>|voice command<1885:1899>|command<1891:1899>|automation<1904:1915>|perfectly<1928:1937>|give<1939:1944>|pro<1964:1967>|improve<1962:1969>|matter<1976:1982>|support<1983:1990>|matter support<1976:1990>|device<1995:2001>",

Unlike a normal light switch where “up” is ALWAYS on and “down” is ALWAYS off, this device has single button on/off button.This becomes an issue with groups of light switches in the same room, when you want to turn them all off - for instance at the end of the night.With separate on/off (which we are all used to) you simply flip them all down without looking, and all lights go off whether there was originally one light on or all lights on.Where there is a singular on/off button, you have to “think” about which lights are on or off before hitting the button.In my room, where we have separate switches for the recessed light, sconces, and pendant lights, I find myself turning lights on when I meant to turn them off.  I wish I had bought Lutron, which has separate on/off buttons so I would always turn lights off when I meant to turn them off.###major<7:12>|one major<3:12>|design<13:19>|flaw<20:24>|design flaw<13:24>|big<29:32>|design<33:39>|flaw<40:44>|design flaw<33:44>|normal<56:62>|a normal light<54:68>|normal light switch<56:75>|always<90:96>|down<105:109>|always<114:120>|device<131:137>|single<142:148>|single button<142:155>|button<149:155>|button<163:169>|become<175:182>|issue<186:191>|an issue<183:191>|group<197:203>|same<229:233>|room<234:238>|turn<257:261>|all<267:270>|instance<281:289>|end<297:300>|night<308:313>|separate<319:327>|all<349:352>|simply<366:372>|flip<373:377>|all<383:386>|down<387:391>|all<413:416>|all<455:458>|originally<449:459>|all<476:479>|button<523:529>|hit<591:598>|button<603:609>|room<616:620>|separate<636:644>|recessed<662:670>|end<692:695>|pendant<691:698>|pendant light<691:705>|find<709:713>|turn<721:725>|turn<721:728>|mean<746:751>|turn<755:759>|wish<773:777>|lutron<791:797>|separate<809:817>|button<825:831>|button<825:832>|always<844:850>|turn<851:855>|mean<874:879>|turn<883:887>",

Only thing bad is the blink when adjusted to full brightness</b> This worked as expected.  It was bought to be able to have more control on the lighting when away for security. If you're away on a trip, you can create a profile on the app and control the light turn on/off times, and brightness levelsWhat I like about it is that it is capable of being programmed via the app. The app has improved over the years. Note I've had the Kasa Smart brand for my  wall outlet plugs and have 0 issues with it. My porch light has a one as well which works good.What I don't like is the feel.. I'm so use for  up to on, and down to be off. This switch (and other Kasa switches) have a single down press. I just wish they could have made the whole thing as a push button so it doen't feel weird needing to push down when turning on the lights.What I really don't like is the blinking of the lights when you set it to full power by pressing the button. I'm guessing that blink it to say it is at full power.. but it is annoying.. Blink the switch led.. not the main light.Dimmer features are much more course than an analog switch, but it is good enough. Interesting thing about this switch for brightness is that you can set what you consider \"100%\" lighting so it never goes over that. I haven't tested this feature but I found it interesting they gave this feature.Installing the switch was not difficult, but be sure to read the instructions and review instructions on how light switches are to be installed. It can get confusing sometimes.Synching the switch to the network and to the phone was easy. Since it was a first time install, it was blinking, which indicates that it is ready to be synchronized/connected. I didn't look on this switch, but my other Kasa switch had a resynch button in case you need to resynch it, so look in your instructions if you need to do this.Synching just required that I turn on my app and go through the motion of adding  a new device.  It steps you through the process.  Within the app you can control the brightness, On/Off, turn off timer, and schedule/program the on/off times. One thing I really liked about the Kasa was the capability of scheduling it to turn on at sunset and turn off on sunrise as a setting. This means I don't need to look up when the sunrises or sets.I know this is suppose to be able to integrate with Alexa and Google, but I haven't test this feature.###pretty<12:18>|blink<47:52>|adjust<58:66>|full<70:74>|brightness<75:85>|full brightness<70:85>|able<136:140>|control<154:161>|lighting<169:177>|away<183:187>|security<192:200>|away<212:216>|trip<222:226>|create<236:242>|profile<245:252>|control<268:275>|turn<286:290>|brightness<309:319>|able<364:368>|capable<361:368>|program<378:385>|program<378:388>|improve<414:422>|year<432:437>|note<439:443>|kasa<457:461>|the kasa smart<453:467>|kasa smart<457:467>|smart<462:467>|brand<468:473>|wall<482:486>|outlet<487:493>|plugs<494:499>|issue<511:517>|porch<530:535>|porch light<530:541>|feel<602:606>|down<639:643>|kasa<678:682>|other kasa switch<672:689>|other kasa switch<672:691>|single<700:706>|down<707:711>|press<712:717>|wish<726:730>|whole<756:761>|push<773:777>|button<778:784>|feel<798:802>|weird<803:808>|push<820:824>|down<825:829>|turn<835:839>|turn<835:842>|blink<889:894>|blink<889:897>|set<921:924>|full<931:935>|power<936:941>|press<945:950>|press<945:953>|button<958:964>|guess<970:978>|blink<984:989>|full<1009:1013>|power<1014:1019>|annoying<1032:1040>|blink<1043:1048>|lead<1060:1063>|main<1074:1078>|dimmer<1085:1091>|feature<1092:1099>|feature<1092:1100>|course<1115:1121>|analog<1130:1136>|brightness<1208:1218>|set<1235:1238>|consider<1248:1256>|lighting<1264:1272>|never<1279:1284>|test<1311:1315>|test<1311:1317>|feature<1323:1330>|find<1337:1342>|give<1363:1367>|feature<1373:1380>|instal<1381:1391>|difficult<1411:1420>|read<1437:1441>|instruction<1446:1458>|instruction<1470:1482>|install<1515:1522>|instal<1515:1524>|lead<1521:1524>|confusing<1537:1546>|sometimes<1547:1556>|network<1584:1591>|phone<1603:1608>|easy<1613:1617>|first<1634:1639>|first time<1634:1644>|install<1645:1652>|blink<1661:1666>|blink<1661:1669>|indicate<1677:1686>|read<1698:1702>|ready<1698:1703>|connect<1723:1732>|kasa<1777:1781>|other kasa switch<1771:1788>|button<1803:1809>|case<1813:1817>|instruction<1858:1870>|require<1908:1916>|turn<1924:1928>|motion<1958:1964>|add<1968:1974>|new<1978:1981>|device<1982:1988>|step<1994:1999>|process<2016:2023>|control<2049:2056>|brightness<2061:2071>|turn<2081:2085>|timer<2090:2095>|schedule<2101:2109>|program<2110:2117>|kasa<2171:2175>|capability<2184:2194>|schedule<2198:2208>|turn<2215:2219>|sunset<2226:2232>|set<2229:2232>|turn<2237:2241>|sunrise<2249:2256>|set<2262:2265>|setting<2262:2269>|mean<2276:2281>|sunrise<2315:2322>|sunrise<2315:2323>|set<2327:2330>|set<2327:2331>|suppose<2347:2354>|able<2361:2365>|integrate<2369:2378>|alexa<2384:2389>|google<2394:2400>|test<2416:2420>|feature<2426:2433>",

      "Push on lower edge for both on and off###push<0:4>|low<8:13>|edge<14:18>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★☆☆ [2020-07-15] <b>Great Switches but...</b> Overall I'm impressed by the switches and design, they were easy to install, and they are working well. But I'd highlight two issues:1. The switch design where you push on the lower edge for both on and off takes some getting used to. The challenge becomes when you have some \"dumb\" switches that toggle up for on and down for off, mixed with these that are down for both. My preference is to change every switch to a smart switch, even where it's not needed, but that's not cheap.2. The smart actions, especially the auto off feature, is limited to three total actions. No idea why this is capped, likely a development challenge, but other switch options (leviton, lutron) don't have this limit. What this means in practice is if I have 4 bathroom fans i want to turn off automatically after 60 mins on, 2 closet lights that should turn off after 15 minutes, and automatically schedule the evening light scheme, i have to pick up to three and miss out on the rest.On #1, this is the design, something to think about. But for #2, I have another 20 switches to convert but refuse to buy more until Kasa addresses this limit. I've commented on a forum a week ago with no response. Hopefully they'll see here and prioritize expansion of this feature.###switches<9:17>|overall<29:36>|design<71:77>|easy<89:93>|install<97:104>|design<176:182>|push<193:197>|low<205:210>|edge<211:215>|challenge<268:277>|become<278:285>|dumb<306:310>|toggle<326:332>|down<347:351>|mix<361:366>|down<387:391>|change<422:428>|smart<447:452>|smart<517:522>|smart action<517:530>|action<523:530>|especially<532:542>|auto<547:551>|feature<556:563>|limit<568:573>|limit<568:575>|total<585:590>|action<591:598>|idea<603:607>|cap<620:626>|likely<628:634>|challenge<649:658>|option<677:684>|leviton<686:693>|lutron<695:701>|limit<719:724>|mean<736:741>|bathroom<769:777>|bathroom fan<769:782>|fan<778:782>|turn<793:797>|auto<802:806>|automatically<802:815>|min<825:829>|closet<836:842>|turn<862:866>|minute<880:887>|15 minute<877:887>|auto<893:897>|automatically<893:906>|schedule<907:915>|evening<920:927>|pick<952:956>|miss<973:977>|rest<989:993>|the rest<985:993>|design<1013:1019>|convert<1089:1096>|refuse<1101:1107>|kasa<1126:1130>|address<1131:1140>|limit<1146:1151>|comment<1158:1167>|forum<1173:1178>|week<1181:1185>|ago<1186:1189>|no response<1195:1206>|response<1198:1206>|hopefully<1208:1217>|feature<1268:1275>",

But it keep failing to add device. After connecting all wires as per instructions. I see orange and green wifi blinking, opened app, connected to tp link wifi and it takes about 2-3 mins trying to find device and eventually fails. Tried at two different location. Phone and switch are very close like next to each other. Now I can't return this since return window is closed. Support is not much helpful. They keep saying my wifi is not 2.4GHz. I said I have connected other devices which also requires 2.4GHz. And Wifi SSID I added to my router is 2.4Ghz. I highly recommend not to buy this product. It is waste of time and energy.Also it does  not fit  in if you trying to replace one of the switch in 2 or more gang switch box. It is bit bigger than the std switches and later cover plate wont fit properly. It covers the tiny switches of this switch at the bottom (reset and restart). Bottom line it looks ugly after putting cover plate of two or more gang switch box.###smart<41:46>|follow<58:66>|instruction<67:78>|keep<87:91>|fail<92:99>|add<103:106>|device<107:113>|connect<121:131>|wire<136:141>|instruction<149:160>|instruction<149:161>|orange<169:175>|green<180:185>|wifi<186:190>|link<192:196>|blink<191:199>|open<201:207>|connect<213:222>|tp<226:228>|link<229:233>|wifi<234:238>|min<262:266>|find<277:281>|device<282:288>|eventually<293:303>|fail<304:309>|different<324:333>|location<334:342>|phone<344:349>|close<370:375>|next<381:385>|now<401:404>|return<413:419>|return<431:437>|return window<431:444>|window<438:444>|close<448:453>|close<448:454>|support<456:463>|helpful<476:483>|keep<490:494>|wifi<505:509>|connect<539:548>|device<555:561>|device<555:562>|require<574:582>|wifi<595:599>|ssid<600:604>|add<607:610>|add<607:612>|router<619:625>|highly<639:645>|recommend<646:655>|waste<687:692>|waste of time<687:700>|energy<705:711>|fit<730:733>|replace<755:762>|gang<794:798>|box<806:809>|gang switch box<794:809>|big<821:827>|later<854:859>|cover<860:865>|plate<866:871>|cover plate<860:871>|fit<877:880>|properly<881:889>|cover<894:899>|cover<894:900>|bottom<941:947>|reset<949:954>|restart<959:966>|bottom<969:975>|line<976:980>|ugly<990:994>|put<1001:1008>|cover<1009:1014>|plate<1015:1020>|cover plate<1009:1020>|gang<1036:1040>|gang switch box<1036:1051>|box<1048:1051>",
      "Plain switches lack easily accessible reset button###plain<0:5>|lack<15:19>|easily<20:26>|reset<38:43>|button<44:50>|reset button<38:50>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★★☆ [2021-07-09] <b>Used for nearly every switch in my house.</b> I have some version of these switches controlling nearly everything in my house.  I started replacing my switches a few years ago with the Gen1 switches and just recently finished out with the Gen2.  The only switches that aren't these are my bathroom exhaust fans.  I've written quite a lot here so congrats if you make it through to the end.The switches I have in use now are:DW6HD (Gen1 600W Dimmer)DW1KD (1000W Dimmer, Gen1 but still uses leads instead of screws)DW15S (Gen1 Switch)DW4SF (Gen1 4 Speed Fan Controller, also uses leads over screws)D26HD (Gen2 600W Dimmer)D215S (Gen2 Switch)DAWDC (Gen2 wireless dimmer companion)DAWSC (Gen2 wireless switch companion)Overall I am very happy with my switches.  I have not had issues with constant dropping as some have said here.  The app works well and I really like the Away feature in it though the same can be accomplished through Alexa.  Integration with Alexa works fine.  Alexa usually picks up a new switch and let's me know it's connected before I can finish entering the name I want for the device.  That's not an issue as it updates automatically once I enter the name I like.  They also integrate well with Samsung SmartThings.  I use that as I was accidentally sent some ZWave Leviton switches when I ordered WiFi ones so I put them to use rather than throwing them away as Amazon suggested.  I also really like that for anyone visiting they work just as you'd expect a normal switch to vs using something like smart bulbs where if the power gets cut things can go a bit funny.  My OCD also likes that these don't stick out/lean one way or the other when switched on/off.  They're very unassuming looking which to me is good.My house is only a few years old, none of the switch boxes are metal and just about everywhere has a neutral wire already in the box.  The only places I had issues were in some of the 3-way switches where whoever wired the house seemed to cut some corners and didn't run all the wiring these require, along with not keeping things in their standard place (e.g. red wire hot, black wire traveler, etc.)  so for a while some of my 3-way switches weren't 3-way.  The Gen2 wireless switch companions remedied this though.Like many others, in general I prefer the screw terminals.  However, there were a couple of instances where having the leads was handy.  For the neutral wire I did like using the lead as it is more flexible than cutting a piece of 14/2 and using that.  In my kitchen dual gang box, which was very crowded even before I changed the switches, it did actually save me some space as I could get rid of the extra rigid wiring and use the existing wire nut already in the box on the house neutrals so I wasn't adding anything.  The other instance I preferred the leads was in a bedroom.  Whoever wired the boxes liked to strip a portion of the hot wire, loop that around the hot terminal on the switch and then terminate the hot wire on the second switch in the box rather than using a wire nut with two leads coming off of it.  Both switches were connected on a continuous hot wire.  I was able to cut the wire down to the stripped part and then just nut both switch hot/black wires to the house hot wire.  The looping method they used is a pain with the screw terminals on the Gen1, but I've made it work before.  The leads made that easier however, overall I would prefer the screw terminals.The wireless switch/dimmer companions are awesome.  They solved my 3-way wiring issue and are super easy to setup.  I was afraid there may be some delay after pushing the rocker, but it's an instant response.  If you're using Gen2 switches and wish you had a 3-way light somewhere you don't these make a really easy fix for that especially since you can stick them to a bare wall with the included adhesive pads.  Hopefully the battery life lives up to the stated 5 years, but I won't hold my breath.I also really like the fan controllers.  I have pull chain ceiling fans without remotes in all bedrooms and the living room and these make it really to control the fan speed either with the switch itself, voice, or an app.  Much better than my short wife trying to stand on something to pull the chain.Gen1 vs Gen2As stated above, overall I like the screw terminals better than the leads on the Gen 2.Updating the switch firmware is easier on Gen2.  In the My Leviton app you can choose to Update All Gen2 switches at once.  For Gen1 switches you have to do them individually still.  Gets old fast when you have a lot of them.  The addition of the wireless switch companions for Gen2 is great.  I don't use Apple Homekit so I can't speak to how Gen2 works there.ISSUESMost of the issues I've encountered have been more the fault of the house wiring or some other external factor rather than an issue with any of the switches themselves, but they're not without fault.-- Some LED bulbs just don't play nice with the dimmers.  Maybe this is my fault for trying the less expensive bulbs, but I've noticed the EcoSmart from Home Depot don't always dim very well.  Other brands work better, but I have yet to find an LED bulb/switch combo that gives 1) the dimming range or 2) dimming smoothness and 3) no flicker on dimmer settings than 100% of an incandescent bulb.  You can get one or two, but not all 3.-- I have had some disconnects.  I haven't had enough that I'd call it unusable or a deal breaker, but it happens. Most things with wifi will sometimes drop.  This is much easier to deal with on the dimmer switches since you can pull out the bottom dimmer rocker and it cuts power to the switch effectively letting you reset its connection.  I wish the plain switches had something similar where I could cut their power without having to flip a breaker.  Honestly, when a non-dimmer isn't connected I don't do anything.  It'll eventually reconnect but sometimes it's a day and sometimes it's a few days.  If there was an easily accessible reset button on the plain switch that would make things so much easier.--  I have had 1 switch (out of 26) just up and die on me... so far any way.  It was in my super crowded kitchen dual gang box which I think contributed to its death.  However, and this is a plus, Leviton support was great.  They walked me through some steps (which I had already tried, but I understand they need to check their boxes) and then they sent me a new switch.  It was all handled very well, no run around or anything.  Also, since it was a Gen1 switch that has been discontinued they replaced it with a Gen2 equivalent.Overall I am very pleased with the switches and how they operate day to day.  If the one hadn't died and they could address the resets on the plain switches I'd give them 5 stars all day.  I'm not sure who to blame for the dimming, if it's Leviton or LED bulbs in general so for the moment I won't hold that against them.  Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.###nearly<12:18>|house<38:43>|version<61:68>|control<87:94>|control<87:98>|nearly<99:105>|house<123:128>|start<133:140>|replace<141:150>|year<169:174>|few

I love the schedule feature, and the dimmable feature. I use this to turn flood lights on in the night at 50% brightness to deter unwanted trespassers.Some people complained that there is a light on the HS220 switch that glows when the switch is off. This is true, but it’s not a very bright glow at all, just barely as bright as the newest Apple Watch when you put it into “always on” mode. The good news is that you are able to turn off the little light from the Kasa app.As far as the humming sounds people claim about the switch or bulbs, I’ve not noticed any buzzing from the switch or bulbs I’m using. I’m using four ecosmart LED bulbs (65 watt replacement, dimmable, model BR30 flood lights from Home Depot)Scheduling times to turn the switch on and off used to be finicky and not work at all, but I was informed by support via email that the HS220 should be factory reset by pressing the hidden reset button for 10 seconds. I then setup the switch to wifi and this fixed the scheduling issue.Support via email was good. Took a little long to solve the issue with the scheduling but the issue was solved regardless. I’m satisfied.Might get a few more for my bedroom and living room…MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A NEUTRAL WIRE IN YOUR LIGHT SWITCH BOX!###device<25:31>|lead<64:67>|love<78:82>|schedule<87:95>|feature<96:103>|dimmable<113:121>|able<117:121>|feature<122:129>|turn<145:149>|flood<150:155>|flood light<150:162>|night<173:178>|bright<186:192>|brightness<186:196>|some people<227:238>|people<232:238>|complain<239:249>|glow<297:301>|glow<297:302>|bright<361:367>|glow<368:372>|all<376:379>|barely<386:392>|bright<396:402>|new<410:416>|apple<417:422>|watch<423:428>|put<438:441>|always<451:457>|mode<462:466>|news<477:481>|able<498:502>|turn<506:510>|kasa<541:545>|kasa app<541:549>|the kasa app<537:549>|far<553:556>|sound<572:578>|people<579:585>|claim<586:591>|bulb<612:617>|notice<628:635>|buzzing<640:647>|bulb<667:672>|ecosmart<699:707>|lead<708:711>|bulb<712:717>|watt<722:726>|replacement<727:738>|dimmable<740:748>|able<744:748>|mode<750:754>|model<750:755>|flood<761:766>|flood light<761:773>|home<779:783>|turn<810:814>|all<872:875>|support<899:906>|email<911:916>|factory<942:949>|reset<950:955>|press<959:967>|hide<972:978>|reset<979:984>|reset button<979:991>|button<985:991>|second<999:1006>|10 second<996:1006>|setup<1015:1020>|wifi<1035:1039>|fix<1049:1054>|scheduling<1059:1069>|issue<1070:1075>|support<1076:1083>|email<1088:1093>|long<1118:1122>|solve<1126:1131>|issue<1136:1141>|scheduling<1151:1161>|issue<1170:1175>|solve<1180:1185>|solve<1180:1186>|regardless<1187:1197>|satisfied<1203:1212>|bedroom<1241:1248>|room<1244:1248>|living<1253:1259>|room<1260:1264>|living room<1253:1264>|neutral<1286:1293>|wire<1294:1298>|a neutral wire<1284:1298>|neutral wire<1286:1298>|box<1320:1323>",

It's a bit like a GFCI outlet, though- they are fairly bulky, so there's not going to be a lot of spare room in the box.  It can be tricky to get two of these into a duplex box. (Waygo's, or very, very neat wiring are your friend)We use these with Google Home, and they work very well. The only complaint I have about the integration is setting them up twice- once in the Kasa app, and then again in Google Home. It would be great if the setup process were all in one place and just flowed through. For example, when i have \"Living Room\" in both apps, Google Home should realize that I've set up a switch in Kasa and automatically assign it to \"Living Room\" in Google. I realize that is on Google- it's just something that should be addressed.Once it is integrated, though, you can mimic a much more expensive home automation system. I've seen homes with $30k-$50K just on home automation. These switches do a darn good job of mirroring that, and they don't require a server to run them. We've set up \"scenes\" like \"Hey Google, it's time for movies\"- and then Google can address the various switches and dim the lights, close the blinds, etc. It's quite a luxurious feeling.What I particularly like about these switches is that they stay connected to our wifi pretty well. I've experimented with several other brands, and some of them will drop off the wifi on an annoyingly frequent basis. I want to install, then not think about it again. In my primary residence, we have >30 switched that have been running for about a year. Only one has ever needed to be reconnected to wifi, and that has only happened once so far. (btw, reconnecting is relatively easy, as there are reset buttons carefully hidden on the front of the device- you don't have to take it out of the wall).So all in, electronics are well designed, installation is about what you'd expect, and integration with Google Home is pretty good.  Kasa has done a very nice job with these switches.###value<13:18>|google<36:42>|install<52:59>|instal<52:61>|smart<84:89>|these smart switch<78:98>|ever<107:111>|property<114:124>|price<125:130>|par<150:153>|lutron<159:165>|dumb<167:171>|big<202:205>|box<206:209>|big box<202:209>|store<210:215>|box store<206:215>|functionality<239:252>|installation<253:265>|straightforward<269:284>|familiar<296:304>|basic<310:315>|electrical<316:326>|gfci<351:355>|outlet<356:362>|though<364:370>|fairly<381:387>|bulky<388:393>|par<432:435>|room<437:441>|box<449:452>|tricky<465:471>|box<506:509>|neat<535:539>|wiring<540:546>|google<581:587>|home<588:592>|google home<581:592>|only complaint<623:637>|complaint<628:637>|integration<655:666>|set<670:673>|set<670:677>|once<693:697>|kasa<705:709>|kasa app<705:713>|the kasa app<701:713>|again<724:729>|google<733:739>|google home<733:744>|home<740:744>|set<771:774>|setup<771:776>|process<777:784>|setup process<771:784>|place<801:806>|example<836:843>|living<858:864>|room<865:869>|living room<858:869>|google<885:891>|home<892:896>|google home<885:896>|realize<904:911>|set<922:925>|kasa<941:945>|automatically<950:963>|living<978:984>|room<985:989>|living room<978:989>|google<994:1000>|realize<1004:1011>|google<1023:1029>|address<1066:1073>|address<1066:1075>|once<1076:1080>|integrate<1087:1097>|though<1099:1105>|expensive<1133:1142>|home<1143:1147>|home automation<1143:1158>|automation<1148:1158>|automation system<1148:1165>|system<1159:1165>|home automation system<1143:1165>|home<1177:1181>|home<1177:1182>|home<1206:1210>|automation<1211:1221>|home automation<1206:1221>|job<1253:1256>|require<1291:1298>|server<1301:1307>|run<1311:1314>|set<1327:1330>|scene<1335:1341>|google<1353:1359>|google<1393:1399>|address<1404:1411>|various<1416:1423>|dim<1437:1440>|close<1453:1458>|blind<1463:1469>|feeling<1499:1506>|par<1514:1517>|particularly<1514:1526>|stay<1566:1570>|connected<1571:1580>|wifi<1588:1592>|pretty<1593:1599>|ever<1630:1634>|brand<1643:1649>|other brand<1637:1649>|drop<1673:1677>|wifi<1686:1690>|annoyingly<1697:1707>|frequent<1708:1716>|install<1734:1741>|again<1767:1772>|primary<1780:1787>|run<1835:1838>|run<1835:1842>|year<1855:1859>|ever<1874:1878>|connected<1894:1903>|reconnecte<1892:1903>|wifi<1907:1911>|happen<1931:1939>|once<1940:1944>|far<1948:1951>|btw<1954:1957>|reconnecte<1959:1971>|relatively<1975:1985>|easy<1986:1990>|reset<2005:2010>|set<2007:2010>|reset button<2005:2018>|button<2011:2018>|carefully<2019:2028>|hide<2029:2035>|front<2043:2048>|electronic<2118:2129>|design<2139:2147>|install<2149:2156>|installation<2149:2161>|integration<2194:2205>|integration with google<2194:2217>|google<2211:2217>|home<2218:2222>|google home<2211:2222>|pretty<2226:2232>|kasa<2240:2244>|job<2266:2269>",

The reason I got these was because these will remember the previous dimmer setting when turned on, whereas the Caseta goes to full bright each time unless you have the remote.  LED bulbs can be too bright for most occasions so it's nice to have that feature.  What I don't like is when these are on a bank of several switches and some lights are on and some are off, it's hard to determine from the switch which ones to turn off.  They have a slight white lighted ring when off, and nothing when they're on (and when a few lights are on, it's hard to see which switches have the white ring).  The dimming indicator turns off after a few seconds.  It'd be nice if the dimming indicator stayed on all the time so it's easy to tell which switches are on and which are off.  I'm hoping this can be done with a firmware update in the future.  Other than that, the quality is a little a cheaper feeling than Lutron, but they do look great and easier to hit just the one button rather than finding the on-button (vs off or dim) on the Caseta.###compare<47:54>|lutron<67:73>|lutron caseta<67:80>|caseta<74:80>|the rest<105:113>|rest<109:113>|house<121:126>|reason<133:139>|remember<175:183>|previous<188:196>|dim<197:200>|dimmer<197:203>|setting<204:211>|turn<217:221>|turn<217:223>|caseta<240:246>|full<255:259>|bright<260:266>|remote<297:303>|lead<306:309>|bulb<310:315>|bright<327:333>|most<338:342>|occasion<343:352>|feature<379:386>|bank<430:434>|hard<501:505>|determine<509:518>|one<541:544>|one<541:545>|turn<549:553>|slight<572:578>|hit<580:583>|white<579:584>|ring<593:597>|hard<672:676>|hit<709:712>|white<708:713>|ring<714:718>|dim<726:729>|dim<726:733>|indicator<734:743>|turn<744:748>|turn<744:749>|a few second<760:773>|second<766:773>|few second<762:773>|dim<796:799>|dim<796:803>|indicator<804:813>|stay<814:820>|easy<845:849>|hope<904:910>|one<924:927>|firmware<935:943>|update<944:950>|a firmware update<933:950>|firmware update<935:950>|future<958:964>|cheap<1010:1017>|feeling<1018:1025>|lutron<1031:1037>|easy<1066:1072>|hit<1076:1079>|one<1089:1092>|button<1093:1099>|find<1112:1119>|button<1127:1133>|dim<1145:1148>|caseta<1157:1163>",

They still don’t work perfectly and the bulbs still do still flicker a little at specific dimmer levels; but still better than other dimmer switches I have tried.- After rebooting my router, I have no issues with reconnections- Great integration with Home Assistant and Samsung SmartThings and can be cycled without an internet connectionCons:- No three-way option yet and you can only group up to 3 sets of switches in the Kaza app to mimic this function.  The workaround for this is to use Samsung SmartThings app which has equal if not better response time than Kasa’s native app.  I use the HS200 and HS220 with SmartThings to mimic a three way dimmer configuration.  In reality the HS220 controls the lights and the HS200 is powered but not connected to any lights directly.  The downside to this configuration is only the dimmer switch works manually without internet.  Response time between the switches is about 1 to 2 seconds using SmartThings or the Kasa app- I have had to reset one of my 23 devices in the past 6 months; however, that was as simple as pressing the reset button which just power cycles it, all setting are still saved- The dimmers have had a weird behavior that has happened twice where you turn them off, the switch will register as off including the indicator light on the switch itself, but the lights will still be on.  You have to press the switch again to “turn the light on” and then off again.  Again this has happened two times over several hundred cycles.###mostly<3:9>|currently<22:31>|dimmer<48:54>|these dimmer switch<42:63>|instal<64:73>|personally<78:88>|dimmer<112:118>|option<119:125>|feit<144:148>|recess<149:157>|led<158:162>|tp<171:173>|link<174:178>|the tp link<167:178>|tp link<171:178>|deco<179:183>|router<187:193>|brand<220:225>|affordable<264:274>|name<293:297>|name brand<293:303>|brand<298:303>|z wave<322:328>|wave<324:328>|easy<340:344>|relatively<367:377>|feit<388:392>|bulb<393:398>|feit bulb<388:398>|find<412:417>|still<444:449>|perfectly<461:470>|bulb<479:484>|still<485:490>|still<494:499>|flicker<500:507>|specific<520:528>|dimmer<529:535>|level<536:542>|still<548:553>|dimmer<572:578>|reboot<609:618>|router<622:628>|issue<640:646>|no issue<637:646>|integration<673:684>|home<690:694>|assistant<695:704>|home assistant<690:704>|samsung<709:716>|samsung smartthings<709:728>|smartthings<717:728>|cycle<740:746>|internet<758:766>|three way<787:796>|option<797:803>|yet<804:807>|group<825:830>|set<839:843>|function<886:894>|workaround<901:911>|samsung<931:938>|samsung smartthings<931:950>|smartthings<939:950>|response<985:993>|response time<985:998>|kasa<1004:1008>|native<1011:1017>|native app<1011:1021>|smartthings<1055:1066>|three way<1078:1087>|dimmer<1088:1094>|configuration<1095:1108>|control<1132:1140>|power<1169:1174>|connect<1185:1194>|directly<1209:1217>|downside<1224:1232>|configuration<1241:1254>|dimmer<1267:1273>|manually<1287:1295>|internet<1304:1312>|response<1315:1323>|response time<1315:1328>|2 second<1364:1373>|second<1366:1373>|smartthings<1380:1391>|kasa<1399:1403>|reset<1423:1428>|device<1442:1449>|past<1457:1461>|6 month<1462:1470>|month<1464:1470>|however<1472:1479>|simple<1493:1499>|press<1503:1508>|press<1503:1511>|reset<1516:1521>|button<1522:1528>|the reset button<1512:1528>|reset button<1516:1528>|power<1540:1545>|cycle<1546:1552>|setting<1561:1568>|still<1573:1578>|dimmer<1590:1596>|dimmer<1590:1597>|weird<1609:1614>|behavior<1615:1623>|happen<1633:1641>|twice<1642:1647>|turn<1658:1662>|register<1689:1697>|include<1705:1714>|indicator<1719:1728>|indicator light<1719:1734>|still<1777:1782>|press<1803:1808>|again<1820:1825>|turn<1830:1834>|again<1862:1867>|again<1870:1875>|happen<1885:1893>|cycle<1925:1931>",
      "Natural press top for on, bottom for off###press<8:13>|top<14:17>|bottom<26:32>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★★☆ [2024-06-07] <b>WAIT if you want full Matter support vs. this HomeKit native switch</b> It worked great for my HomeKit use.... ignore ALL of the Leviton instructions and just \"add accessory\" when you are in the room you want to add the switch to in the iOS \"Home\" app. You don't need to use the Leviton app, but you will be at version 1.4 of the firmware, which works fine. I did load up the Leviton app and run through the Leviton gauntlet to use the app WITHOUT creating an account by telling the Leviton app you just want to use with Apple HomeKit and Siri and NOT use it with other integrations tied to an account with Leviton. I say WAIT for full Matter support because once these are delivered with the Matter firmware, you will NOT have to create a Leviton account, which is currently required to install the early adopter Matter firmware. It makes sense that Leviton requires an account to install the Matter firmware because your account will save the all important Matter QR code that your device will be unusable without once you update to Matter. Eventually the Matter QR codes will be attached to the switch and it will not require fooling around with yet another app, just use your Matter controller and off you go.But for my current use, the HomeKit native use was great. The Leviton build is superior to my ReFoss, partly due to a \"rocker\" momentary dual contact switch vs. the ReFoss which has a single momentary contact that you press the bottom of the switch to both turn On and Off while the Leviton has the more natural press the top for on, the bottom for off. As an added benefit when wired 3 way, pressing the top will be ON vs. the normal problem with mechanical 3 way switches that flip back and forth between up/down for on/off.So far my economy Refoss has been fine, but I'd probably go with the tp-link tapo for an economy Matter over WiFi.I had a neutral wire to support the higher power use of a WiFi switch. This WiFi Leviton Decora is probably a step down from the Lutron Caseta, but simpler to use where I don't have a ZigBee or Lutron Clear Connect RF hub handy.###wait<3:7>|full<20:24>|matter<25:31>|matter support<25:39>|support<32:39>|home<49:53>|homekit<49:56>|native<57:63>|home<98:102>|homekit<98:105>|ignore<114:120>|leviton<132:139>|instruction<140:152>|add<163:166>|accessory<167:176>|room<198:202>|add<215:218>|home<245:249>|leviton<282:289>|leviton app<282:293>|the leviton app<278:293>|version<314:321>|firmware<333:341>|load<367:371>|leviton<379:386>|leviton app<379:390>|the leviton app<375:390>|run<395:398>|leviton<411:418>|create<451:459>|account<463:470>|an account<460:470>|leviton<486:493>|leviton app<486:497>|the leviton app<482:497>|apple<524:529>|home<530:534>|homekit<530:537>|apple homekit<524:537>|siri<542:546>|integration<573:585>|tie<586:590>|account<597:604>|an account<594:604>|leviton<610:617>|wait<625:629>|full<634:638>|matter<639:645>|support<646:653>|matter support<639:653>|matter<696:702>|matter firmware<696:711>|firmware<703:711>|the matter firmware<692:711>|create<734:740>|leviton<743:750>|account<751:758>|current<769:776>|currently<769:778>|require<779:786>|require<779:787>|install<791:798>|early<803:808>|matter<817:823>|matter firmware<817:832>|firmware<824:832>|sense<843:848>|leviton<854:861>|require<862:869>|require<862:870>|an account<871:881>|account<874:881>|install<885:892>|matter<897:903>|matter firmware<897:912>|firmware<904:912>|the matter firmware<893:912>|account<926:933>|save<939:943>|important<952:961>|matter<962:968>|qr<969:971>|qr code<969:976>|code<972:976>|device<987:993>|unusable<1002:1010>|update<1028:1034>|matter<1038:1044>|eventually<1046:1056>|matter<1061:1067>|qr<1068:1070>|qr code<1068:1075>|code<1071:1075>|code<1071:1076>|qr code<1068:1076>|attach<1085:1093>|require<1124:1131>|yet<1152:1155>|matter<1183:1189>|controller<1190:1200>|current<1227:1234>|home<1244:1248>|homekit<1244:1251>|native<1252:1258>|leviton<1278:1285>|build<1286:1291>|superior<1295:1303>|rocker<1335:1341>|dual<1353:1357>|contact<1358:1365>|single<1400:1406>|contact<1417:1424>|press<1434:1439>|bottom<1444:1450>|turn<1473:1477>|leviton<1499:1506>|press<1528:1533>|top<1538:1541>|bottom<1554:1560>|add<1576:1579>|add<1576:1581>|benefit<1582:1589>|wire<1595:1599>|wire<1595:1600>|3 way<1601:1606>|press<1608:1613>|press<1608:1616>|top<1621:1624>|normal<1644:1650>|problem<1651:1658>|mechanical<1664:1674>|3 way<1675:1680>|3 way switch<1675:1689>|flip<1695:1699>|back<1700:1704>|forth<1709:1714>|down<1726:1730>|far<1745:1748>|probably<1790:1798>|tp<1811:1813>|tp link<1811:1818>|the tp link<1807:1818>|link<1814:1818>|tapo<1819:1823>|matter<1839:1845>|wifi<1851:1855>|neutral<1864:1871>|wire<1872:1876>|neutral wire<1864:1876>|a neutral wire<1862:1876>|support<1880:1887>|high<1892:1898>|power<1899:1904>|wifi<1914:1918>|wifi<1932:1936>|leviton<1937:1944>|decora<1945:1951>|leviton decora<1937:1951>|probably<1955:1963>|step<1966:1970>|down<1971:1975>|lutron<1985:1991>|caseta<1992:1998>|lutron caseta<1985:1998>|simple<2004:2011>|zigbee<2040:2046>|lutron<2050:2056>|clear<2057:2062>|connect<2063:2070>|hub<2074:2077>|handy<2078:2083>"

      "Deep design###deep<0:4>|design<5:11>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2020-07-12] <b>Work great, alexa likes them. Tight fit in box, read my notes / view pics</b> Around 2005 I installed IR dimmers... But they require a controller... Which is often miss placed. Then I solved the problem in 2013 when I got a Samsung S4 phone... It had an IR blaster and the only reason why I got that phone... By 2016 it was time for a new phone... But no more IR port... Urgh... Moving up into the new decade... Replaced all 3 switches with these Wi-Fi switches. They work great, I already had other kaasa devices so alexa was already paired. I just named each and alexa turns them on or off. In order to dimm you have to say 'Alexa dimm living room lights 50%'. If you just say 'Dimm' it goes down like 5%.If your house is old like 1980s or possibly 90s, your gang boxes may suck like mine. I had the ones with the wings 'old work' and the screw to turn the wings was in the way  for the switch to go in... So a 5 minute job turned to an hour (each) It also helps to get the deepest gang boxes, the lights are a bit deep. See the pictures ofy fun time installing these. (not the lights fault) but if the back was 2mm smaller, it would have worked.My only complaint is that my old switches, you could turn the lights on using the dimmer function, these you can't. They do have lights indicating the level that the dimmer is set to. But I usually dimm all the way down then increase it by 2 clicks and then turn the lights on, else I'll blind whoever I'm trying not to wake up.The dimmer light level goes away when set. A ring glows when the light is off I guess to make it easy to see in the dark.###alexa<15:20>|tight<33:38>|fit<39:42>|tight fit<33:42>|box<46:49>|read<51:55>|note<59:64>|pic<72:76>|instal<95:104>|dimm<108:112>|dimmer<108:114>|dimmer<108:115>|require<128:135>|controller<138:148>|often<161:166>|miss<167:171>|place<172:178>|solve<187:193>|problem<198:205>|samsung<227:234>|phone<238:243>|only reason<276:287>|the only reason<272:287>|reason<281:287>|phone<303:308>|new<338:341>|phone<342:347>|move<382:388>|new<401:404>|place<417:423>|replace<415:423>|wi<450:452>|fi<453:455>|wi fi<450:455>|wi fi switch<450:464>|read<487:491>|already<485:492>|device<509:516>|alexa<520:525>|read<532:536>|already<530:537>|pair<538:544>|name<553:558>|alexa<568:573>|turn<574:578>|turn<574:579>|dimm<608:612>|alexa<630:635>|dimm<636:640>|living<641:647>|room<648:652>|living room<641:652>|dimm<683:687>|down<697:701>|house<718:723>|old<727:730>|possibly<745:753>|gang<764:768>|box<769:772>|box<769:774>|gang box<764:774>|suck<779:783>|one<805:809>|old<826:829>|screw<844:849>|turn<853:857>|minute<918:924>|5 minute<916:924>|job<925:928>|turn<929:933>|turn<929:935>|hour<942:946>|an hour<939:946>|help<962:967>|deep<979:983>|deep<979:986>|gang<987:991>|box<992:995>|box<992:997>|gang box<987:997>|deep<1020:1024>|picture<1034:1042>|fun<1047:1050>|instal<1056:1066>|fault<1090:1095>|back<1108:1112>|small<1121:1128>|only complaint<1154:1168>|complaint<1159:1168>|old<1180:1183>|turn<1204:1208>|dimm<1233:1237>|dimmer<1233:1239>|fun<1240:1243>|the dimmer function<1229:1248>|function<1240:1248>|indicate<1287:1297>|level<1302:1307>|dimm<1317:1321>|dimmer<1317:1323>|set<1327:1330>|usually<1341:1348>|dimm<1349:1353>|down<1366:1370>|increase<1376:1384>|click<1393:1399>|turn<1409:1413>|blind<1439:1444>|wake<1471:1475>|dimm<1483:1487>|dimmer<1483:1489>|level<1496:1501>|away<1507:1511>|set<1517:1520>|ring<1524:1528>|glow<1529:1534>|guess<1559:1564>|easy<1576:1580>|dark<1595:1599>",

Overall, prefer 1st gen</b> This switch would've been 5 stars/awesome, if they had kept the original physical design, which used screw terminals. As others have noted, this comes with wires that need to be wire-nutted in place, which adds a lot of bulk. In my case, There were other connections within my single-gang box, and the addition of three more wire nuts was not possible. If this were the original design, I could've simply dropped in the new switch to the old wires, but instead I had to take everything apart, add larger/bulkier wire nuts in order to accommodate the additional wires, and eventually needed a bigger box. Wifi setup was nice and easy, though. Unfortunately, the negative they introduced with this redesign outweigh the positives. I would've preferred another 1st gen switch, but they don't sell them anymore from the look of things.###lack<3:7>|screw<11:16>|screw terminal<11:26>|terminal<17:26>|ease<36:40>|wifi<44:48>|setup<49:54>|plus<57:61>|overall<63:70>|prefer<72:78>|1st<79:82>|gen<83:86>|1st gen<79:86>|5 star<117:124>|keep<146:150>|original<155:163>|physical<164:172>|design<173:179>|screw<192:197>|terminal<198:207>|screw terminal<192:207>|note<224:229>|wire<247:251>|wire<247:252>|wire<269:273>|wire nut<269:280>|nut<274:280>|place<284:289>|add<297:300>|add<297:301>|case<323:327>|connection<346:357>|single<368:374>|gang<375:379>|single gang<368:379>|gang box<375:383>|box<380:383>|single gang box<368:383>|add<393:396>|addition<393:401>|wire<416:420>|wire nut<416:425>|nut<421:425>|possible<434:442>|original<461:469>|design<470:476>|simply<489:495>|drop<496:503>|new<511:514>|old<529:532>|wire<533:537>|wire<533:538>|instead<544:551>|apart<577:582>|add<584:587>|large<588:594>|wire<603:607>|wire nut<603:612>|nut<608:612>|add<641:644>|addition<641:649>|additional<641:651>|wire<652:656>|wire<652:657>|eventually<663:673>|big<683:689>|big box<683:693>|box<690:693>|wifi<695:699>|setup<700:705>|easy<719:723>|though<725:731>|unfortunately<733:746>|negative<752:760>|design<789:795>|redesign<787:795>|prefer<831:837>|prefer<831:840>|1st<849:852>|1st gen<849:856>|gen<853:856>|1st gen switch<849:863>|sell<880:884>|anymore<890:897>",

This is with a remodel outlet box, results might be different with an old work box. I ground the back of the switch plate to make the plate fit to the wall. I have an expensive smart dimmer in another spot and the mounting plate was thinner so the switch plate fit the wall well.Side note, the privacy policy for using the app is less private than I would like.

I did however decided to get one of the newer 2nd generation switches that (supposedly) supports Matter, figuring it would be more future proof.For starters, the installation wasn't terrible, but wasn't any easier than the Gen 1 switches I have installed before.  Was hoping that the body of the switch would have shrunk a bit making for easier installation in tight switch boxes in our older home.After I got the install done I had a TERRIBLE time getting the switch trim plate on.  The trim plate is two pieces, the first piece (let's call it the base) is screwed onto the switch and the second snaps onto the first.  Well the screws that are provided to attach the base to the switch are very short.  This would not be such a big problem except that the holes don't line up well.  Eventually after much frustration I was able to get it on by backing the screws that held the switch in place but even then it doesn't feel secure.  I sure hope I can use a standard decora trim plate on this switch because I think I'm going to need to replace it.2nd problem was when I went to configure it, I already had the My Leviton app installed on my phone to support my existing switches.  I was able to connect the app to the new switch but was not able to see or select the network I wanted.  After more frustration I discovered that inexplicably Leviton decided to REMOVE support for 5Ghz WiFi networks.  I know that 2.4Ghz only WiFi chips are slightly cheaper than ones that support both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz but this level of feature cutting is a very bad sign.Honestly the primary reason I selected Leviton switches over TP-Link or others was the support for 5Ghz WiFi.  Leviton has deleted their sole competitive advantage over other, less expensive smart switches.Finally, as for the supposed Matter support.  I will admit I don't know a lot about Matter but I did try to use Matter to add it to my Google Home (instead of using the linked connection to the My Leviton app) but was unable to.  Google wanted me to scan a QR code on the box but the only QR coded on the box or in the manuals did not work and neither the box nor the manual said anything at all about Matter support.  So who knows if this device even supports Matter like the listing says it does, in any case I could not get it to work.Honestly, if it wouldn't have been such a PITA to rip this switch out of the wall and return it I would have.I did give 2* instead of 1 because it _does_ work.  I was able to get it connected to my Google Home via the link to My Leviton and am able to control it but it's fallen FAR short of my expectations.###significant<3:14>|downgrade<15:24>|gen<34:37>|remove<50:57>|support<58:65>|wifi<75:79>|already<86:93>|multiple<99:107>|leviton<108:115>|smart<116:121>|leviton smart switch<108:130>|all<135:138>|install<131:138>|instal<131:140>|home<147:151>|install<168:175>|all<172:175>|instal<168:177>|parent<184:191>|house<192:197>|happy<217:222>|recommend<252:263>|multiple<272:280>|people<281:287>|year<297:302>|replace<315:322>|place<317:322>|home<344:348>|smart<356:361>|one<374:377>|one<374:378>|honestly<373:381>|consider<395:403>|other brand<408:419>|brand<414:419>|leviton<428:435>|however<444:451>|decide<452:459>|one<467:470>|new<478:481>|new<478:483>|2nd<484:487>|generation<488:498>|2nd generation<484:498>|suppose<514:522>|support<526:533>|support<526:534>|matter<535:541>|figure<543:551>|future<569:575>|future proof<569:581>|proof<576:581>|all<604:607>|install<600:607>|installation<600:612>|easy<645:651>|gen<661:664>|all<687:690>|install<683:690>|instal<683:692>|hope<706:712>|body<722:726>|easy<776:782>|install<783:790>|all<787:790>|installation<783:795>|easy installation<776:795>|tight<799:804>|box<812:815>|box<812:817>|old<825:830>|old home<825:835>|home<831:835>|install<852:859>|all<856:859>|one<861:864>|trim<906:910>|trim plate<906:916>|plate<911:916>|trim<926:930>|plate<931:936>|trim plate<926:936>|piece<944:949>|piece<944:950>|first<956:961>|piece<962:967>|let<969:972>|all<976:979>|call<975:979>|base<987:991>|screw<996:1003>|second<1028:1034>|snap<1035:1040>|first<1050:1055>|screw<1067:1073>|provide<1083:1091>|attach<1095:1101>|base<1106:1110>|short<1134:1139>|big<1167:1170>|problem<1171:1178>|hole<1195:1200>|line<1207:1211>|all<1228:1231>|eventually<1222:1232>|frustration<1244:1255>|able<1262:1266>|back<1283:1290>|screw<1295:1301>|hold<1307:1311>|place<1326:1331>|feel<1357:1361>|secure<1362:1368>|hope<1378:1382>|standard<1395:1403>|decora<1404:1410>|standard decora<1395:1410>|trim<1411:1415>|trim plate<1411:1421>|plate<1416:1421>|replace<1474:1481>|place<1476:1481>|2nd<1485:1488>|problem<1489:1496>|configure<1516:1525>|already<1532:1539>|leviton<1551:1558>|leviton app<1551:1562>|all<1567:1570>|install<1563:1570>|instal<1563:1572>|one<1581:1584>|phone<1579:1584>|support<1588:1595>|exist<1599:1607>|able<1625:1629>|connect<1633:1640>|new<1656:1659>|able<1679:1683>|select<1694:1700>|network<1705:1712>|frustration<1735:1746>|discover<1749:1759>|leviton<1778:1785>|decide<1786:1793>|remove<1797:1803>|support<1804:1811>|wifi<1821:1825>|network<1826:1833>|wifi network<1821:1834>|network<1826:1834>|wifi<1861:1865>|slightly<1876:1884>|cheap<1885:1892>|one<1898:1901>|one<1898:1902>|support<1908:1915>|level<1946:1951>|feature<1955:1962>|sign<1985:1989>|one<1991:1994>|one<1991:1995>|honestly<1990:1998>|primary<2003:2010>|reason<2011:2017>|select<2020:2026>|select<2020:2028>|leviton<2029:2036>|tp<2051:2053>|link<2054:2058>|tp link<2051:2058>|support<2077:2084>|wifi<2094:2098>|leviton<2101:2108>|let<2115:2118>|delete<2113:2120>|less<2166:2170>|expensive<2171:2180>|smart<2181:2186>|all<2199:2202>|finally<2196:2203>|suppose<2216:2224>|matter<2225:2231>|support<2232:2239>|matter support<2225:2239>|admit<2249:2254>|matter<2280:2286>|matter<2308:2314>|add<2318:2321>|google<2331:2337>|home<2338:2342>|google home<2331:2342>|instead<2344:2351>|link<2365:2369>|link<2365:2371>|connect<2372:2379>|connection<2372:2382>|leviton<2393:2400>|leviton app<2393:2404>|unable<2414:2420>|able<2416:2420>|google<2426:2432>|scan<2446:2450>|qr<2453:2455>|a qr code<2451:2460>|qr code<2453:2460>|code<2456:2460>|box<2468:2471>|qr<2485:2487>|qr code<2485:2492>|code<2488:2492>|code<2488:2493>|qr code<2485:2493>|box<2501:2504>|manual<2515:2521>|manual<2515:2522>|box<2552:2555>|manual<2564:2570>|all<2588:2591>|matter<2598:2604>|support<2605:2612>|matter support<2598:2612>|device<2636:2642>|support<2648:2655>|support<2648:2656>|matter<2657:2663>|listing<2673:2680>|case<2702:2706>|one<2735:2738>|one<2735:2739>|honestly<2734:2742>|rip<2784:2787>|all<2812:2815>|wall<2811:2815>|return<2820:2826>|give<2849:2853>|instead<2857:2864>|able<2901:2905>|connect<2916:2923>|connect<2916:2925>|google<2932:2938>|home<2939:2943>|google home<2932:2943>|link<2952:2956>|leviton<2963:2970>|able<2978:2982>|control<2986:2993>|all<3007:3010>|fall<3006:3012>|far<3013:3016>|short<3017:3022>|expectation<3029:3041>",

But this dimmer comes with the neutral and ground wires built in!This dimmer is a bit bulky though and I already had a lot of wires in the current box so it was a bit of a tight fit with everything but I got it in.It also has a dim on and dim off feature whenever you turn the light on and off.

      "Large size###large<0:5>|size<6:10>|large size<0:10>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★☆☆ [2022-02-03] <b>Works, but low power rating & burns out easy</b> So this device is pretty large.  Make sure you have a decent sized electrical switch box before ordering otherwise you won't be able to screw it down fully with the wires behind.  Or if you have a shallow wall I recommend getting a 2-gang box and just leave one side blank so you have room for the wires.I didn't realize till reading the documentation that this switch is only rated for 2.5 amps (300 watts), which is not a lot. Oddly (to me anyway) it says this limit is even less if using LED bulbs (150 watts).  I installed one to control a duplex electrical outlet that I plan to plug string lights into and I'm wondering now if I'm going to be able to find a light set that stays under that 150 watt LED threshold. This switch is really ideally used to control a handful of the older incandescent bulbs or a single digit number of LED bulbs rather than how I ended up using it.Last note is I installed a second one of these switches to control a single new exterior light.  On the install of the light the black wire was nicked going into the metal box (causing a fault/short to ground). When I first flipped the breaker on it immediately tripped and I smelt something burning. The switch was toast. I found the issue in the wire and repaired it, but ended up having to replace the switch entirely. Just something to keep in mind that if something happens to the circuit that trips the breaker your light switch will likely not survive and require replacement.###low<14:17>|power<18:23>|burn<33:38>|easy<43:47>|device<60:66>|pretty<70:76>|large<77:82>|decent<106:112>|electrical<119:129>|box<137:140>|otherwise<157:166>|able<180:184>|screw<188:193>|fully<202:207>|wire<217:221>|wire<217:222>|shallow<249:256>|low<253:256>|wall<257:261>|recommend<264:273>|2 gang<284:290>|gang<286:290>|gang box<286:294>|box<291:294>|leave<304:309>|side<314:318>|room<337:341>|wire<350:354>|wire<350:355>|realize<365:372>|read<378:385>|documentation<390:403>|rate<429:434>|amp<443:447>|watt<453:457>|watt<453:458>|300 watt<449:458>|anyway<494:500>|limit<515:520>|less<529:533>|led<543:546>|lead<543:546>|bulb<547:552>|watt<558:562>|150 watt<554:562>|150 watt<554:563>|watt<558:563>|install<569:576>|instal<569:578>|control<586:593>|electrical<603:613>|outlet<614:620>|plan<628:632>|plug<636:640>|string<641:647>|string light<641:654>|wonder<668:677>|now<678:681>|able<701:705>|find<709:713>|set<722:725>|stay<731:736>|watt<752:756>|150 watt<748:756>|led<757:760>|lead<757:760>|control<810:817>|old<835:840>|incandescent<841:853>|bulb<854:859>|incandescent bulb<841:859>|single<865:871>|number<878:884>|lead<888:891>|led<888:891>|bulb<892:897>|end<916:921>|last<934:938>|note<939:943>|install<949:956>|instal<949:958>|second<961:967>|control<993:1000>|single<1003:1009>|new<1010:1013>|exterior<1014:1022>|install<1038:1045>|black<1063:1068>|wire<1069:1073>|black wire<1063:1073>|metal<1100:1105>|metal box<1100:1109>|box<1106:1109>|cause<1111:1118>|fault<1121:1126>|short<1127:1132>|ground<1136:1142>|first<1152:1157>|flip<1158:1165>|breaker<1170:1177>|immediately<1184:1195>|trip<1196:1203>|burn<1226:1233>|find<1259:1264>|issue<1269:1274>|wire<1282:1286>|repair<1291:1299>|end<1308:1313>|replace<1327:1334>|entirely<1346:1354>|keep<1374:1378>|mind<1382:1386>|happen<1405:1412>|circuit<1420:1427>|trip<1433:1438>|breaker<1443:1450>|likely<1474:1480>|require<1497:1504>|replace<1505:1512>|replacement<1505:1516>",

I finally changed my switched to all Tp-link. But there are things that are not great and it’s too late you do. Let me explain a few things and if you have the same situation, don’t switch your old switches just because it’s cool.First, you have to have a neutral wire. If you live in an old building, this is not a product for you, period.Then your old box for the switches may not be big enough. This thing is much bigger than the old fashioned boxes. Measure before you start your project.Now, here is something more important: if you have WiFi extender, or Mesh WiFi system like Amazon’s Eero, and you want to use Alexa, it can be your nightmare:A switch may connect to a different unit/beacon time to time, for whatever reason. The Tp link switch may become “unresponsive” in Alexa. But it works perfectly in Kasa, the Tplink app. This is a deal breaker for me. I have been deleting, re-discovering the devices so often and it has lost of the purpose of having them.This is a known issue for a couple of years but it has not been resolved. The problem is you won’t know whom you should report your problem. Tplink? Amazon? The company makes the router?Other than that, when it’s working, it’s just so nice. It’s not about being lazy, it’s about not wasting time.###change<9:15>|old<21:24>|yet<39:42>|love<53:57>|new<62:65>|technology<66:78>|finally<82:89>|change<90:96>|change<90:97>|tp<117:119>|link<120:124>|tp link<117:124>|re<133:135>|re<137:139>|re<153:155>|re<161:163>|late<179:183>|let<192:195>|explain<199:206>|same<240:244>|situation<245:254>|old<274:277>|cool<305:309>|first<310:315>|neutral<336:343>|wire<344:348>|a neutral wire<334:348>|re<346:348>|neutral wire<336:348>|live<357:361>|old<368:371>|building<372:380>|period<413:419>|old<430:433>|box<434:437>|big<466:469>|big<497:500>|big<497:503>|old<513:516>|box<527:530>|box<527:532>|re<539:541>|re<546:548>|start<553:558>|project<564:571>|now<572:575>|re<579:581>|re<597:599>|important<600:609>|wifi<623:627>|extender<628:636>|wifi extender<623:636>|mesh<641:645>|wifi<646:650>|mesh wifi<641:650>|system<651:657>|eero<672:676>|alexa<698:703>|re<727:729>|nightmare<720:729>|connect<743:750>|re<761:763>|different<756:765>|unit<766:770>|re<805:807>|reason<805:811>|tp<817:819>|the tp link<813:824>|link<820:824>|tp link<817:824>|tp link switch<817:831>|become<836:842>|re<846:848>|unresponsive<844:856>|alexa<861:866>|perfectly<881:890>|kasa<894:898>|tp<904:906>|tplink<904:910>|link<906:910>|deal<926:930>|re<932:934>|a deal breaker<924:938>|deal breaker<926:938>|breaker<931:938>|delete<959:967>|re<969:971>|discover<972:983>|device<988:995>|often<999:1004>|lose<1016:1020>|purpose<1028:1035>|issue<1067:1072>|couple<1079:1085>|a couple<1077:1085>|year<1089:1094>|re<1115:1117>|resolve<1115:1123>|problem<1129:1136>|re<1171:1173>|report<1171:1177>|problem<1183:1190>|tp<1192:1194>|tplink<1192:1198>|link<1194:1198>|company<1212:1219>|lazy<1313:1317>|waste<1334:1341>",
      "Large electronics behind the plate###large<0:5>|electronic<6:17>|plate<29:34>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★☆☆ [2024-06-19] <b>Not for smart bulbs</b> This dimmer serves a very specific function: it lets you control hardwired, non-smart bulbs from your phone and other devices. If that's what you need, great.Unfortunately, that's not what I needed. I am converting from Phillips Hue bulbs to Kasa smart bulbs. I wanted something like the Hue wireless smart switches, where you can control all of a room's lights, no matter if they are hardwired to one switch or not. I have an overhead pendant light, a wall sconce, and two floor lamps that plug into outlets. Only the pendant is on the wall switch.The big drawback of the Hue dimmers is that they go through batteries like crazy. I thought this switch was primarily a hardwired version of a Hue dimmer, except that it worked with all Matter devices. I thought would let me dim and change scenes for ALL the bulbs from the switch. It does not. It works more like a conventional dimmer in that it reduces voltage to hardwired, dimmable bulbs and not smart bulbs on other circuits. And like conventional dimmers, the electronics behind the plate are huge. I couldn't even fit the switch into my outlet box.Next up, I tried to see if I could set up an Alexa routine to control all the bulbs from the Kasa smart dimmer. I was able to get it to power on and off all the lights from the switch, but there was no option to set a routine for the dimmer buttons. Nor could I program more than one color temperature / hue.  This was still better than what I could do from Google Home, which was nothing.I have a ceiling light in another room that doesn't use smart bulbs. I think I'll install this in that room. But if you're looking for a way to control a room full of smart bulbs on various circuits, this ain't it.###smart<11:16>|bulb<17:22>|dim<32:35>|dimmer<32:38>|specific<53:61>|function<62:70>|let<75:78>|let<75:79>|control<84:91>|hardwired<92:101>|non<103:106>|smart<107:112>|bulb<113:118>|phone<129:134>|device<145:152>|unfortunately<185:198>|convert<231:241>|phillips<247:255>|hue<256:259>|bulb<260:265>|kasa<269:273>|smart<274:279>|bulb<280:285>|hue<315:318>|wireless<319:327>|smart<328:333>|control<358:365>|room<375:379>|matter<393:399>|hardwired<412:421>|overhead<454:462>|pendant<463:470>|pendant light<463:476>|wall<480:484>|floor<501:506>|lamp<507:512>|plug<518:522>|let<531:534>|outlet<528:534>|outlet<528:535>|let<531:535>|pendant<546:553>|wall<564:568>|big<580:583>|hue<600:603>|dim<604:607>|dimmer<604:610>|dimmer<604:611>|battery<636:645>|crazy<651:656>|hardwired<696:705>|version<706:713>|hue<719:722>|dim<723:726>|dimmer<723:729>|matter<762:768>|device<769:776>|let<794:797>|dim<801:804>|change<809:815>|scene<816:822>|bulb<835:840>|conventional<892:904>|dim<905:908>|dimmer<905:911>|reduce<923:930>|voltage<931:938>|hardwired<942:951>|dim<953:956>|dimmable<953:961>|able<957:961>|dimmable bulb<953:967>|bulb<962:967>|smart<976:981>|bulb<982:987>|circuit<997:1005>|conventional<1016:1028>|dim<1029:1032>|dimmer<1029:1035>|dimmer<1029:1036>|electronic<1042:1053>|plate<1065:1070>|huge<1075:1079>|fit<1097:1100>|outlet<1120:1126>|let<1123:1126>|outlet box<1120:1130>|box<1127:1130>|next<1131:1135>|set<1166:1169>|alexa<1176:1181>|routine<1182:1189>|control<1193:1200>|bulb<1209:1214>|kasa<1224:1228>|smart<1229:1234>|dim<1235:1238>|smart dimmer<1229:1241>|dimmer<1235:1241>|kasa smart dimmer<1224:1241>|able<1249:1253>|power<1267:1272>|option<1333:1339>|set<1343:1346>|routine<1349:1356>|dim<1365:1368>|dimmer<1365:1371>|button<1372:1379>|program<1393:1400>|color<1415:1420>|hue<1435:1438>|still<1450:1455>|google<1489:1495>|google home<1489:1500>|home<1496:1500>|ceiling<1529:1536>|ceiling light<1529:1542>|another room<1546:1558>|room<1554:1558>|smart<1576:1581>|bulb<1582:1587>|install<1602:1609>|room<1623:1627>|control<1664:1671>|room<1674:1678>|full<1679:1683>|smart<1687:1692>|bulb<1693:1698>|various<1702:1709>|circuit<1710:1718>",
      "Oversized design###oversized<0:9>|design<10:16>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★☆☆ [2024-01-13] <b>Excellent product; horrible size</b> As some others have commented: these switches integrate seamlessly with Alexa; I can't speak to their Google compatibility. I had some trouble with these initially and flickering, and yes, I ran through all troubleshooting steps, not to mention I am pretty familiar with both the installation of electrical devices being in the trade, and having professional IT experience, including with devices such as these (I've installed just about every type of smart switch on the market) none-the-less, I find that these will somehow become more compatible with the fixture they are installed to over time and usually stop flickering.I also think of all the smart dimmers on the market, these have the nicest transitioning while going from one level of brightness to another. The dimming is almost as seamless as classic Lutron and Leviton dimmers were with incandescent bulbs. Most Smart Dimmers bring brightness down/up vice versa in harsh \"steps\" - these have a really smooth transition from one level to the next.Two things I dislike as opposed to others on the market: I wish they had some more design options- or that they went with a white that was a bit more compatible with the white found in most switch plates and outlet receptacle plates. A matte white would be preferable.My biggest issue? These are by far the LARGEST dimmers - even in comparison to dimmers I was installing for LED lights when the technology first came out pre-smart-home devices. I've even had to tell some clients that I've done construction/electrical work for that they simply would have to go with a different dimmer (I have several recommendations that while not as seamless in their mechanics, are almost HALF the size of these). The technology exists for these to be MUCH slimmer and smaller in profile and design. Even for my own home, if I did not have the training and technical expertise to physically rip out electrical boxes that were native to my home and replace them with newer boxes that have more Cu In. available, I would have had to go with a different product. Very disappointing for such a well designed product as far as technology goes. I hope TP-Link Kasa seriously reconsiders the physical design of these. Would definitely be a 5-star product, but had to knock off two stars because of their extraordinarily obtuse and oversized design.###size<31:35>|comment<60:69>|integrate<86:95>|less<100:104>|seamless<96:104>|seamlessly<96:106>|alexa<112:117>|speak<127:132>|google<142:148>|compatibility<149:162>|trouble<175:182>|initially<194:203>|flicker<208:218>|flickering<208:218>|run<231:234>|trouble<247:254>|troubleshooting<247:262>|step<263:268>|mention<277:284>|pre<290:293>|pretty<290:296>|familiar<297:305>|installation<320:332>|electrical<336:346>|device<347:354>|professional<386:398>|experience<402:412>|include<414:423>|device<429:436>|instal<457:466>|type<484:488>|smart<492:497>|market<512:518>|the market<508:518>|none<520:524>|less<529:533>|find<537:541>|somehow<558:565>|become<566:572>|compatible<578:588>|fixture<598:605>|instal<615:624>|usually<642:649>|stop<650:654>|flickering<655:665>|flicker<655:665>|smart<690:695>|dimmer<696:702>|smart dimmer<690:703>|dimmer<696:703>|market<711:717>|the market<707:717>|run<742:745>|level<776:781>|brightness<785:795>|dimming<812:819>|most<825:829>|almost<823:829>|less<837:841>|seamless<833:841>|lutron<853:859>|leviton<864:871>|dimmer<872:878>|dimmer<872:879>|incandescent<890:902>|incandescent bulb<890:908>|bulb<903:908>|most<910:914>|smart<915:920>|dimmer<921:928>|smart dimmer<915:928>|bring<929:934>|brightness<935:945>|own<947:950>|step<975:980>|smooth<1004:1010>|run<1012:1015>|level<1031:1036>|next<1044:1048>|market<1098:1104>|the market<1094:1104>|wish<1108:1112>|design<1132:1138>|white<1173:1178>|compatible<1199:1209>|white<1219:1224>|find<1225:1230>|most<1234:1238>|plate<1246:1252>|outlet<1257:1263>|receptacle<1264:1274>|plate<1275:1281>|white<1291:1296>|pre<1306:1309>|big<1320:1327>|issue<1328:1333>|big issue<1320:1333>|far<1348:1351>|dimmer<1364:1370>|dimmer<1364:1371>|comparison<1382:1392>|dimmer<1396:1402>|dimmer<1396:1403>|instal<1410:1420>|led<1425:1428>|led light<1425:1435>|technology<1445:1455>|first<1456:1461>|pre<1471:1474>|smart<1475:1480>|smart home<1475:1485>|home<1481:1485>|device<1486:1493>|smart home device<1475:1493>|construction<1545:1557>|electrical<1558:1568>|simply<1588:1594>|different<1619:1628>|dimmer<1629:1635>|recommendation<1652:1667>|seamless<1686:1694>|less<1690:1694>|most<1721:1725>|almost<1719:1725>|size<1735:1739>|technology<1755:1765>|exist<1766:1772>|slim<1794:1801>|small<1806:1813>|profile<1817:1824>|design<1829:1835>|own<1849:1852>|home<1853:1857>|technical<1894:1903>|physical<1917:1925>|physically<1917:1927>|rip<1928:1931>|electrical<1936:1946>|box<1947:1952>|electrical box<1936:1952>|native<1963:1969>|home<1976:1980>|replace<1985:1992>|new<2003:2008>|box<2009:2014>|available<2037:2046>|different<2078:2087>|disappointing<2102:2115>|design<2132:2138>|design<2132:2140>|far<2152:2155>|technology<2159:2169>|hope<2178:2182>|tp<2183:2185>|link<2186:2190>|tp link<2183:2190>|link kasa<2186:2195>|tp link kasa<2183:2195>|kasa<2191:2195>|physical<2222:2230>|design<2231:2237>|definitely<2254:2264>|5 star<2270:2276>|knock<2297:2302>|size<2365:2369>|oversized<2361:2370>|design<2371:2377>",

It works great with the Kasa App and plays nice with Google Home, IFTTT and Home Assistant.  I've worked it into a couple of automations and it's been responsive and worked as expected every step of the way.  It also has a good looking, minimal design.There are just 2 things keeping me from giving it a full 5 stars:  1. As others have said, it's quite large.  It took some doing to get it to fit into my switch box with all the wires that were already in there.  Doable, but it did try my patience a little bit.  2.  When the lights are off or dimmed, there's a VERY faint high pitch whine that comes from the switch.  I can't hear it unless I'm right up on the switch, but now that I've noticed it, I can't pretend it's not there.  It's super quiet, but definitely not silent.All said, it's a great bang for the buck and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.  I do wish TP-Link would release a 3-way version of this dimmer.  I'd rather keep the look consistent than buy another brand.###great value<3:14>|value<9:14>|a couple<42:50>|couple<44:50>|consider<64:72>|first<96:101>|step<102:106>|build<114:122>|smart<125:130>|smart home<125:135>|home<131:135>|a smart home<123:135>|installation<145:157>|straightforward<162:177>|kasa<269:273>|the kasa app<265:277>|kasa app<269:277>|play<282:287>|google<298:304>|google home<298:309>|home<305:309>|ifttt<311:316>|home<321:325>|assistant<326:335>|home assistant<321:335>|a couple<358:366>|couple<360:366>|automation<370:381>|responsive<396:406>|step<436:440>|looking<473:480>|minimal<482:489>|design<490:496>|keep<521:525>|keep<521:528>|give<537:543>|full<549:553>|5 star<554:561>|large<599:604>|fit<639:642>|box<658:661>|wire<675:680>|already<691:698>|dim<791:797>|faint<814:819>|high<820:824>|hear<874:878>|now<921:924>|notice<935:942>|super<985:990>|definitely<1002:1012>|buck<1060:1064>|again<1099:1104>|wish<1112:1116>|tp<1117:1119>|link<1120:1124>|tp link<1117:1124>|release<1131:1138>|3 way<1141:1146>|version<1147:1154>|dimmer<1163:1169>|keep<1183:1187>|consistent<1197:1207>|brand<1225:1230>|another brand<1217:1230>",

So an already bulky switch that at least had side mounted wiring connections, now takes up even more space. Try fitting five wire nuts behind this switch in a standard single gang electrical box. Good luck. It feels like this was either reimagined by an engineer who has never taken a switch plate off or someone in cost controls trying to limit the price of making this switch.It’s a bummer because functionality they are great. The app is simple and just frankly works. These things lose their glory at the form factor and sheer size. Now with Gen 2, they are even harder to actually get in a wall.###design<19:25>|design<19:27>|bulky<37:42>|ever<82:86>|gen<96:99>|version<102:109>|version<102:110>|fail<150:154>|3 year<167:174>|year<169:174>|year of use<169:181>|gen<188:191>|version<194:201>|clearly<205:212>|engineer<216:224>|design<227:233>|one<235:238>|office<257:263>|one<272:275>|ever<287:291>|touch<292:299>|screwdriver<302:313>|gen<320:323>|repeatedly<328:338>|fail<339:343>|fail<339:345>|short<356:361>|period<367:373>|gen<379:382>|now<396:399>|pigtail<410:417>|wiring<418:424>|require<430:437>|wire<438:442>|wire nut<438:447>|nut<443:447>|already<455:462>|bulky<463:468>|least<484:489>|side<494:498>|mount<499:506>|wiring<507:513>|connection<514:525>|now<527:530>|space<550:555>|more space<545:555>|fit<561:568>|wire<574:578>|wire nut<574:583>|nut<579:583>|standard<608:616>|single<617:623>|single gang<617:628>|gang<624:628>|electrical<629:639>|box<640:643>|electrical box<629:643>|good luck<645:654>|luck<650:654>|feel<659:664>|either<679:685>|engineer<703:711>|ever<721:725>|never<720:725>|plate<741:746>|one<758:761>|cost<765:769>|control<770:778>|limit<789:794>|price<799:804>|functionality<849:862>|simple<890:896>|lose<934:938>|form<958:962>|factor<963:969>|size<980:984>|now<986:989>|gen<995:998>|hard<1016:1022>|actually<1026:1034>|wall<1044:1048>",

This overall was pretty good but it wasnt good enough that I wanted to do the whole new house in them so I went looking for another solution/path.I ordered a few different switches. paired them up with our google home and ultimately ended up with Kasa as our choice and ordered 70+ switches (this included some dimmers, some not, as well as their 3 way kits).We got them all installed, paired up and just like in my previous test, every last one of them worked flawless.Below are a list of positives:  -- DIMMER SETTING - The dimmers have a awesome feature where you can set the lowest level of dimming so that if your bulbs pulsate or anything you can get rid of that.  -- Operation speed - no matter if controlling via the actuall switch or throug google home the speed is instantaneous.  This is one things that blew my mind as our previous z-wave/wink hub combo would often take a few trys and/or take a second to actually turn on.  -- The Kasa App - There are a few other products in our home that are not TP-Link brand and while they work fine, the applications that you have to configure the device in and/or the application that you pair up with Google Home seem like an afterthought.  The Kasa app is a solid piece of software that literally has worked flawlessly as we paired all of our switches.The Negatives (dont let these sway you to not buy but...)  -- the size of the switch.  If you have a ton of wires and or a super shallow box in the wall it may not work or you may have problems pushing it in.  I noted the size of the switches to the builder but it unfortunately didnt make it to our electrician and they used standard sized boxes.  The switches all ultimately fit but some of them took some work.  (BTW.. this is a universal \"problem\" amongst all smart switches.  -- REALLY NIT PICKY --the switches come with a beautiful \"screwless\" plate however if you have a multi gang box (multiple switches in the same box) then you will need to find another plate.  We tried a few screwless designs and ultimately stuck with these plates but the switches dont fit perfectly flush with these plates.  This is especially true if you have dimmer/non dimmer/3 way switches in the same box as all of those switches seem to have different thickness backing plates on the switch.Overall, these are awesome, work great and I would do it again in a heartbeat!!!###house<23:28>|kasa<32:36>|build<63:68>|new<71:74>|home<75:79>|ft<89:91>|house<117:122>|kasa<126:130>|absolutely<143:153>|regret<157:164>|previous<172:180>|home<181:185>|wave<202:206>|z wave<200:206>|pair<220:224>|pair<220:226>|hub<242:245>|all<257:260>|overall<253:260>|pretty<265:271>|whole<326:331>|new<332:335>|house<336:341>|solution<380:388>|different<410:419>|pair<430:434>|pair<430:436>|google<454:460>|home<461:465>|google home<454:465>|ultimately<470:480>|end<481:486>|kasa<495:499>|choice<507:513>|include<545:553>|dimmer<559:565>|dimmer<559:566>|3 way<595:600>|all<619:622>|all<627:630>|instal<623:632>|pair<634:638>|pair<634:640>|previous<664:672>|test<673:677>|last<685:689>|flawless<709:717>|list<730:734>|dimmer<753:759>|setting<760:767>|dimmer<774:780>|dimmer<774:781>|feature<797:804>|set<819:822>|low<827:833>|low level<827:839>|level<834:839>|dim<843:850>|bulb<867:872>|rid<905:908>|operation<922:931>|speed<932:937>|matter<943:949>|control<953:964>|all<977:980>|google<998:1004>|google home<998:1009>|home<1005:1009>|speed<1014:1019>|mind<1071:1075>|previous<1083:1091>|z wave<1092:1098>|wave<1094:1098>|hub<1104:1107>|combo<1108:1113>|ft<1121:1123>|often<1120:1125>|second<1156:1162>|all<1170:1173>|actually<1166:1174>|turn<1175:1179>|kasa<1192:1196>|kasa app<1192:1200>|the kasa app<1188:1200>|home<1241:1245>|tp<1259:1261>|link<1262:1266>|brand<1267:1272>|application<1303:1314>|application<1303:1315>|configure<1333:1342>|device<1347:1353>|application<1368:1379>|pair<1389:1393>|google<1402:1408>|home<1409:1413>|google home<1402:1413>|ft<1428:1430>|kasa<1446:1450>|the kasa app<1442:1454>|kasa app<1446:1454>|solid<1460:1465>|piece<1466:1471>|ft<1477:1479>|software<1475:1483>|all<1494:1497>|literally<1489:1498>|flawless<1510:1518>|flawlessly<1510:1520>|pair<1527:1531>|pair<1527:1533>|all<1534:1537>|negative<1558:1567>|let<1574:1577>|size<1620:1624>|ton<1655:1658>|a ton<1653:1658>|wire<1662:1667>|super<1677:1682>|all<1685:1688>|shallow<1683:1690>|box<1691:1694>|wall<1702:1706>|all<1703:1706>|problem<1739:1746>|problem<1739:1747>|push<1748:1755>|note<1766:1771>|size<1776:1780>|unfortunately<1819:1832>|electrician<1854:1865>|standard<1880:1888>|size<1889:1893>|box<1895:1898>|box<1895:1900>|all<1916:1919>|ultimately<1920:1930>|fit<1931:1934>|btw<1970:1973>|problem<1997:2004>|all<2014:2017>|smart<2018:2023>|screwless<2093:2102>|plate<2104:2109>|however<2110:2117>|multi<2132:2137>|multi gang<2132:2142>|gang<2138:2142>|a multi gang<2130:2142>|box<2143:2146>|gang box<2138:2146>|multi gang box<2132:2146>|multi<2148:2153>|multiple<2148:2156>|same<2173:2177>|box<2178:2181>|the same box<2169:2181>|find<2205:2209>|plate<2218:2223>|screwless<2241:2250>|design<2251:2258>|ultimately<2263:2273>|stick<2274:2279>|plate<2291:2296>|plate<2291:2297>|fit<2320:2323>|perfectly<2324:2333>|flush<2334:2339>|plate<2351:2356>|plate<2351:2357>|all<2374:2377>|especially<2368:2378>|dimmer<2396:2402>|non<2403:2406>|dimmer<2407:2413>|3 way<2414:2419>|same<2436:2440>|box<2441:2444>|the same box<2432:2444>|all<2448:2451>|different<2483:2492>|thickness<2493:2502>|back<2503:2510>|plate<2511:2516>|plate<2511:2517>|overall<2532:2539>|all<2536:2539>|again<2589:2594>",
      "Large back cover###large<0:5>|large back<0:10>|back<6:10>|cover<11:16>|||B079775ZZQ ★★☆☆☆ [2023-01-14] <b>Not the best design and no web interface. Requires app for install and updates.</b> These are smart / WiFi dimmers that are hard-wired into a junction box for switched lights.Only supports 2.4 Ghz WifI band -- some of the hardware variants used in individual dimmers will stay connected indefinitely and some will disconnect and reconnect randomly and as frequently every few minutes.  It apparently has to do with the WiFi chips, firmware, or both.Sometimes the brightness level LEDs on the top if the dimmer will get stuck and stay on and at other times, they turn off after a few seconds.Alexa integration is OK for basic functions, but gets complicated rapidly as the number of named devices increases. You will need to come up with creative names if, for example, you have more than one dimmer per named room and then you will have to remember which are which. There is no alexa integration for calibration. firmware updates, or time or time zone adjustments.These dimmers work for most light sources:  incandescent (but wattage is limited to 200) and some dimmable fluorescent and some LED bulbs.Requires an app for initial installation, dimmer calibration, and for firmware or time updates.There is no easy reference source on the product page for bulb compatibility, so be sure you test your bulbs before going to the trouble to install these dimmers.Worked poorly on Feit LED candelabra bulbs: there was noticeable bulb flickering at dimming levels below 60 percent.Single pole (one switch) only.  Requires a neutral and ground connection, so there will be four wire connections per dimmer (green, white, and two for the controlled device).  Oddly, the green and white connections require wire nuts but the line and load are screwed into the side of the dimmer.Large back cover uses a lot of space in the junction box, so not the best choice for small or crowded junction boxes.The front up and down controls are too small and should be bigger.The indicator LED bulb is very dim and cannot be seen in a bright room.  A dimmable indicator on a dimmer would have been be a logical design choice, but it's not available on this model.There still is no web interface for these smart dimmers -- only app controls.  The Apple app does not support accessibility options and is not suitable for those with vision issues -- moreover, the contrast and size on the app screens is very poor even for those with good vision -- especially if your Apple device uses adaptive backlighting.There is a removable, screwless faceplate which is a nice feature. The face plate and switch front are a high gloss finish that shows fingerprints and scratches; a matte finish would be much better.There are two very small, unmarked and hard-to-access switches built into the dimmer bottom.  One reboots the dimmer without removing the programming and account information. The other wipes the device and removes it from an account.For those who prefer a flawless installation, be sure that the dimmer is not angled when you screw it into the junction box.  If there is any angle, the face plate will not fit flush with the dimmer. This is especially important if there are more than one switch or dimmer in a junction box.###design<16:22>|web<30:33>|interface<34:43>|face<39:43>|require<45:53>|install<62:69>|update<74:81>|smart<97:102>|wifi<105:109>|dim<110:113>|dimmer<110:116>|dimmer<110:117>|hard<127:131>|wire<132:136>|wire<132:137>|junction<145:153>|box<154:157>|junction

      "Larger than normal switches###large<0:6>|normal<12:18>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2019-10-02] <b>Works great</b> I have installed 4 of the HS220 and 6 of the HS200. These work great. Installation on the first one was a little complicated but after that it became easy. The only trouble is trying to fit 3 in a box with all the wires and wires. It takes time a finesse as well as some trial and error with putting wall plate on to make sure they are all straight. But that's to be expected. The control area is larger than a normal switch so the space becomes limited. The HS220 are nice because the house wires screw into the side of the switch but the HS200 have all the wires come out of the switch and have to be installed with wire nuts. I did have problems with the switches disconnecting from my router on several occasions but after doing some research I Purchased a placed all of my smart home products on a AC1900Nighthawk WiFi Mesh Extender that is wired so im not using the mesh feature. I have not had a problem. I have 22 wifi wall switches, 3 ceiling fan switches and multiple wall plugs all on the same router and it has not had any problems since I put everything on its own router. The install is easy with a house that's only 14 years old and has common wire-White wire-. Once your have set up the Kasa app and linked a switch its really easy to link any new switches you install. I also have WEMO switches and a few other brands on the same network and have had no problems with any of them interfering with each other. Everything is connected with Alexa and works great. I have different routines set up for different lights and wall plugs which makes it so nice. Some lights turn on at dusk and turn off at dawn and others turn on and off at random times. Notifications of what is doing what when I'm not home is nice because I then know who is home. The dimmers are nice because once installed you can test the dimmer function with the specific lights. All lights are different. LED use less power and are brighter than incandescent bulbs so during the setup it will let you adjust the minimum dimness you want and after that it remembers how low is the lowest setting.###all<30:33>|install<26:33>|instal<26:35>|all<93:96>|installation<89:101>|first<109:114>|one<115:118>|the first one<105:118>|complicated<132:143>|become<162:168>|easy<169:173>|trouble<184:191>|fit<205:208>|box<216:219>|all<225:228>|wire<233:237>|wire<233:238>|wire<243:247>|wire<243:248>|trial<290:295>|error<300:305>|put<311:314>|put<311:318>|wall<319:323>|all<320:323>|wall plate<319:329>|plate<324:329>|all<355:358>|straight<359:367>|control<400:407>|area<408:412>|large<416:422>|normal<430:436>|a normal switch<428:443>|space<451:456>|become<457:464>|limited<465:472>|house<505:510>|wire<511:515>|wire<511:516>|screw<517:522>|side<532:536>|all<570:573>|wire<578:582>|wire<578:583>|all<626:629>|install<622:629>|instal<622:631>|wire<637:641>|nut<642:646>|wire nut<637:646>|problem<659:666>|problem<659:667>|disconnect<686:699>|router<708:714>|occasion<726:735>|research<757:765>|place<780:786>|all<787:790>|smart<797:802>|home<803:807>|smart home<797:807>|wifi<838:842>|mesh<843:847>|extender<848:856>|wire<865:869>|wire<865:870>|mesh<891:895>|feature<896:903>|problem<922:929>|wifi<941:945>|wall<946:950>|all<947:950>|ceiling<963:970>|fan<971:974>|ceiling fan<963:974>|multiple<988:996>|all<998:1001>|wall<997:1001>|plug<1002:1007>|all<1008:1011>|same<1019:1023>|router<1024:1030>|problem<1054:1061>|any problem<1050:1062>|problem<1054:1062>|put<1071:1074>|own<1093:1096>|router<1097:1103>|install<1109:1116>|all<1113:1116>|easy<1120:1124>|house<1132:1137>|year<1153:1158>|old<1159:1162>|common<1171:1177>|wire<1178:1182>|white<1183:1188>|wire<1189:1193>|once<1196:1200>|set<1211:1214>|kasa<1222:1226>|kasa app<1222:1230>|the kasa app<1218:1230>|link<1235:1239>|link<1235:1241>|all<1257:1260>|easy<1262:1266>|link<1270:1274>|new<1279:1282>|install<1296:1303>|all<1300:1303>|wemo<1317:1321>|other brand<1341:1353>|brand<1347:1353>|same<1361:1365>|network<1366:1373>|problem<1390:1397>|problem<1390:1398>|no problem<1387:1398>|interfere<1416:1427>|connect<1459:1468>|alexa<1474:1479>|different<1504:1513>|routine<1514:1522>|set<1523:1526>|different<1534:1543>|wall<1555:1559>|all<1556:1559>|plug<1560:1565>|turn<1602:1606>|dusk<1613:1617>|turn<1622:1626>|dawn<1634:1638>|turn<1650:1654>|random<1669:1675>|notification<1683:1696>|home<1732:1736>|home<1772:1776>|dimmer<1782:1788>|dimmer<1782:1789>|once<1807:1811>|install<1812:1819>|all<1816:1819>|instal<1812:1821>|test<1830:1834>|dimmer<1839:1845>|function<1846:1854>|the dimmer function<1835:1854>|specific<1864:1872>|all<1881:1884>|different<1896:1905>|lead<1907:1910>|less<1915:1919>|power<1920:1925>|bright<1934:1942>|incandescent<1948:1960>|bulb<1961:1966>|set<1981:1984>|setup<1981:1986>|let<1995:1998>|adjust<2003:2009>|minimum<2014:2021>|dimness<2022:2029>|remember<2057:2066>|low<2071:2074>|low<2082:2085>|low<2082:2088>|set<2089:2092>|the low setting<2078:2096>|setting<2089:2096>|low setting<2082:2096>",

      "Large size of switches###large<0:5>|size<6:10>|large size<0:10>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2023-12-29] <b>Wow! Electronics that work great!!</b> I am recently new to kasa wifi products and am loving it! it all started because I installed white lights and colored lights on my Christmas tree and wanted to control them individually, sometimes just the white, sometimes just the colors, sometimes both so I started looking for a power strip that could do it. i found a 6 way power strip that had a separate push button switch for each of the 6 outlets and as a bonus, with the downloaded software I could control it from anywhere! And I mean anywhere!! Not just within my wifi network!!  I wasn't sure what I was getting into but I bought it. It works great. I love that I can set a timer to turn them on and off. ( No \"HEY GOOGLE\" or ALEXA\" for this kid) the app works great! I have since found uses for all of the spaces on the strip for other lights and and even to turn off the aquarium water filter while I feed so it doesn't suck in the food. Then I found I could get individual light bulbs that you can adjust colors and dim! I can schedule the lights to turn on or off at a certain time, even sunrise and sunset, or up to an hour before or after any of those. So now my living room lights come on by them selves 20 minutes before sunset and I turn them off my self when after I go to bed so I can see well down the stairs before turning them off. And when I go to bed, my headboard light is on and waiting for me, which when I'm ready to go to sleep, I don't have to reach up and turn the switch, I just pull up the app and turn it off. Oh! Also, the power strip also tells you power usage from each outlet!!! I installed a switch to control my front outside house lights so now they turn on automagically 30 minutes after sunset and turn off 20 minutes before sunrise and they can still be turned on or off manually. Then plug in outlets, I have two of them now and they do great!! Now just waiting for the ceiling fan and dimmer switches which are now supposed to come out after January!! When those finally become available, I'll be able to control the lights and my ceiling fans from my phone while I watch a movie or whatever!!Sorry this is so long, I'm so excited about these things. Now I have installed these three dimmable switches in my great room to control 3 groups of lights. Now when we want to watch a movie, we don't have to turn off the lights and maybe stumble over things to get to the seats, or live with the lights being on. Now I can get to my seat, snacks in hand, then sit down and turn the lights on or off or dim any of the three groups from the app (though you can still turn them off and on from the switch if you were to insist on being a knuckle dragging neanderthal).Now a few tips, these things seem pretty large but if you compare, the depth is really about the same.Now when you set them up, power up one item at a time, set it up, then do the next as each one has its own id number. as others have said, if you were to install all 3 switches and they were all powered at the same time, you'd likely have issues. For the switches, make sure you have a neutral (usually white) wire available.###electronic<8:19>|recently<47:55>|new<56:59>|kasa<63:67>|wifi<68:72>|love<89:95>|all<103:106>|start<107:114>|install<125:132>|all<129:132>|instal<125:134>|white<135:140>|color<152:159>|christmas<173:182>|tree<183:187>|christmas tree<173:187>|control<202:209>|i d<220:222>|individual<215:225>|all<223:226>|individually<215:227>|sometimes<229:238>|white<248:253>|sometimes<255:264>|color<274:280>|sometimes<282:291>|start<302:309>|power<324:329>|power strip<324:335>|strip<330:335>|find<356:361>|power<370:375>|strip<376:381>|power strip<370:381>|separate<393:401>|push<402:406>|button<407:413>|outlet<439:445>|outlet<439:446>|bonus<456:461>|own<473:476>|download<472:482>|software<483:491>|control<500:507>|anywhere<516:524>|mean<532:536>|anywhere<537:545>|wifi<567:571>|wifi network<567:579>|network<572:579>|love<656:660>|set<672:675>|timer<678:683>|turn<687:691>|hey<715:718>|hey google<715:725>|google<719:725>|alexa<730:735>|kid<746:749>|i d<747:749>|find<785:790>|all<800:803>|space<811:817>|strip<825:830>|turn<864:868>|water<886:891>|suck<926:930>|find<951:956>|i d<974:976>|individual<969:979>|bulb<986:991>|adjust<1005:1011>|color<1012:1018>|dim<1023:1026>|schedule<1034:1042>|turn<1057:1061>|certain<1077:1084>|certain time<1077:1089>|sunrise<1096:1103>|sunset<1108:1114>|set<1111:1114>|an hour<1125:1132>|hour<1128:1132>|now<1166:1169>|living<1173:1179>|room<1180:1184>|living room<1173:1184>|living room light<1173:1191>|self<1208:1214>|20 minute<1215:1225>|minute<1218:1225>|set<1236:1239>|sunset<1233:1239>|turn<1246:1250>|self<1263:1267>|bed<1287:1290>|own<1310:1313>|stair<1318:1324>|turn<1332:1336>|turn<1332:1339>|bed<1367:1370>|wait<1401:1408>|ready<1432:1437>|sleep<1447:1452>|reach<1470:1475>|turn<1483:1487>|pull<1507:1511>|turn<1527:1531>|power<1554:1559>|power strip<1554:1565>|strip<1560:1565>|power<1581:1586>|usage<1587:1592>|outlet<1603:1609>|install<1615:1622>|all<1619:1622>|instal<1615:1624>|control<1637:1644>|front<1648:1653>|i d<1658:1660>|house<1662:1667>|now<1678:1681>|turn<1687:1691>|all<1704:1707>|minute<1712:1719>|30 minute<1709:1719>|sunset<1726:1732>|set<1729:1732>|turn<1737:1741>|minute<1749:1756>|20 minute<1746:1756>|sunrise<1764:1771>|still<1785:1790>|turn<1794:1798>|turn<1794:1800>|all<1815:1818>|manually<1811:1819>|plug<1826:1830>|outlet<1834:1840>|outlet<1834:1841>|now<1862:1865>|now<1886:1889>|wait<1895:1902>|ceiling<1911:1918>|fan<1919:1922>|ceiling fan<1911:1922>|dim<1927:1930>|dimmer<1927:1933>|now<1953:1956>|suppose<1957:1965>|all<2008:2011>|finally<2005:2012>|become<2013:2019>|able<2025:2029>|available<2020:2029>|able<2039:2043>|control<2047:2054>|ceiling<2073:2080>|ceiling fan<2073:2084>|fan<2081:2084>|ceiling fan<2073:2085>|fan<2081:2085>|phone<2094:2099>|one<2096:2099>|watch<2108:2113>|movie<2116:2121>|long<2152:2156>|excited<2165:2172>|now<2193:2196>|install<2204:2211>|all<2208:2211>|instal<2204:2213>|dim<2226:2229>|dimmable<2226:2234>|able<2230:2234>|room<2256:2260>|control<2264:2271>|group<2274:2280>|now<2292:2295>|watch<2312:2317>|movie<2320:2325>|turn<2344:2348>|live<2418:2422>|now<2449:2452>|hand<2485:2489>|sit<2496:2499>|own<2501:2504>|turn<2509:2513>|dim<2538:2541>|group<2559:2565>|still<2595:2600>|turn<2601:2605>|now<2701:2704>|tip<2711:2715>|pretty<2735:2741>|large<2742:2747>|compare<2759:2766>|depth<2772:2777>|all<2783:2786>|same<2798:2802>|now<2803:2806>|set<2816:2819>|power<2829:2834>|one<2838:2841>|set<2858:2861>|next<2881:2885>|each one<2889:2897>|one<2894:2897>|own<2906:2909>|i d<2910:2912>|number<2913:2919>|i d<2938:2940>|all<2961:2964>|install<2957:2964>|all<2965:2968>|all<2994:2997>|power<2998:3003>|power<2998:3005>|same<3013:3017>|the same time<3009:3022>|likely<3030:3036>|issue<3042:3048>|neutral<3089:3096>|all<3101:3104>|usually<3098:3105>|white<3106:3111>|wire<3113:3117>|white wire<3106:3117>|available<3118:3127>|able<3123:3127>",
      "Bulky and thick device###bulky<0:5>|thick<10:15>|device<16:22>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★☆☆ [2024-11-20] <b>It works great BUT... yes BUT</b> The product itself is very good. It works perfectly fine and it dims the lights on command with the help of its native app or Google or Alexa, so.. 5 stars there, oh and also the price point is very good too.Now, why 3 stars? Well, two main reasons:1) The device itself is very bulky and you have to have plenty of room inside the wall/box in order to insert this thing. It took me a good 30min to make it work.2) When I was about to put the faceplate (I didn't use the provided single plate that came with the switch because I am using it on a dual switch plate), anyway... the thing is too thick and the face plate wouldn't lay flush on the wall, no matter how much I screwed this thing in, so I had to grab the dremmel and file down a bunch of material around the dimmer switch in order for the faceplate to lay flush. I had to be very careful in order to avoid damaging the areas that were going to be visible after installing the faceplate, but lucky for me, I was able to make it work it and it looks great!With that being said, If I needed to buy another one I probably would buy a different brand that has a more slim/thin device or maybe since I already know how to make it work with the dremmel, I would perhaps buy this one again since the price is very good and I would like everything else to match!With all that being said, this was my particular case.. maybe your faceplate is deeper/thicker than mine and this switch would work without having to modify it. But, just keep this in mind in case you do actually have to make it work if you want a clean install.###perfectly<79:88>|dim<101:105>|command<120:127>|help<137:141>|native<149:155>|native app<149:159>|google<163:169>|alexa<173:178>|5 star<185:192>|price<216:221>|price point<216:227>|point<222:227>|now<245:248>|3 star<254:261>|main<273:277>|device<293:299>|bulky<315:320>|plenty<342:348>|room<352:356>|wall<368:372>|box<373:376>|thin<401:405>|put<471:474>|face<479:483>|faceplate<479:488>|plate<483:488>|provide<507:515>|single<516:522>|plate<523:528>|dual<582:586>|plate<594:599>|anyway<602:608>|thin<616:620>|thick<629:634>|face<643:647>|plate<648:653>|face plate<643:653>|the face plate<639:653>|lay<663:666>|flush<667:672>|wall<680:684>|matter<689:695>|screw<707:714>|thin<720:724>|grab<742:746>|file<763:767>|bunch<775:780>|a bunch<773:780>|material<784:792>|dimmer<804:810>|face<835:839>|plate<839:844>|faceplate<835:844>|lay<848:851>|flush<852:857>|careful<876:883>|avoid<896:901>|damage<902:910>|area<915:920>|visible<943:950>|install<957:964>|instal<957:967>|face<972:976>|faceplate<972:981>|plate<976:981>|lucky<987:992>|able<1007:1011>|one<1099:1102>|probably<1105:1113>|different<1126:1135>|different brand<1126:1141>|brand<1136:1141>|a different brand<1124:1141>|slim<1158:1162>|thin<1163:1167>|device<1168:1174>|already<1192:1199>|perhaps<1251:1258>|one<1268:1271>|again<1272:1277>|price<1288:1293>|thin<1329:1333>|particular<1387:1397>|case<1398:1402>|face<1416:1420>|faceplate<1416:1425>|plate<1420:1425>|deep<1429:1435>|thick<1436:1441>|thick<1436:1443>|keep<1520:1524>|mind<1533:1537>|case<1541:1545>|actually<1553:1561>|clean<1597:1602>|install<1603:1610>",

But it keep failing to add device. After connecting all wires as per instructions. I see orange and green wifi blinking, opened app, connected to tp link wifi and it takes about 2-3 mins trying to find device and eventually fails. Tried at two different location. Phone and switch are very close like next to each other. Now I can't return this since return window is closed. Support is not much helpful. They keep saying my wifi is not 2.4GHz. I said I have connected other devices which also requires 2.4GHz. And Wifi SSID I added to my router is 2.4Ghz. I highly recommend not to buy this product. It is waste of time and energy.Also it does  not fit  in if you trying to replace one of the switch in 2 or more gang switch box. It is bit bigger than the std switches and later cover plate wont fit properly. It covers the tiny switches of this switch at the bottom (reset and restart).

It connects to WiFi easily through the Kasa app, has adjustable dimmer limits, and works with Google Home to both turn on/off and to dim.The minor downsides is the size of the switch making it hard to fit it in the old boxes from the 60s which are in my house and the plate.  The plate is proprietary which seems unnecessary, and larger than it needs to be/normal Decora plates are.Overall though, I'm happy with it and plant to get a couple more of these and several of the 3 way ones.###minor<15:20>|downside<21:30>|description<77:88>|connect<94:102>|wifi<106:110>|easily<111:117>|kasa<130:134>|the kasa app<126:138>|kasa app<130:138>|adjustable<144:154>|dim<155:158>|dimmer<155:161>|limit<162:168>|google<185:191>|home<192:196>|google home<185:196>|turn<205:209>|dim<224:227>|minor<232:237>|downside<238:247>|size<255:259>|hard<284:288>|fit<292:295>|old<306:309>|box<310:315>|house<345:350>|plate<359:364>|plate<371:376>|proprietary<380:391>|large<421:427>|normal<448:454>|decora<455:461>|plate<462:467>|plate<462:468>|overall<473:480>|though<481:487>|happy<493:498>|a couple<524:532>|couple<526:532>|3 way<566:571>|one<572:576>",

The bulbs were rated as dimmable but too bright for the TV room.  So, a dimmer switch was needed.  And since I needed a dimmer for other LED bulbs around the house, the 3-pack was perfect and just a little more than buying 2 switches separately.  I have all my switches integrated with Alexa automation and I like this control better at the switch than having to control each individual light (i.e. smart bulbs).  This automation also allows me to turn the house lights on and off during vacations so the house seems occupied when away.  I do the same with smart plugs.Just be aware of a couple of things.  First, the body of the switch is very big and bulky, as are all other smart switches.  This means it's going to be a tight fit in the electrical box and you've got some maneuvering ahead of you if you have a few wires and wire nuts in the box.  It also means you need a deep box if you're installing more than one of these in the same box.  So you may need a qualified electrician if you're not comfortable with electricity.  Second, the switch itself is a single tap vs. an on/off click.  This is necessary because of the smart capability (the electronics can't physically click the switch on/off).  It's not a big deal and you get used to it very quickly.All in all, a great buy and they do work very well with Alexa integration via wireless.  And yes, the switches still work even if the wireless is out.  You just have to manually turn them on and off.###integrate<3:13>|smoothly<14:22>|alexa<28:33>|bright<72:78>|brightness<72:82>|new<88:91>|all<96:99>|instal<92:101>|ceiling<102:109>|ceiling fan<102:114>|fan<110:114>|led<122:125>|led bulb<122:131>|bulb<126:131>|bulb<138:143>|rate<149:154>|dimmable<158:166>|bright<175:181>|tv<190:192>|room<193:197>|dimmer<206:212>|dimmer<254:260>|led<271:274>|bulb<275:280>|led bulb<271:280>|house<292:297>|pack<305:309>|3 pack<303:309>|separately<368:378>|all<388:391>|rate<409:414>|integrate<404:414>|alexa<420:425>|automation<426:436>|control<453:460>|control<497:504>|individual<510:520>|smart<533:538>|bulb<539:544>|automation<553:563>|all<569:572>|allow<569:575>|turn<582:586>|house<591:596>|vacation<622:631>|house<639:644>|away<665:669>|same<681:685>|smart<691:696>|plug<697:702>|smart plug<691:702>|aware<711:716>|couple<722:728>|a couple<720:728>|first<741:746>|body<752:756>|big<779:782>|bulky<787:792>|all<801:804>|smart<811:816>|other smart switch<805:825>|mean<833:838>|tight<858:863>|fit<864:867>|tight fit<858:867>|a tight fit<856:867>|electrical<875:885>|box<886:889>|the electrical box<871:889>|electrical box<875:889>|ahead<922:927>|wire<953:957>|wire<953:958>|wire<963:967>|wire nut<963:972>|nut<968:972>|box<980:983>|mean<994:999>|deep<1011:1015>|box<1016:1019>|all<1034:1037>|instal<1030:1040>|same<1071:1075>|box<1076:1079>|the same box<1067:1079>|electrician<1110:1121>|comfortable<1136:1147>|electricity<1153:1164>|second<1167:1173>|single<1198:1204>|single tap<1198:1208>|tap<1205:1208>|click<1223:1228>|necessary<1239:1248>|smart<1264:1269>|capability<1270:1280>|electronic<1286:1297>|all<1310:1313>|physically<1304:1314>|click<1315:1320>|big<1353:1356>|big deal<1353:1361>|a big deal<1351:1361>|deal<1357:1361>|quickly<1390:1397>|all<1398:1401>|all<1405:1408>|alexa<1454:1459>|integration<1460:1471>|alexa integration<1454:1471>|wire<1476:1480>|wireless<1476:1484>|still<1509:1514>|wire<1532:1536>|wireless<1532:1540>|all<1571:1574>|manually<1567:1575>|turn<1576:1580>",

It's a bit like a GFCI outlet, though- they are fairly bulky, so there's not going to be a lot of spare room in the box.  It can be tricky to get two of these into a duplex box. (Waygo's, or very, very neat wiring are your friend)We use these with Google Home, and they work very well. The only complaint I have about the integration is setting them up twice- once in the Kasa app, and then again in Google Home. It would be great if the setup process were all in one place and just flowed through. For example, when i have \"Living Room\" in both apps, Google Home should realize that I've set up a switch in Kasa and automatically assign it to \"Living Room\" in Google. I realize that is on Google- it's just something that should be addressed.Once it is integrated, though, you can mimic a much more expensive home automation system. I've seen homes with $30k-$50K just on home automation. These switches do a darn good job of mirroring that, and they don't require a server to run them. We've set up \"scenes\" like \"Hey Google, it's time for movies\"- and then Google can address the various switches and dim the lights, close the blinds, etc. It's quite a luxurious feeling.What I particularly like about these switches is that they stay connected to our wifi pretty well. I've experimented with several other brands, and some of them will drop off the wifi on an annoyingly frequent basis. I want to install, then not think about it again. In my primary residence, we have >30 switched that have been running for about a year. Only one has ever needed to be reconnected to wifi, and that has only happened once so far. (btw, reconnecting is relatively easy, as there are reset buttons carefully hidden on the front of the device- you don't have to take it out of the wall).So all in, electronics are well designed, installation is about what you'd expect, and integration with Google Home is pretty good.  Kasa has done a very nice job with these switches.###value<13:18>|google<36:42>|install<52:59>|instal<52:61>|smart<84:89>|these smart switch<78:98>|ever<107:111>|property<114:124>|price<125:130>|par<150:153>|lutron<159:165>|dumb<167:171>|big<202:205>|box<206:209>|big box<202:209>|store<210:215>|box store<206:215>|functionality<239:252>|installation<253:265>|straightforward<269:284>|familiar<296:304>|basic<310:315>|electrical<316:326>|gfci<351:355>|outlet<356:362>|though<364:370>|fairly<381:387>|bulky<388:393>|par<432:435>|room<437:441>|box<449:452>|tricky<465:471>|box<506:509>|neat<535:539>|wiring<540:546>|google<581:587>|home<588:592>|google home<581:592>|only complaint<623:637>|complaint<628:637>|integration<655:666>|set<670:673>|set<670:677>|once<693:697>|kasa<705:709>|kasa app<705:713>|the kasa app<701:713>|again<724:729>|google<733:739>|google home<733:744>|home<740:744>|set<771:774>|setup<771:776>|process<777:784>|setup process<771:784>|place<801:806>|example<836:843>|living<858:864>|room<865:869>|living room<858:869>|google<885:891>|home<892:896>|google home<885:896>|realize<904:911>|set<922:925>|kasa<941:945>|automatically<950:963>|living<978:984>|room<985:989>|living room<978:989>|google<994:1000>|realize<1004:1011>|google<1023:1029>|address<1066:1073>|address<1066:1075>|once<1076:1080>|integrate<1087:1097>|though<1099:1105>|expensive<1133:1142>|home<1143:1147>|home automation<1143:1158>|automation<1148:1158>|automation system<1148:1165>|system<1159:1165>|home automation system<1143:1165>|home<1177:1181>|home<1177:1182>|home<1206:1210>|automation<1211:1221>|home automation<1206:1221>|job<1253:1256>|require<1291:1298>|server<1301:1307>|run<1311:1314>|set<1327:1330>|scene<1335:1341>|google<1353:1359>|google<1393:1399>|address<1404:1411>|various<1416:1423>|dim<1437:1440>|close<1453:1458>|blind<1463:1469>|feeling<1499:1506>|par<1514:1517>|particularly<1514:1526>|stay<1566:1570>|connected<1571:1580>|wifi<1588:1592>|pretty<1593:1599>|ever<1630:1634>|brand<1643:1649>|other brand<1637:1649>|drop<1673:1677>|wifi<1686:1690>|annoyingly<1697:1707>|frequent<1708:1716>|install<1734:1741>|again<1767:1772>|primary<1780:1787>|run<1835:1838>|run<1835:1842>|year<1855:1859>|ever<1874:1878>|connected<1894:1903>|reconnecte<1892:1903>|wifi<1907:1911>|happen<1931:1939>|once<1940:1944>|far<1948:1951>|btw<1954:1957>|reconnecte<1959:1971>|relatively<1975:1985>|easy<1986:1990>|reset<2005:2010>|set<2007:2010>|reset button<2005:2018>|button<2011:2018>|carefully<2019:2028>|hide<2029:2035>|front<2043:2048>|electronic<2118:2129>|design<2139:2147>|install<2149:2156>|installation<2149:2161>|integration<2194:2205>|integration with google<2194:2217>|google<2211:2217>|home<2218:2222>|google home<2211:2222>|pretty<2226:2232>|kasa<2240:2244>|job<2266:2269>",
      "Bulky switch###bulky<0:5>|||B079775ZZQ ★★☆☆☆ [2024-08-22] <b>Four problems to discuss</b> I was able to install this without too much trouble, and it fully works.  The dimming capabilities and voice/remote control are pretty cool, but here are 4 problems;#1  - Even when set to \"instant on\", there is a delay.  This make you wonder if you properly hit the switch, and sometimes you hit it again, turning it off before it ever comes on.#2 - The switch is bulky, and it is not easy to cram it into old junction boxes, especially if there is much wiring in there.#3 - The depression switch doesn't move much, so there is no significant blind feedback as to whether you successfully hit the switch.  If you are fumbling in a dark room, or reaching around a corner, the old style up and down switch provides much better tactile feedback.#4 - When hitting the switch, you sometimes hit the dimming buttons instead.  They really should not have designed it so those button are adjacent.  You have to be looking squarely at the switch to accurately hit it.  This may sound like whiny complaint, but most people are accustomed to looking where they are walking and just hitting the switch using their peripheral vision.###problem<8:16>|able<38:42>|install<46:53>|trouble<76:83>|fully<92:97>|dim<110:117>|capability<118:130>|voice<135:140>|remote<141:147>|remote control<141:155>|control<148:155>|pretty<160:166>|cool<167:171>|problem<188:196>|set<213:216>|instant<221:228>|delay<245:250>|wonder<267:273>|properly<281:289>|hit<290:293>|sometimes<310:319>|hit<324:327>|again<331:336>|turn<338:345>|ever<363:367>|bulky<396:401>|easy<417:421>|old<438:441>|junction<442:450>|box<451:456>|junction box<442:456>|especially<458:468>|wiring<486:492>|move<537:541>|significant<563:574>|blind<575:580>|feedback<581:589>|fully<615:620>|successfully<608:620>|hit<621:624>|dark<663:667>|room<668:672>|dark room<663:672>|reach<677:685>|corner<695:701>|old<707:710>|style<711:716>|down<724:728>|provide<736:744>|feedback<765:773>|hit<784:787>|hit<784:791>|sometimes<808:817>|hit<818:821>|dim<826:833>|button<834:840>|button<834:841>|instead<842:849>|design<880:888>|button<901:907>|hit<983:986>|sound<1001:1006>|complaint<1018:1027>|most<1033:1037>|people<1038:1044>|walk<1086:1093>|hit<1103:1106>|hit<1103:1110>",

I have 80-90% of my lighting automated now. I started out with a lot of Lutron's switches. They are very nice, but VERY expensive and they require a hub to work. I didn't try Kasa initially because the price was so low (especially when they put them on sale, which seems to happen frequently), that I thought they would be kind of junk.Turns out that is not the case at all. They have been great quality with a very nice app. In many respects they are better than the lutron switches. The design is nicer in my opinion, the single paddle is easier to use than the many little buttons on Lutron's. The paddle can be configured so that when you press and hold it, it turns the lights on to 100% or to a preset level, regardless of what the previous lighting level was (normally when you click it on it just goes to whatever level of lighting you left it at the last time).The reason I got it was that I replaced an overhead light fixture in my bathroom with a new LED one. It worked great with the standard, non-smart, dimmer I had. A little later I replaced it with a lutron dimmer and it would not dim to a low level without a TON of flickering. My wife really likes low light levels in there, so I decided to try the Kasa switch. It works perfect. Very, very low light level without any flicker.Just make sure you have a neutral wire in your box, it won't work without it. Usually the boxes do, but not all of them are wired that way. It's a big switch (as is the Lutron), so if the box is super tight, you might have to work a little to get the wires in there properly.###long<16:20>|neutral<35:42>|a neutral wire<33:47>|neutral wire<35:47>|wire<43:47>|all<59:62>|love<64:70>|kasa<71:75>|plug<91:96>|lighting<125:133>|automate<134:143>|now<144:147>|start<151:158>|lutron<177:183>|expensive<225:234>|require<244:251>|hub<254:257>|kasa<280:284>|all<290:293>|initially<285:294>|price<307:312>|low<320:323>|all<331:334>|especially<325:335>|put<346:349>|sale<358:362>|happen<379:385>|frequently<386:396>|kind<428:432>|junk<436:440>|turn<441:446>|case<467:471>|all<475:478>|lutron<573:579>|design<594:600>|opinion<616:623>|single<629:635>|paddle<636:642>|easy<646:652>|button<681:688>|lutron<692:698>|paddle<706:712>|configure<720:730>|press<748:753>|hold<758:762>|turn<770:775>|preset<806:812>|level<813:818>|regardless<820:830>|previous<843:851>|lighting<852:860>|level<861:866>|all<876:879>|normally<872:880>|click<890:895>|level<927:932>|lighting<936:944>|leave<949:953>|last<964:968>|reason<979:985>|replace<1006:1014>|overhead<1018:1026>|fixture<1033:1040>|light fixture<1027:1040>|bathroom<1047:1055>|new<1063:1066>|led<1067:1070>|standard<1101:1109>|non<1111:1114>|smart<1115:1120>|dim<1122:1125>|dimmer<1122:1128>|non smart dimmer<1111:1128>|smart dimmer<1115:1128>|later<1145:1150>|replace<1153:1161>|lutron<1172:1178>|dim<1179:1182>|lutron dimmer<1172:1185>|dimmer<1179:1185>|dim<1203:1206>|low<1212:1215>|level<1216:1221>|low level<1212:1221>|a ton<1230:1235>|ton<1232:1235>|flicker<1239:1246>|flickering<1239:1249>|wife<1254:1258>|all<1261:1264>|low<1272:1275>|level<1282:1287>|level<1282:1288>|decide<1304:1311>|kasa<1323:1327>|low<1365:1368>|level<1375:1380>|flicker<1393:1400>|neutral<1427:1434>|a neutral wire<1425:1439>|wire<1435:1439>|neutral wire<1427:1439>|box<1448:1451>|all<1482:1485>|usually<1479:1486>|box<1491:1494>|box<1491:1496>|all<1509:1512>|wire<1525:1529>|wire<1525:1530>|big<1548:1551>|lutron<1570:1576>|box<1589:1592>|super<1596:1601>|tight<1602:1607>|wire<1652:1656>|wire<1652:1657>|properly<1667:1675>",

Buy something else!</b> I bought this switch to complement a number of other IoT devices in my house that I control with Alexa.The installation was smooth.  You need to be aware that the dimmer requires a little more space than your typical regular switch.  You should be fine if you have a newer and larger box.The pairing with Alexa went well, and for a couple of months I was happy with the result.After a couple of months the device started intermittently turning off the lights, and then on (with the same brightness).  Sometimes it would happen 3-4 times in one evening, and some evenings it would be OK.  Until after a brief power outage the dimmer died completely.  It was still under warrantee, so I tried to contact support:- forget about phone support - you can wait for hours and nobody answers;- the online chat was marginally more helpful.  After ~45 minutes with me answering all kinds of questions they finally escalated to the US-based support/RMA.- After 5 more hours I got an email from the US (?) support requesting that I register on the website in order to get the support.  After another 15-20 minutes I am again waiting for next steps/decision.- A day later I got an email prompting me to choose how I want to pay for shipping the defective unit to TP-Link.  The prices start at $14.99 and are the responsibility of the customer.  The replacement unit would be shipped 3-5 days after receiving the defective unit (unless you want to pay double or triple).To summarize: not the best CS experience and product support.The price of a new unit is ~$18. Thus the customer has to pay almost a full price again for returning a defective unit!  I remember well when this kind of warranty service was pretty common - in the 1990s!  But I truly thought that making the customer pay for a manufacturer's failure was now in past, as it is neither fair nor acceptable business practice.  The manufacturer should take responsibility for defects in their products.  After all the price for the warranty service *is* calculated into the price of the product!Given the large selection of similar devices (including from Amazon Basics) I would highly recommend getting those, not TP-Link.  While the product is OK when it works, you will end up paying out of your pocket for any manufacturer's defect.=============Editing my review and reducing the start rating to 1 (because there is 0)After I followed all the ridiculous processes of TP-Link RMA and 2 weeks after the device malfunctioned I still don't have the replacement.1. The customer self-service portal does not update or provide any useful information.  The status of my RMA changed to 'defective unit received' 6 business days after they actually received it (I have the UPS delivery slip and the name/time).2. All of my emails with attached copies of UPS delivery and requests to honor their declared \"3-5 days after receipt\" policy remain unanswered.3. The support team is based in the Philippines  and they have *ABSOLUTELY NO ACCESS* to the US-based RMA team other than email.  This is based on their own admission.  If you call the published support number you only add yet another layer in the slow and useless communication chain.4. TP-Link reps will lie to you that they would escalate and have a supervisor call you.  Nothing at all will happen.My conclusion stands:  while TP-Link may have OK products *IT IS NOT WORTH THE HUSTLE* to deal with their support.  If you are OK to buy their Kasa products without support - go ahead.  Otherwise look for alternatives.  That's what I am going to do.###device<10:16>|warranty<36:44>|early<54:59>|number<127:133>|iot<143:146>|device<147:153>|device<147:154>|iot device<143:154>|house<161:166>|control<174:181>|alexa<187:192>|all<201:204>|installation<197:209>|smooth<214:220>|aware<238:243>|dimmer<253:259>|require<260:268>|more space<278:288>|space<283:288>|typical<299:306>|regular<307:314>|new<357:360>|new<357:362>|large<367:372>|large<367:373>|box<374:377>|pairing<382:389>|alexa<395:400>|a couple<420:428>|couple<422:428>|couple of month<422:438>|month<432:438>|happy<445:450>|result<460:466>|a couple<473:481>|couple<475:481>|month<485:491>|couple of month<475:491>|device<496:502>|start<503:508>|start<503:510>|intermittently<511:525>|turn<526:533>|same<572:576>|brightness<577:587>|sometimes<591:600>|happen<610:616>|evening<634:641>|evening<652:659>|evening<652:660>|power<698:703>|outage<704:710>|power outage<698:710>|dimmer<715:721>|die<722:726>|completely<727:737>|still<747:752>|contact<784:791>|support<792:799>|forget<802:808>|phone<815:820>|support<821:828>|wait<839:843>|hour<848:853>|online<879:885>|online chat<879:890>|chat<886:890>|all<901:904>|helpful<911:918>|minute<931:938>|answer<947:956>|all<957:960>|kind<961:965>|kind<961:966>|question<970:979>|all<988:991>|finally<985:992>|escalate<993:1001>|escalate<993:1002>|base<1013:1018>|support<1019:1026>|rma<1027:1030>|hour<1046:1051>|email<1061:1066>|an email<1058:1066>|support<1083:1090>|request<1091:1101>|register<1109:1117>|website<1125:1132>|support<1153:1160>|minute<1183:1190>|20 minute<1180:1190>|again<1196:1201>|wait<1202:1206>|wait<1202:1209>|next<1214:1218>|next step<1214:1224>|step<1219:1224>|day<1238:1241>|later<1242:1247>|email<1257:1262>|an email<1254:1262>|prompt<1263:1272>|choose<1279:1285>|pay<1300:1303>|ship<1308:1316>|defective<1321:1330>|unit<1331:1335>|defective unit<1321:1335>|tp<1339:1341>|tp link<1339:1346>|link<1342:1346>|price<1353:1358>|price<1353:1359>|start<1360:1365>|customer<1410:1418>|replacement<1425:1436>|unit<1437:1441>|ship<1451:1458>|day<1463:1466>|5 day<1461:1467>|day<1463:1467>|receive<1474:1483>|defective<1488:1497>|defective unit<1488:1502>|unit<1498:1502>|pay<1523:1526>|double<1527:1533>|experience<1575:1585>|support<1598:1605>|price<1610:1615>|new<1621:1624>|unit<1625:1629>|thus<1639:1643>|customer<1648:1656>|pay<1664:1667>|almost<1668:1674>|full<1677:1681>|price<1682:1687>|again<1688:1693>|turn<1700:1707>|return<1698:1707>|defective<1710:1719>|defective unit<1710:1724>|unit<1720:1724>|remember<1729:1737>|kind<1753:1757>|warranty<1761:1769>|service<1770:1777>|pretty<1782:1788>|common<1789:1795>|truly<1819:1824>|customer<1849:1857>|pay<1858:1861>|manufacturer<1868:1880>|failure<1883:1890>|now<1895:1898>|past<1902:1906>|fair<1925:1929>|acceptable<1934:1944>|business<1945:1953>|manufacturer<1969:1981>|defect<2013:2020>|all<2047:2050>|price<2055:2060>|warranty<2069:2077>|service<2078:2085>|price<2111:2116>|large<2142:2147>|similar<2161:2168>|device<2169:2175>|device<2169:2176>|include<2178:2187>|highly<2216:2222>|recommend<2223:2232>|end<2229:2232>|tp<2252:2254>|tp link<2252:2259>|link<2255:2259>|end<2310:2313>|pay<2317:2320>|pay<2317:2323>|manufacturer<2351:2363>|reduce<2408:2416>|start<2421:2426>|follow<2467:2475>|all<2476:2479>|ridiculous<2484:2494>|process<2495:2504>|tp<2508:2510>|tp link<2508:2515>|link<2511:2515>|rma<2516:2519>|week<2526:2531>|2 week<2524:2531>|device<2542:2548>|malfunction<2549:2562>|still<2565:2570>|replacement<2586:2597>|customer<2605:2613>|self<2614:2618>|service<2619:2626>|update<2643:2649>|provide<2653:2660>|useful<2665:2671>|information<2672:2683>|status<2690:2696>|rma<2703:2706>|change<2707:2714>|defective<2719:2728>|defective unit<2719:2733>|unit<2729:2733>|receive<2734:2742>|business<2746:2754>|day<2755:2758>|day<2755:2759>|all<2775:2778>|actually<2771:2779>|receive<2780:2788>|ups<2804:2807>|name<2830:2834>|all<2844:2847>|email<2854:2859>|email<2854:2860>|attach<2866:2874>|ups<2885:2888>|request<2902:2910>|honor<2914:2919>|day<2940:2943>|day<2940:2944>|5 day<2938:2944>|receipt<2951:2958>|policy<2960:2966>|remain<2967:2973>|support<2992:2999>|team<3000:3004>|support team<2992:3004>|base<3008:3013>|absolutely<3049:3059>|access<3063:3069>|base<3081:3086>|rma<3087:3090>|team<3091:3095>|an email<3104:3112>|email<3107:3112>|base<3123:3128>|own<3138:3141>|call<3161:3165>|all<3162:3165>|support<3180:3187>|number<3188:3194>|add<3204:3207>|yet<3208:3211>|layer<3220:3225>|slow<3233:3237>|useless<3242:3249>|communication<3250:3263>|tp<3273:3275>|tp link<3273:3280>|link<3276:3280>|rep<3281:3285>|lie<3291:3294>|escalate<3318:3326>|a supervisor<3336:3348>|supervisor<3338:3348>|all<3350:3353>|call<3349:3353>|all<3371:3374>|happen<3380:3386>|conclusion<3390:3400>|stand<3401:3407>|tp<3416:3418>|link<3419:3423>|tp link<3416:3423>|worth<3456:3461>|deal<3477:3481>|support<3493:3500>|kasa<3530:3534>|support<3552:3559>|ahead<3565:3570>|otherwise<3573:3582>|alternative<3592:3604>",
      "Large switch size###large<0:5>|size<13:17>|||B079775ZZQ ★★☆☆☆ [2020-06-28] <b>A Problematic Experience, With a Surprising Twist !</b> We purchased two Kasa HS220 dimmers, to add to the home automation devices we already use.  We are heavily invested in the Alexa platform, with Echo devices, smart plugs and Echo buttons in every room of our home, from Amazon, Meross and now TP-Link.  We care for a disabled parent at home, and Alexa has been a godsend, helping us to care for them, communicate with them even when outside the home, and giving them an easy way to notify us they need help (by pressing Echo buttons that are tied to Alexa routines we've written).The first Kasa dimmer we installed replaces an old rheostat type dimmer, controlling a ceiling fixture with ten 3.3 watt dimmable LED candleabra bulbs, for a total load of 33 watts.  These bulbs, as well as the 40-watt incandescent bulbs they replaced a year or two ago (10 x 40 watts = 400 watts), worked flawlessly on the old (dumb) dimmer.The Kasa app installed without any issues on our Android phone.  It does not appear that TP-Link offers the Kasa app for Fire tablets in Amazon's app store, which is disappointing, especially since they advertise that their devices work with Alexa.The physical installation of the dimmer into a single-gang wall box ran into problems.  The switch is so large that you have to shoehorn it into the box, which proved impossible in our case, because all the boxes in our (circa 1960) home have ground wires fastened to the outside of the boxes with screws that protrude slightly into the interior of the boxes, which is just enough to prevent installing the Kasa dimmer.  The only solution is to either try to file down the screw, or break open the wall to get access to the outside of the electrical box.The Kasa dimmer only dims the dimmable LED bulbs to around 80% of full brightness, even after trying to adjust it using the dimmer calibration feature in the Kasa app.  That's just barely enough to notice amy dimming, and is just not sufficient.  We decided to replace just one of the ten LED bulbs with an incandescent bulb, to see if that bulb dimmed any more successfully than the other eleven.  That's when we got a big surprise.  With just one of the ten bulbs being an incandescent, ALL of the bulbs dim beautifully.  No flickering, and going from almost off to full brightness smoothly and reliably, and back down to off just as smoothly.  This indicates that the LED bulbs are not the issue.  It also invalidates a comment from TP-Link support that another Amazonian's review mentioned, that only a single-bulb fixture can be successfully dimmed with the Kasa HS220 dimmer.  That is clearly not the case.So what is going on here?  Our best guess is that either the dimmer does not work correctly with low-wattage loads, or more likely, the dimmer can't handle the type of load that some dimmable LEDs present to it.  A less likely answer is that this particular dimmer is defective, which we can check by replacing it with the second HS220 we bought.Based on the dismal experiences with TP-Link support that others have posted here, I probably won't waste my time going that route, opting to just return the dimmers within Amazon's return period.  Of course, I could just mix LED and incandescent bulbs to make the HS220 happy, but since just one incandescent bulb draws more than 10 LED bulbs, that doesn't make any sense, and isn't a very elegant solution.One last thing about this TP-Link product...  The box says \"DESIGNED IN CALIFORNIA,  MADE IN VIETNAM\".  I am not impressed.  Was I supposed to be?We will update this review, if warranted.Update # 1 -  There were a few instances in the last day where the LED bulbs were getting dimmed perfectly, but the behavior didn't last.  Now, it's back to only slightly dimming the bulbs.  We've also had a few instances where all bulbs were flickering.  Maybe it's a defective dimmer after all ???###problematic<5:16>|experience<17:27>|twist<47:52>|kasa<76:80>|dim<87:90>|dimmer<87:93>|dimmer<87:94>|add<99:102>|home<110:114>|automation<115:125>|home

Physically it is a touch larger than other smart switches.  Also, I put it in a double box with another switch.  This sticks out more so that the plate no longer met the wall.  Looking online later, I found this is a common complaint and a wall plate to correct this is not in the works by the manufacturer.The KASA app is not the most intuitive but I got this to work with it.  I then set out to integrate it to Alexa.  I have other switches that Alexa controls correctly but after 4 hours of research and reloads of apps, I could not get it to respond to voice commands.  It worked using the Alexa app on the phone as a remote but it never got to voice activation.  It's like Alexa in the room could not see it.  It kept seeing the smart switch I removed but not this one.  Alexa voice integration is a known issue I found out while trying to fix this.I did this switch plus 3 other KASA switches and all had the same voice activation problem.  Somebodies app isn't working properly.  Out they come and all are going back.###voice<23:28>|activate<29:37>|installation<42:54>|easy<67:74>|wire<81:86>|house<90:95>|build<104:109>|year<116:121>|ago<122:125>|physically<128:138>|touch<147:152>|large<153:159>|smart<171:176>|other smart switch<165:185>|put<196:199>|double<208:214>|box<215:218>|stick<246:252>|plate<274:279>|long<283:289>|meet<290:293>|wall<298:302>|online<313:319>|later<320:325>|find<329:334>|common<345:351>|complaint<352:361>|wall<368:372>|wall plate<368:378>|plate<373:378>|correct<382:389>|manufacturer<422:434>|kasa<439:443>|the kasa app<435:447>|kasa app<439:447>|most<459:463>|intuitive<464:473>|set<514:517>|integrate<525:534>|alexa<541:546>|alexa<576:581>|control<582:590>|correct<591:598>|correctly<591:600>|hour<613:618>|research<622:630>|respond<674:681>|voice<685:690>|voice command<685:699>|command<691:699>|alexa<722:727>|phone<739:744>|remote<750:756>|never<764:769>|voice<777:782>|activation<783:793>|alexa<806:811>|room<819:823>|keep<846:850>|smart<862:867>|remove<877:884>|alexa<904:909>|voice<910:915>|integration<916:927>|issue<939:944>|find<947:952>|fix<973:976>|kasa<1013:1017>|other kasa switch<1007:1026>|same<1043:1047>|voice<1048:1053>|activation<1054:1064>|problem<1065:1072>|properly<1104:1112>|back<1147:1151>",

Far warning, it is quite large, so if you have a lot of wires in your box (like I did) it will be a tight fit. I replaced a regular dimmer switch, and this was larger than that overall. *Make sure you have a load and line (usually black and red) AND a neutral usually white) or this will not work.

But it would often quit responding to the Home app on my iPhone, requiring a reset.Worse, though, was that after a few months the relay died entirely.  If I turned it on from the switch itself or from the Home app, nothing would happen (not even the click of the relay).  Swapped it out for a meross which was cheaper, worked more consistently, and has not had any problems in any of my rooms yet.  I had bought one of these a few years earlier, and it had also had its relay die; I hoped things would have improved by now.###unreliable<3:13>|connection<14:24>|wi<28:30>|fi<31:33>|wi fi<28:33>|relay<42:47>|die<48:51>|die<48:52>|completely<53:63>|replace<102:111>|brown<114:119>|simple<128:134>|brown<155:160>|plate<161:167>|available<168:177>|instal<178:187>|difficulty<197:207>|big<224:227>|box<236:239>|old<246:251>|metal<252:257>|a ton<271:276>|ton<273:276>|depth<280:285>|set<295:298>|often<333:338>|quit<339:343>|respond<344:354>|home<362:366>|iphone<377:383>|require<385:394>|set<399:402>|reset<397:402>|though<410:416>|a few month<433:445>|few month<435:445>|month<439:445>|relay<450:455>|die<456:459>|die<456:460>|entirely<461:469>|turn<477:483>|home<525:529>|happen<549:555>|click<570:575>|relay<583:588>|swap<592:599>|meross<613:619>|cheap<630:637>|consistently<651:663>|problem<685:693>|any problem<681:693>|room<707:712>|yet<713:716>|a few year<745:756>|year<751:756>|few year<747:756>|early<757:764>|relay<790:795>|die<796:799>|hope<803:808>|improve<827:835>|now<839:842>"

      "Small switch###small<0:5>|||B079775ZZQ ★☆☆☆☆ [2023-10-26] <b>I guess it works for most. But NOT for us.</b> Okay. My frustration Level has dropped to just under DEFCON one so here’s the review I promised these people.Got the switch, installed it. All new wiring for a new Track Light. NICE. All done to code. Tried to connect it to my WiFi and that’s where the Heartache began.  I spent MOST of yesterday afternoon trying to troubleshoot this thing. I watched half a dozen YouTube Videos. Everyone agrees there are issues hooking these up,Yet the ease of getting it online looks pretty easy. I WAS optimistic about making this thing work.  We have VERY good Fiber Optic Internet. Like 400 mbps download.  We have a VERY good WiFi Router from Linksys.  We have a very strong home Network in a very small home. (600 square feet or so) We Stream ALL of our Television. Works fabulously. All our devices work fine on our network including Cloud connected Security Cameras.  The Switch is approximately SIX FEET from our Router. Not Far huh?  Regardless what or how many times I tried. This thing refused to connect. I turned off the 5 ghz Part of our Router because EVERYONE cited that as the issueSo much for “Smart” devices. Better Living through Technology. Right. I tried the Kasa App on my iPad Pro. No luck. I tried it on my iPhone 14 Pro. To no avail.  This morning I called TP Link Support. Their telephone sounded like a bad drive thru. But from what I COULD understand, the message was “don’t call us, try online instead”Okay, fair Dincum, I’ll try their Chat Support.  I went through SIX count them 1,2,3,4,5,6 “Agents”. They ALL tried the same tired stuff. NONE of which worked. Now this took HOURS. Uninstall the app reinstall the app. TWICE. Restart my WiFi. TWICE. Restart my iPad and iPhone. Three times. Keep trying over and over to connect. Still no solution.  One actually recommended I check and see if I had “Cellular Data” turned on on my phone. I do, but we get no cell signal because we live in a VERY deep Canyon.  Did I mention we have FANTASTIC Internet? Why should Cellular Data even be an option?  My frustration level started approaching DEFCON, so I suggested perhaps they admit I got a defective unit.  That was like bathing a Cat and giving him a pill at the same time. They REFUSE to admit that an $18 dollar switch could be defective.  So they moved me to “Level TWO” Technicians who would be calling me. Now by this time I’m HOURS into this. They seem to think I have NOTHNG else to do.  And THEN I get a Call on the Phone (Landline) from a VERY soft spoken Lady. SO soft spoken I could barely hear her VERY thick accent. Very very  VERY VERY THICK.  I IMPLORED her to admit that I’d been sold a defective $18 item. Not gonna Happen. I THINK she said we were going to “Tier Three” troubleshooting Involving some type of  Engineers!  Oh goody. I explained that I was having GREAT difficulty understanding her, and I THINK she told me we were going to continue what has now morphed into a SAGA over email.  What a joyous revelation that was!  Oh Wait!  I just received another email telling me all the hoops I now need to Jump through to get a REPLACEMENT. With an addendum saying they are not confident my issue will be fixed with a replacement. That’s as close to an admission I guess I’m gonna get. Needless to say my confidence Level in this product has not improved. If I was charging by the hour this would now be a $200+ dollar non working Smart Switch. Wish me Luck. Cheers.UPDATE. After all that drama, the offers me THIS solution. Send it back to THEM on my Nickel. And pay $14.99 for them to Ship me another one and get this…(This is the best Part). They would send me whatever they had on hand. Maybe new, maybe refurbished. Who knows? Then the cost more creative dying somehow the would refund my $14.99 and that this is “standard procedure in the industry”.  Come on now I know a Gaslight when I see one.  Hindsight being 20-20,  should have just returned it to Amazon immediately and saved the frustration…lesson learned. My Favorite UPS guy showed up today with a return label and a smile and a cookie for the dog.  I’d like to mention Amazon’s decision to use the post office rather than UPS REALLY bothers us. Private industry vs Government Employees. The Private o panty will give better service 100% of the time. And the USPS will still somehow lose Billions. And give lousy service. That’s my ten cents worth.

If you connect these to a switched outlet, beware!  You will need to mark the outlet and make sure everyone in the house knows not to plug anything but a light into the switch.  These things will burn out if you connect a vacuum or anything greater than 300 watts to it.Also, this is not a direct replacement to a single pole switch.  You'll have to power the unit (switch) so it needs a ground, a hot, a neutral and load (or red wire which goes to the fixture).These switches work with the Google home app but only the basics, like on, off and dimming capability but you don't have timer, presets, scheduling or any of the other niceties available with the switches (You can set up routines in the Google home app which will turn things on and off and dim, but these aren't the same).  You'll have to use the Kasa app for the extras and it works fine on iPhone.These switches don't work well with some dimmable light fixtures.  If you have the fixture and want to control it with these switches, I recommend you research if that fixture works well with Kasa type switches.  I've also found that Ecosmart bulbs which say they are dimmable eventually fail when connected to these switches.###control<61:68>|connect<95:102>|connect<95:104>|fixture<118:125>|light fixture<112:125>|worry<152:157>|connect<173:180>|outlet<201:207>|beware<209:215>|mark<235:239>|outlet<244:250>|house<281:286>|plug<300:304>|burn<362:366>|connect<378:385>|300 watt<420:429>|watt<424:429>|direct<456:462>|replacement<463:474>|single<480:486>|pole<487:491>|a single pole<478:491>|single pole<480:491>|single pole switch<480:498>|power<516:521>|unit<526:530>|ground<554:560>|hot<564:567>|neutral<571:578>|load<583:587>|red<592:595>|wire<596:600>|fixture<619:626>|google<657:663>|google home<657:668>|home<664:668>|the google home<653:668>|google home app<657:672>|basic<686:692>|dim<711:714>|dim<711:718>|capability<719:729>|timer<749:754>|set<759:762>|preset<756:763>|scheduling<765:775>|available<805:814>|set<842:845>|routine<849:857>|google<865:871>|the google home<861:876>|google home<865:876>|home<872:876>|google home app<865:880>|turn<892:896>|dim<919:922>|same<945:949>|kasa<976:980>|kasa app<976:984>|the kasa app<972:984>|extra<993:999>|iphone<1021:1027>|dim<1069:1072>|dimmable<1069:1077>|fixture<1084:1091>|light fixture<1078:1091>|light fixture<1078:1092>|fixture<1084:1092>|fixture<1111:1118>|control<1131:1138>|recommend<1165:1174>|research<1179:1187>|fixture<1196:1203>|kasa<1220:1224>|type<1225:1229>|find<1251:1256>|ecosmart<1262:1270>|bulb<1271:1276>|dim<1296:1299>|dimmable<1296:1304>|eventually<1305:1315>|fail<1316:1320>|connect<1326:1333>|connect<1326:1335>",

I went beyond the return window and now I’m stuck with a switch that never worked in the first place.###return<14:20>|disappointed<36:48>|fail<62:68>|box<86:89>|verify<93:101>|wiring<110:116>|still<124:129>|power<162:167>|different<204:213>|problem<235:242>|no problem<232:242>|unfortunately<248:261>|unfortunately<263:276>|away<292:296>|chance<314:320>|a chance<312:320>|install<324:331>|return<354:360>|return window<354:367>|window<361:367>|the return window<350:367>|now<372:375>|stick<380:385>|never<405:410>|first<425:430>|place<431:436>",
      "One unit showed signs of electrical failure###unit<4:8>|show<9:15>|sign<16:21>|electrical<25:35>|failure<36:43>|||B079775ZZQ ★☆☆☆☆ [2025-01-03] <b>Trash and terrible customer service do not recommend</b> I received a 3 pack of these units which was supposed to be new. One of the three units did not work which was incredibly frustrating because installing the units is not necessarily easy and dealing with electricity is not necessarily safe. I took all the necessary safety precautions and attempted to install the unit which function initially only sporadically. I thought I did something wrong and so I changed that unit to three different places in the house each time again putting my safety at risk but the unit again would only work sporadically. I tried the other two units in all those spaces taking almost an entire day trial and error trying to figure out if it was me or the unit. Ultimately it was the unit because after working initially and everything being put back in the wall and the light working suddenly after about a few minutes I heard a large explosion like sound which learned at me to look at the unit which now was no longer turned on Even though it had been on and working. I immediately cut off the power and went to examine the unit and in my mind at least I smelled fire The other unit next to it was fine but the unit which had been given me the problem the entire time was not. I definitely saw a cinch marks in the wall which told me it was not safe. I immediately pull that unit out and called customer service. After being on the phone and having them forced me to do every small stupid thing that can possibly be done such as did you turn the light switch on, did you turn the circuit breaker on, did you install the unit or is it still in the box, did you plug all four wires in, are you a human etc. Literally every stupid question you can ask and between each question the lady would leave for 1 to 2 minutes to research the next stupid question ask me after I already explain to her that I literally gone through all the trouble shooting not only that I could think of but what I can find on YouTube and Reddit as well as the Amazon guide and general Google searches and it was not me it was a unit which had not worked all day after I tried it in multiple spots and then tried other units both from their company and others and I had gone to the home Depot to find other parts to try to make this thing work. Ultimately following every instruction and using their parts when it finally did turn on it exploded and she still didn't get it because she was like can you please just try to put it back in the wall and try it again and I assume burning down my house to try to troubleshoot. When I finally got firm with her and said no she could went away again and then finally offered to contact the RMA team to have them reach out to me a few days later to tell me to go back online and fill out a form which she said she filled out and register the product and then fill out another form to request an RMA. Finally when all of that was done and it was approved I was sent an email saying that I had to pay them to send the unit back or I could use the cheapest slowest method which would be free however I would have to pay to send the old unit back to them which made no sense. They did not provide a label and this was not a old unit. This was out of the box not working and almost burned down my house and rather than use a little bit of common sense and say that could be a liability we probably should replace this unit immediately their reaction was we're not going to spend money to have you return this unit to us you have to pay out of pocket which was insane. I called to confirm with them that they were making me return the unit at my own cost and they said yes. At that point I decided to just return it to Amazon because I did not want to risk burning down my house or dealing with a company that did have basic common sense to say there's a liability to produce a product which couldn't cause a fire and someone's house which can cause obvious issues such as death and loss and that it would probably be smart to replace the unit quickly and quietly rather than \" at your own cost \". I then email them to confirm that was the case and received an email back from Rosh Hashannah V. Vasquez TP-Link RMA Support graciously allowing me to choose my own courier to send it back to them but saying that I would have to do it at my own cost. That's what prompted me to write this review because normally I would not. I ordered so much stuff from Amazon and some of it is great and unexpected and maybe I ride a review for that some of it is just mid and you take the loss. I don't even mind when something breaks it always hate to see reviews when people complain that after tons of wear and tear a cheap product broke. Generally if I get one good use out of it and it's cheap enough I don't even care it's easy enough to have another sent from prime at the cheap cost if it meant that much to me or finding another product that may suit my needs more but when your product is an actual safety hazard and your response is we don't care pay to send it back to us and put you through all the hassle that something that people should know before they purchase in my opinion.###trash<3:8>|customer<22:30>|customer service<22:38>|service<31:38>|recommend<46:55>|receive<62:70>|3

I followed the video. I couldn't make them work. The best I could get was sometimes, I could get them to turn on, but then I couldn't make them turn off. I reached out to support, who said they didn't know why that would be happening.So after MONTHS of trying each week to come back with a fresh set of eyes and try all 6 potential wiring configurations and nothing working, I called an electrician.They're faulty. There is an internal short circuit. I paid the electrician $200 to change them back to dumb lights and I'm just resigned to the fact that my kitchen will be the only non-smart room in the house.I don't care.I'm sick of these switches and sick of this company. Don't walk away, RUN AWAY!!Every other light switch I have (they are not 2 way switches) are from Wyze and the installs there were smooth and basically effortless. I had ONE out of 33 that didn't work, and customer service just sent me a new one. Overnight. It was butter compared to this struggle and expense.

      "No signs of discoloration or overheating###sign<3:8>|overheat<29:40>|||B079775ZZQ ★★☆☆☆ [2025-02-26] <b>KASA Warranty Concern</b> I purchased a large number of KASA smart switches for my new home, and have generally been satisfied with their operation.  Unfortunately, one of the HS220 switches recently failed, after having functioned normally for about 14 months.Once the switch stopped working, the switch itself appeared normal - with the circular light on the switch turning on and off as the switch was depressed.  The switch, however, no longer turned the attached 2 LED ceiling lights on or off via any of the 3 modes: depressing the switch, via the KASA App on my phone or via voice commands (Alexa).  Resetting the switch did not correct the problem, nor did turning power off at the breaker panel for ~1 minute.  Once removed, the body of the switch showed no signs of discoloration that might suggest that any of the internal circuitry had overheated.In contacting KASA for replacement of the switch under their 2-year warranty, I was given various options to return the defective switch - all of which requiring me to spend at least $14.99 (or much more) to replace the failed switch for which I paid $14.96 for when new.  The current price for a new HS220 switch on Amazon is $16.99.  Since KASA was unwilling to simply provide a no-cost return shipping label, I purchased a new HS220 switch from Amazon, and the new switch is operating normally.  I sincerely hope that the remaining 20+ KASA smart switches that I have installed do not exhibit such failures, as I would like to continue to utilize switches from a single manufacturer to simplify operation of my \"smart\" home.It is unfortunate that KASA has little interest in obtaining failed, lower price items (such as switches), both to permit them to understand the root cause of such fails and to retain customer satisfaction and loyalty.###kasa<3:7>|warranty<8:16>|concern<17:24>|large<43:48>|number<49:55>|kasa<59:63>|smart<64:69>|kasa smart switch<59:78>|new<86:89>|home<90:94>|generally<105:114>|satisfied<120:129>|operation<141:150>|unfortunately<153:166>|recently<194:202>|fail<203:209>|function<224:234>|normal<235:241>|normally<235:243>|month<257:263>|once<264:268>|stop<280:287>|appear<315:323>|normal<324:330>|turn<371:378>|however<432:439>|long<444:450>|turn<451:457>|attach<462:470>|led<473:476>|led ceiling<473:484>|ceiling<477:484>|led ceiling light<473:491>|ceiling light<477:491>|mode<519:524>|kasa<557:561>|kasa app<557:565>|the kasa app<553:565>|phone<572:577>|voice<585:590>|command<591:599>|voice command<585:599>|alexa<601:606>|reset<610:619>|correct<639:646>|problem<651:658>|turn<668:675>|power<676:681>|breaker<693:700>|panel<701:706>|minute<714:720>|once<723:727>|remove<728:735>|body<741:745>|show<760:766>|sign<770:775>|suggest<804:811>|internal<828:836>|overheat<851:861>|contact<865:875>|kasa<876:880>|replace<885:892>|replacement<885:896>|2 year<923:929>|year<925:929>|year warranty<925:938>|warranty<930:938>|give<946:951>|various<952:959>|option<960:967>|return<971:977>|defective<982:991>|require<1014:1023>|spend<1030:1035>|least<1039:1044>|replace<1070:1077>|fail<1082:1088>|pay<1108:1112>|new<1129:1132>|current<1139:1146>|price<1147:1152>|new<1159:1162>|kasa<1204:1208>|simply<1226:1232>|provide<1233:1240>|cost<1246:1250>|return<1251:1257>|shipping<1258:1266>|label<1267:1272>|new<1288:1291>|new<1326:1329>|operate<1340:1349>|normal<1350:1356>|normally<1350:1358>|hope<1373:1377>|remain<1387:1396>|kasa<1401:1405>|smart<1406:1411>|kasa smart switch<1401:1420>|instal<1433:1442>|failure<1463:1471>|continue<1492:1500>|single<1528:1534>|manufacturer<1535:1547>|operation<1560:1569>|smart<1577:1582>|home<1584:1588>|smart home<1577:1588>|kasa<1612:1616>|fail<1650:1656>|low<1658:1663>|price<1664:1669>|understand<1719:1729>|cause<1739:1744>|fail<1753:1758>|customer<1773:1781>"

Easy to install.</b> I decided to start a \"project\" to smarten up every light switch in our house.  I can't do it all at once, but I started with 3 pack of these dimmable light switches.  They worked great. Installation was easy, though I'm kind of wondering why they have 2 wires coming out of the back of the switch, but for the line and load you attach the wires directly to the side of the switch via screw terminals.  It worked fine, but they should just pick one or the other.Once installed make sure you pick the right product from the kasa app.  I was selecting the non-dimmable switch and kasa was not finding it.  Also I had to calibrate the dimming setting twice.  Not really a big deal, but I'm not sure why it doesn't work the first time.###easy<22:26>|install<30:37>|decide<45:52>|start<56:61>|project<65:72>|house<114:119>|once<143:147>|start<155:160>|start<155:162>|3 pack<168:174>|pack<170:174>|dimmable<184:192>|installation<229:241>|easy<246:250>|kind<263:267>|wonder<271:280>|wire<297:302>|back<321:325>|line<353:357>|load<362:366>|attach<371:377>|wire<382:387>|directly<388:396>|side<404:408>|screw<427:432>|screw terminal<427:442>|terminal<433:442>|pick<482:486>|once<504:508>|install<509:516>|instal<509:518>|pick<533:537>|kasa<565:569>|the kasa app<561:573>|kasa app<565:573>|select<582:591>|non<596:599>|dimmable<600:608>|kasa<620:624>|find<633:640>|calibrate<660:669>|dimming<674:681>|set<682:689>|twice<690:695>|big<711:714>|big deal<711:719>|deal<715:719>|a big deal<709:719>|first<762:767>|the first time<758:772>|first time<762:772>",

Note that the dimmer does require a neutral so make sure you have a neutral in the box. It uses wire leads for ground and neutral and screw terminals for line and load. This is odd, but works ok. Screw terminals make it easier to install in a crowded box. To use with HomeSeer, install the free TPLinkSmartHome4 plugin. With this plugin you can control the device without the Kasa mobile app and it controls the device without going through the cloud. The dimmer has a bunch of LEDS along the top that show the dim level. These Leds are not very bright which is good for not lighting up a dark room at night.###homeseer<23:31>|system<32:38>|install<46:53>|instal<46:55>|dim<75:78>|dimmer<75:81>|new<87:90>|location<91:99>|note<101:105>|dim<115:118>|dimmer<115:121>|require<127:134>|neutral<137:144>|neutral<169:176>|box<184:187>|wire<197:201>|lead<202:207>|ground<212:218>|neutral<223:230>|screw<235:240>|screw terminal<235:250>|terminal<241:250>|line<255:259>|load<264:268>|odd<278:281>|screw<297:302>|terminal<303:312>|screw terminal<297:312>|easy<321:327>|install<331:338>|crowded<344:351>|box<352:355>|homeseer<369:377>|install<379:386>|free<391:395>|plugin<413:419>|plugin<431:437>|control<446:453>|device<458:464>|kasa<477:481>|mobile<482:488>|mobile app<482:492>|control<500:507>|control<500:508>|device<513:519>|cloud<546:551>|dim<557:560>|dimmer<557:563>|a bunch<568:575>|bunch<570:575>|top<594:597>|show<603:607>|dim<612:615>|level<616:621>|dim level<612:621>|led<629:633>|bright<647:653>|dark<690:694>|room<695:699>|dark room<690:699>|night<703:708>",
      "Two pigtail wires for common and ground###pigtail<4:11>|wire<12:17>|common<22:28>|ground<33:39>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2023-08-23] <b>First Kasa Matter device</b> This is the first Matter smart device I purchased. I have purchased and use wifi, zigbee and z-wave devices and now I wanted to test out this Kasa Smart Dimmer Matter switch. Packaging was nice, less packing material compared to their other smart devices, so a plus for the environment. Comes with wire nuts, screws, face plate attached, instructions and a qr code sticker for the device. On the switch itself is the MAC number of the device and the QR code number to enter manually. The switch has only two pigtail wires and they are for common and ground. The load and line wires are screwed into terminals. I would have liked the option to have a ground screw terminal also. Less wires in the outlet box makes for an easier installation.Speaking of installation, that was simple and straight forward. Turn off you power at the breaker, test the line an install like a pro. Took me about 5 minutes to install, was going for record, just wanted to make sure it was done right. If the switch is in a multi-gang box and you are reusing your existing faceplate, then you might want to file down the bottom of the opening on the faceplate to allow access to the restart and reset button. It is a tight squeeze without trimming the faceplate and the buttons would not move to either position. I filed about 1mm off to make sure it fit properly.Once I had everything put back together it was time to connect it Kasa app, Home Assistant, Google Home and Amazon Alexa. It was simple to set-up Google Home and then share it with Home Assistant, but not so much with Amazon Alexa. I spent hours trying different configurations to share it with Amazon Alexa but it failed every time. The only way to set them up on all devices is to install on Amazon Alexa separately. All other devices can be installed and shared with Google Home. Once everything was setup all voice commands and automations are working perfectly. Given time Amazon will improve their matter support for device sharing.###first<3:8>|kasa<9:13>|matter<14:20>|device<21:27>|first<44:49>|matter<50:56>|smart<57:62>|device<63:69>|wifi<108:112>|zigbee<114:120>|z wave<125:131>|wave<127:131>|device<132:138>|device<132:139>|now<144:147>|test<160:164>|kasa<174:178>|kasa smart<174:184>|smart<179:184>|dimmer<185:191>|kasa smart dimmer<174:191>|smart dimmer<179:191>|matter<192:198>|packaging<207:216>|less<227:231>|material<240:248>|compare<249:257>|smart<273:278>|device<279:285>|other smart device<267:286>|device<279:286>|plus<293:297>|wire<330:334>|nut<335:339>|wire nut<330:339>|screw<341:346>|screw<341:347>|face<349:353>|plate<354:359>|face plate<349:359>|attach<360:368>|instruction<370:382>|qr<389:391>|qr code<389:396>|code<392:396>|a qr code<387:396>|sticker<397:404>|device<413:419>|number<453:459>|device<467:473>|qr<482:484>|code<485:489>|the qr code<478:489>|qr code<482:489>|number<490:496>|enter<500:505>|manually<506:514>|pigtail<540:547>|wire<548:552>|wire<548:553>|common<571:577>|ground<582:588>|load<594:598>|line<603:607>|wire<608:612>|wire<608:613>|screw<618:623>|screw<618:625>|terminal<631:639>|terminal<631:640>|option<665:671>|ground<682:688>|screw<689:694>|screw terminal<689:703>|terminal<695:703>|less<710:714>|wire<715:719>|wire<715:720>|outlet<728:734>|outlet box<728:738>|box<735:738>|easy<752:758>|install<759:766>|easy installation<752:771>|installation<759:771>|speak<772:780>|install<784:791>|installation<784:796>|simple<807:813>|straight<818:826>|forward<827:834>|turn<836:840>|power<849:854>|breaker<862:869>|test<871:875>|line<880:884>|install<888:895>|pro<903:906>|5 minute<922:931>|minute<924:931>|install<935:942>|multi<1032:1037>|gang<1038:1042>|a multi gang<1030:1042>|multi gang<1032:1042>|multi gang box<1032:1046>|gang box<1038:1046>|box<1043:1046>|exist<1072:1080>|face<1081:1085>|faceplate<1081:1090>|plate<1085:1090>|file<1115:1119>|bottom<1129:1135>|face<1158:1162>|faceplate<1158:1167>|plate<1162:1167>|allow<1171:1176>|access<1177:1183>|restart<1191:1198>|set<1205:1208>|reset<1203:1208>|button<1209:1215>|reset button<1203:1215>|tight<1225:1230>|trim<1247:1255>|face<1260:1264>|faceplate<1260:1269>|plate<1264:1269>|button<1278:1284>|button<1278:1285>|move<1296:1300>|position<1311:1319>|file<1323:1327>|file<1323:1328>|fit<1359:1362>|pro<1363:1366>|properly<1363:1371>|once<1372:1376>|put<1394:1397>|together<1403:1411>|connect<1427:1434>|kasa<1438:1442>|kasa app<1438:1446>|home<1448:1452>|home assistant<1448:1462>|assistant<1453:1462>|google<1464:1470>|google home<1464:1475>|home<1471:1475>|amazon alexa<1480:1492>|alexa<1487:1492>|simple<1501:1507>|set<1511:1514>|google<1518:1524>|home<1525:1529>|google home<1518:1529>|share<1539:1544>|home<1553:1557>|home assistant<1553:1567>|assistant<1558:1567>|amazon alexa<1590:1602>|alexa<1597:1602>|spend<1606:1611>|hour<1612:1617>|different<1625:1634>|configuration<1635:1649>|share<1653:1658>|amazon alexa<1667:1679>|alexa<1674:1679>|fail<1687:1693>|every time<1694:1704>|set<1722:1725>|device<1741:1747>|device<1741:1748>|install<1755:1762>|alexa<1773:1778>|amazon alexa<1766:1778>|separately<1779:1789>|device<1801:1807>|device<1801:1808>|install<1816:1823>|instal<1816:1825>|share<1830:1835>|share<1830:1836>|google<1842:1848>|home<1849:1853>|google home<1842:1853>|once<1855:1859>|set<1875:1878>|setup<1875:1880>|voice<1885:1890>|voice command<1885:1899>|command<1891:1899>|automation<1904:1915>|perfectly<1928:1937>|give<1939:1944>|pro<1964:1967>|improve<1962:1969>|matter<1976:1982>|support<1983:1990>|matter support<1976:1990>|device<1995:2001>",
      "Direct replacement for standard duplex outlet###direct<0:6>|replacement<7:18>|standard<23:31>|outlet<39:45>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★★★ [2024-02-10] <b>If You Buy One, You'll Buy More</b> I ordered a couple of Leviton smart switches last year to solve the lack of a 3-way switch issue.  That was a mistake on my part.  Now I have 15 of these devices integrated into my home.  I installed this particular outlet - a smart outlet - in my garage to make automating my outdoor Christmas yard decorations.  First, it's a direct replacement for any standard duplex outlet.  All that is needed is to hook up hot, return and ground wires and it's almost ready to go.  If you have previously installed any Leviton Wi-Fi smart device, the Wi-Fi pairing happens automatically.  If this is the first one installed, then manual Wi-Fi configuration is also very easy.  Once it's paired with your Wi-Fi, then all you need to do is set-up a schedule in the Leviton app.  The outlet is hot on the lower half and switched on the upper half, just like a typical switched outlet is wired.  A push button on the face allows the upper outlet to be turned on manually.  Bottomline:  quality device, easy to install and a great app for setting up schedules and other routines.  Just beware, you'll want more if you install one!!###couple<51:57>|a couple<49:57>|leviton<61:68>|smart<69:74>|leviton smart switch<61:83>|last<84:88>|year<89:93>|solve<97:102>|lack<107:111>|3 way<117:122>|3 way switch<117:129>|issue<130:135>|mistake<149:156>|part<163:167>|now<170:173>|device<193:199>|device<193:200>|integrate<201:211>|home<220:224>|install<229:236>|instal<229:238>|part<244:248>|particular<244:254>|outlet<255:261>|smart<266:271>|outlet<272:278>|garage<287:293>|automate<302:312>|outdoor<316:323>|christmas<324:333>|decoration<339:350>|fi<353:355>|first<353:358>|direct<367:373>|replacement<374:385>|standard<394:402>|outlet<410:416>|hook<444:448>|hot<452:455>|return<457:463>|ground<468:474>|wire<475:480>|ground wire<468:480>|almost<490:496>|ready<497:502>|previously<523:533>|install<534:541>|instal<534:543>|leviton<548:555>|wi<556:558>|wi fi<556:561>|fi<559:561>|smart<562:567>|device<568:574>|wi<580:582>|fi<583:585>|the wi fi<576:585>|wi fi<580:585>|pairing<586:593>|happen<594:601>|automatically<602:615>|first<633:638>|install<643:650>|instal<643:652>|manual<659:665>|wi<666:668>|fi<669:671>|wi fi<666:671>|configuration<672:685>|easy<699:703>|pair<716:722>|wi<733:735>|fi<736:738>|wi fi<733:738>|set<767:770>|schedule<776:784>|leviton<792:799>|the leviton app<788:803>|leviton app<792:803>|outlet<810:816>|hot<820:823>|low<831:836>|half<837:841>|low half<831:841>|upper<862:867>|half<868:872>|typical<886:893>|outlet<903:909>|wire<913:918>|push<923:927>|button<928:934>|face<942:946>|allow<947:953>|upper<958:963>|outlet<964:970>|turn<977:983>|manual<987:993>|manually<987:995>|device<1019:1025>|easy<1027:1031>|install<1035:1042>|set<1063:1066>|set<1063:1070>|schedule<1074:1082>|schedule<1074:1083>|routine<1094:1102>|beware<1110:1116>|install<1142:1149>",

      "Screws and anchor plates for wire connection###screw<0:6>|plate<18:24>|wire<29:33>|connection<34:44>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2018-12-19] <b>These are the best brand of smart switches out here.  Potentially extra work to install them though.</b> Originally had Belkin Wemo smart dimmers installed, but I had too many issues with them and finally replaced them with dimmer switches that actually work.Setup was a breeze, but installation was slightly annoying for me.  The other TP-link switches I have installed had wires extending out that you connected via wire nuts, so you could bundle multiples of these in the same switch box.  This one had screws and anchor plates on the side that required wires be inserted and screwed down to make the connection.  It required me to split some speaker wire, and connect the split wires from the neutral to the devices.  It's not pretty, but it works, and it's hidden behind the cover plate.  I take off a star for that.  If I could do a half star, I would because it wasn't that much of an inconvenience for me.Operation-wise, these work as designed.  I have Kasa smart switches all over my house and I've only ever had good experiences with setup and configuration.  These integrate wonderfully into Alexa, and are quick to respond.Don't mess around with other smart switches that require you to get a hub, get these and be done with it.  You'll be glad you did.###brand<22:27>|smart<31:36>|all<64:67>|potentially<57:68>|extra<69:74>|install<83:90>|all<87:90>|though<96:102>|all<114:117>|originally<108:118>|wemo<130:134>|smart<135:140>|dimmer<141:147>|smart dimmer<135:148>|dimmer<141:148>|install<149:156>|all<153:156>|instal<149:158>|issue<179:185>|all<203:206>|finally<200:207>|replace<208:216>|dimmer<227:233>|all<252:255>|actually<248:256>|setup<262:267>|a breeze<272:280>|breeze<274:280>|all<290:293>|install<286:293>|installation<286:298>|slightly<303:311>|annoying<312:320>|tp<340:342>|link<343:347>|tp link<340:347>|tp link switch<340:356>|all<368:371>|install<364:371>|instal<364:373>|wire<378:382>|wire<378:383>|connect<407:414>|connect<407:416>|wire<421:425>|wire nut<421:430>|nut<426:430>|multiple<452:461>|same<478:482>|box<490:493>|one<501:504>|screw<509:515>|plate<527:532>|plate<527:533>|side<541:545>|require<551:558>|require<551:559>|wire<560:564>|wire<560:565>|screw<582:589>|connect<607:614>|connection<607:617>|require<623:630>|require<623:631>|split<638:643>|speaker<649:656>|wire<657:661>|connect<667:674>|split<679:684>|wire<685:689>|wire<685:690>|neutral<700:707>|device<715:722>|pretty<734:740>|hide<765:771>|cover<783:788>|plate<789:794>|the cover plate<779:794>|cover plate<783:794>|half<842:846>|operation<916:925>|design<946:954>|kasa<964:968>|smart<969:974>|kasa smart switch<964:983>|all<984:987>|house<996:1001>|ever<1016:1020>|experience<1030:1041>|setup<1047:1052>|configuration<1057:1070>|integrate<1079:1088>|alexa<1106:1111>|quick<1121:1126>|respond<1130:1137>|mess<1144:1148>|smart<1167:1172>|other smart switch<1161:1181>|require<1187:1194>|hub<1208:1211>|one<1231:1234>",

Why do they have to make the line wire and load wire so difficult to connect. There other products have all four wires out for connection. But on this device you have to fumble around to connect it. On top of that there is a good 10 second delay between my Alexa device and the turning off of the lights.

      "No ground screw terminal###ground<3:9>|screw<10:15>|terminal<16:24>|screw terminal<10:24>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2023-08-23] <b>First Kasa Matter device</b> This is the first Matter smart device I purchased. I have purchased and use wifi, zigbee and z-wave devices and now I wanted to test out this Kasa Smart Dimmer Matter switch. Packaging was nice, less packing material compared to their other smart devices, so a plus for the environment. Comes with wire nuts, screws, face plate attached, instructions and a qr code sticker for the device. On the switch itself is the MAC number of the device and the QR code number to enter manually. The switch has only two pigtail wires and they are for common and ground. The load and line wires are screwed into terminals. I would have liked the option to have a ground screw terminal also. Less wires in the outlet box makes for an easier installation.Speaking of installation, that was simple and straight forward. Turn off you power at the breaker, test the line an install like a pro. Took me about 5 minutes to install, was going for record, just wanted to make sure it was done right. If the switch is in a multi-gang box and you are reusing your existing faceplate, then you might want to file down the bottom of the opening on the faceplate to allow access to the restart and reset button. It is a tight squeeze without trimming the faceplate and the buttons would not move to either position. I filed about 1mm off to make sure it fit properly.Once I had everything put back together it was time to connect it Kasa app, Home Assistant, Google Home and Amazon Alexa. It was simple to set-up Google Home and then share it with Home Assistant, but not so much with Amazon Alexa. I spent hours trying different configurations to share it with Amazon Alexa but it failed every time. The only way to set them up on all devices is to install on Amazon Alexa separately. All other devices can be installed and shared with Google Home. Once everything was setup all voice commands and automations are working perfectly. Given time Amazon will improve their matter support for device sharing.###first<3:8>|kasa<9:13>|matter<14:20>|device<21:27>|first<44:49>|matter<50:56>|smart<57:62>|device<63:69>|wifi<108:112>|zigbee<114:120>|z wave<125:131>|wave<127:131>|device<132:138>|device<132:139>|now<144:147>|test<160:164>|kasa<174:178>|kasa smart<174:184>|smart<179:184>|dimmer<185:191>|kasa smart dimmer<174:191>|smart dimmer<179:191>|matter<192:198>|packaging<207:216>|less<227:231>|material<240:248>|compare<249:257>|smart<273:278>|device<279:285>|other smart device<267:286>|device<279:286>|plus<293:297>|wire<330:334>|nut<335:339>|wire nut<330:339>|screw<341:346>|screw<341:347>|face<349:353>|plate<354:359>|face plate<349:359>|attach<360:368>|instruction<370:382>|qr<389:391>|qr code<389:396>|code<392:396>|a qr code<387:396>|sticker<397:404>|device<413:419>|number<453:459>|device<467:473>|qr<482:484>|code<485:489>|the qr code<478:489>|qr code<482:489>|number<490:496>|enter<500:505>|manually<506:514>|pigtail<540:547>|wire<548:552>|wire<548:553>|common<571:577>|ground<582:588>|load<594:598>|line<603:607>|wire<608:612>|wire<608:613>|screw<618:623>|screw<618:625>|terminal<631:639>|terminal<631:640>|option<665:671>|ground<682:688>|screw<689:694>|screw terminal<689:703>|terminal<695:703>|less<710:714>|wire<715:719>|wire<715:720>|outlet<728:734>|outlet box<728:738>|box<735:738>|easy<752:758>|install<759:766>|easy installation<752:771>|installation<759:771>|speak<772:780>|install<784:791>|installation<784:796>|simple<807:813>|straight<818:826>|forward<827:834>|turn<836:840>|power<849:854>|breaker<862:869>|test<871:875>|line<880:884>|install<888:895>|pro<903:906>|5 minute<922:931>|minute<924:931>|install<935:942>|multi<1032:1037>|gang<1038:1042>|a multi gang<1030:1042>|multi gang<1032:1042>|multi gang box<1032:1046>|gang box<1038:1046>|box<1043:1046>|exist<1072:1080>|face<1081:1085>|faceplate<1081:1090>|plate<1085:1090>|file<1115:1119>|bottom<1129:1135>|face<1158:1162>|faceplate<1158:1167>|plate<1162:1167>|allow<1171:1176>|access<1177:1183>|restart<1191:1198>|set<1205:1208>|reset<1203:1208>|button<1209:1215>|reset button<1203:1215>|tight<1225:1230>|trim<1247:1255>|face<1260:1264>|faceplate<1260:1269>|plate<1264:1269>|button<1278:1284>|button<1278:1285>|move<1296:1300>|position<1311:1319>|file<1323:1327>|file<1323:1328>|fit<1359:1362>|pro<1363:1366>|properly<1363:1371>|once<1372:1376>|put<1394:1397>|together<1403:1411>|connect<1427:1434>|kasa<1438:1442>|kasa app<1438:1446>|home<1448:1452>|home assistant<1448:1462>|assistant<1453:1462>|google<1464:1470>|google home<1464:1475>|home<1471:1475>|amazon alexa<1480:1492>|alexa<1487:1492>|simple<1501:1507>|set<1511:1514>|google<1518:1524>|home<1525:1529>|google home<1518:1529>|share<1539:1544>|home<1553:1557>|home assistant<1553:1567>|assistant<1558:1567>|amazon alexa<1590:1602>|alexa<1597:1602>|spend<1606:1611>|hour<1612:1617>|different<1625:1634>|configuration<1635:1649>|share<1653:1658>|amazon alexa<1667:1679>|alexa<1674:1679>|fail<1687:1693>|every time<1694:1704>|set<1722:1725>|device<1741:1747>|device<1741:1748>|install<1755:1762>|alexa<1773:1778>|amazon alexa<1766:1778>|separately<1779:1789>|device<1801:1807>|device<1801:1808>|install<1816:1823>|instal<1816:1825>|share<1830:1835>|share<1830:1836>|google<1842:1848>|home<1849:1853>|google home<1842:1853>|once<1855:1859>|set<1875:1878>|setup<1875:1880>|voice<1885:1890>|voice command<1885:1899>|command<1891:1899>|automation<1904:1915>|perfectly<1928:1937>|give<1939:1944>|pro<1964:1967>|improve<1962:1969>|matter<1976:1982>|support<1983:1990>|matter support<1976:1990>|device<1995:2001>",

However, installation comes with some gotchas that I feel are unique to this product. For one, at least for me, \"line\" and \"load\" were the opposite of what colors the wiring in my wall indicated. Secondly, there is a riser under the screws that the wires need to go UNDER for the switch to work properly. Knowing this beforehand would have saved me some time and trouble, but after a few tries I got things working.Thankfully, setup with the app was very simple. I do wish there was a way to customize the dimming as my light doesn't turn on until the dimmer is set to about 65%. The app seems to allow this, but it never works for me. I'm not sure what it actually does.###deal<9:13>|design<18:26>|affordable<56:66>|dimmable<86:94>|smart<111:116>|house<117:122>|however<134:141>|installation<143:155>|feel<187:191>|unique<196:202>|least<232:237>|line<247:251>|load<258:262>|color<290:296>|wiring<301:307>|wall<314:318>|indicate<319:328>|screw<367:373>|wire<383:388>|properly<429:437>|save<474:479>|trouble<497:504>|thankfully<549:559>|set<561:564>|setup<561:566>|simple<589:595>|wish<602:606>|customize<626:635>|dimming<640:647>|turn<668:672>|dimmer<686:692>|set<696:699>|allow<731:736>|never<750:755>|actually<791:799>",

Requires app for install and updates.</b> These are smart / WiFi dimmers that are hard-wired into a junction box for switched lights.Only supports 2.4 Ghz WifI band -- some of the hardware variants used in individual dimmers will stay connected indefinitely and some will disconnect and reconnect randomly and as frequently every few minutes.  It apparently has to do with the WiFi chips, firmware, or both.Sometimes the brightness level LEDs on the top if the dimmer will get stuck and stay on and at other times, they turn off after a few seconds.Alexa integration is OK for basic functions, but gets complicated rapidly as the number of named devices increases. You will need to come up with creative names if, for example, you have more than one dimmer per named room and then you will have to remember which are which. There is no alexa integration for calibration. firmware updates, or time or time zone adjustments.These dimmers work for most light sources:  incandescent (but wattage is limited to 200) and some dimmable fluorescent and some LED bulbs.Requires an app for initial installation, dimmer calibration, and for firmware or time updates.There is no easy reference source on the product page for bulb compatibility, so be sure you test your bulbs before going to the trouble to install these dimmers.Worked poorly on Feit LED candelabra bulbs: there was noticeable bulb flickering at dimming levels below 60 percent.Single pole (one switch) only.  Requires a neutral and ground connection, so there will be four wire connections per dimmer (green, white, and two for the controlled device).  Oddly, the green and white connections require wire nuts but the line and load are screwed into the side of the dimmer.Large back cover uses a lot of space in the junction box, so not the best choice for small or crowded junction boxes.The front up and down controls are too small and should be bigger.The indicator LED bulb is very dim and cannot be seen in a bright room.  A dimmable indicator on a dimmer would have been be a logical design choice, but it's not available on this model.There still is no web interface for these smart dimmers -- only app controls.  The Apple app does not support accessibility options and is not suitable for those with vision issues -- moreover, the contrast and size on the app screens is very poor even for those with good vision -- especially if your Apple device uses adaptive backlighting.There is a removable, screwless faceplate which is a nice feature. The face plate and switch front are a high gloss finish that shows fingerprints and scratches; a matte finish would be much better.There are two very small, unmarked and hard-to-access switches built into the dimmer bottom.  One reboots the dimmer without removing the programming and account information. The other wipes the device and removes it from an account.For those who prefer a flawless installation, be sure that the dimmer is not angled when you screw it into the junction box.  If there is any angle, the face plate will not fit flush with the dimmer. This is especially important if there are more than one switch or dimmer in a junction

It requires 2 black, 1 White and a ground wire to work.  Many homes do not have the a neutral wire.  On this switch it is a white wire and then it has 2 black wires.  The idea is that the smart switches need to have power even when power is turned off to the light.  The description on this should warn that it requires this to avoid purchase mistakes.###require<3:11>|wire<14:18>|connection<19:29>|description<38:49>|description<38:50>|mention<73:80>|require<94:101>|wire<106:110>|connection<111:121>|require<127:134>|require<127:135>|black<138:143>|white<147:152>|ground<159:165>|ground wire<159:170>|wire<166:170>|home<186:191>|neutral<210:217>|a neutral wire<208:222>|wire<218:222>|neutral wire<210:222>|white<248:253>|wire<254:258>|white wire<248:258>|black<277:282>|wire<283:287>|wire<283:288>|black wire<277:288>|idea<295:299>|smart<312:317>|power<340:345>|power<356:361>|turn<365:371>|description<395:406>|warn<422:426>|require<435:442>|require<435:443>|avoid<452:457>|mistake<467:475>"

      "HS220 has house wires screwed into the side###house<10:15>|wire<16:21>|screw<22:29>|side<39:43>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2019-10-02] <b>Works great</b> I have installed 4 of the HS220 and 6 of the HS200. These work great. Installation on the first one was a little complicated but after that it became easy. The only trouble is trying to fit 3 in a box with all the wires and wires. It takes time a finesse as well as some trial and error with putting wall plate on to make sure they are all straight. But that's to be expected. The control area is larger than a normal switch so the space becomes limited. The HS220 are nice because the house wires screw into the side of the switch but the HS200 have all the wires come out of the switch and have to be installed with wire nuts. I did have problems with the switches disconnecting from my router on several occasions but after doing some research I Purchased a placed all of my smart home products on a AC1900Nighthawk WiFi Mesh Extender that is wired so im not using the mesh feature. I have not had a problem. I have 22 wifi wall switches, 3 ceiling fan switches and multiple wall plugs all on the same router and it has not had any problems since I put everything on its own router. The install is easy with a house that's only 14 years old and has common wire-White wire-. Once your have set up the Kasa app and linked a switch its really easy to link any new switches you install. I also have WEMO switches and a few other brands on the same network and have had no problems with any of them interfering with each other. Everything is connected with Alexa and works great. I have different routines set up for different lights and wall plugs which makes it so nice. Some lights turn on at dusk and turn off at dawn and others turn on and off at random times. Notifications of what is doing what when I'm not home is nice because I then know who is home. The dimmers are nice because once installed you can test the dimmer function with the specific lights. All lights are different. LED use less power and are brighter than incandescent bulbs so during the setup it will let you adjust the minimum dimness you want and after that it remembers how low is the lowest setting.###all<30:33>|install<26:33>|instal<26:35>|all<93:96>|installation<89:101>|first<109:114>|one<115:118>|the first one<105:118>|complicated<132:143>|become<162:168>|easy<169:173>|trouble<184:191>|fit<205:208>|box<216:219>|all<225:228>|wire<233:237>|wire<233:238>|wire<243:247>|wire<243:248>|trial<290:295>|error<300:305>|put<311:314>|put<311:318>|wall<319:323>|all<320:323>|wall plate<319:329>|plate<324:329>|all<355:358>|straight<359:367>|control<400:407>|area<408:412>|large<416:422>|normal<430:436>|a normal switch<428:443>|space<451:456>|become<457:464>|limited<465:472>|house<505:510>|wire<511:515>|wire<511:516>|screw<517:522>|side<532:536>|all<570:573>|wire<578:582>|wire<578:583>|all<626:629>|install<622:629>|instal<622:631>|wire<637:641>|nut<642:646>|wire nut<637:646>|problem<659:666>|problem<659:667>|disconnect<686:699>|router<708:714>|occasion<726:735>|research<757:765>|place<780:786>|all<787:790>|smart<797:802>|home<803:807>|smart home<797:807>|wifi<838:842>|mesh<843:847>|extender<848:856>|wire<865:869>|wire<865:870>|mesh<891:895>|feature<896:903>|problem<922:929>|wifi<941:945>|wall<946:950>|all<947:950>|ceiling<963:970>|fan<971:974>|ceiling fan<963:974>|multiple<988:996>|all<998:1001>|wall<997:1001>|plug<1002:1007>|all<1008:1011>|same<1019:1023>|router<1024:1030>|problem<1054:1061>|any problem<1050:1062>|problem<1054:1062>|put<1071:1074>|own<1093:1096>|router<1097:1103>|install<1109:1116>|all<1113:1116>|easy<1120:1124>|house<1132:1137>|year<1153:1158>|old<1159:1162>|common<1171:1177>|wire<1178:1182>|white<1183:1188>|wire<1189:1193>|once<1196:1200>|set<1211:1214>|kasa<1222:1226>|kasa app<1222:1230>|the kasa app<1218:1230>|link<1235:1239>|link<1235:1241>|all<1257:1260>|easy<1262:1266>|link<1270:1274>|new<1279:1282>|install<1296:1303>|all<1300:1303>|wemo<1317:1321>|other brand<1341:1353>|brand<1347:1353>|same<1361:1365>|network<1366:1373>|problem<1390:1397>|problem<1390:1398>|no problem<1387:1398>|interfere<1416:1427>|connect<1459:1468>|alexa<1474:1479>|different<1504:1513>|routine<1514:1522>|set<1523:1526>|different<1534:1543>|wall<1555:1559>|all<1556:1559>|plug<1560:1565>|turn<1602:1606>|dusk<1613:1617>|turn<1622:1626>|dawn<1634:1638>|turn<1650:1654>|random<1669:1675>|notification<1683:1696>|home<1732:1736>|home<1772:1776>|dimmer<1782:1788>|dimmer<1782:1789>|once<1807:1811>|install<1812:1819>|all<1816:1819>|instal<1812:1821>|test<1830:1834>|dimmer<1839:1845>|function<1846:1854>|the dimmer function<1835:1854>|specific<1864:1872>|all<1881:1884>|different<1896:1905>|lead<1907:1910>|less<1915:1919>|power<1920:1925>|bright<1934:1942>|incandescent<1948:1960>|bulb<1961:1966>|set<1981:1984>|setup<1981:1986>|let<1995:1998>|adjust<2003:2009>|minimum<2014:2021>|dimness<2022:2029>|remember<2057:2066>|low<2071:2074>|low<2082:2085>|low<2082:2088>|set<2089:2092>|the low setting<2078:2096>|setting<2089:2096>|low setting<2082:2096>",
      "Load and line wires use screw terminals###load<0:4>|line<9:13>|wire<14:19>|screw<24:29>|terminal<30:39>|screw terminal<24:39>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2023-08-23] <b>First Kasa Matter device</b> This is the first Matter smart device I purchased. I have purchased and use wifi, zigbee and z-wave devices and now I wanted to test out this Kasa Smart Dimmer Matter switch. Packaging was nice, less packing material compared to their other smart devices, so a plus for the environment. Comes with wire nuts, screws, face plate attached, instructions and a qr code sticker for the device. On the switch itself is the MAC number of the device and the QR code number to enter manually. The switch has only two pigtail wires and they are for common and ground. The load and line wires are screwed into terminals. I would have liked the option to have a ground screw terminal also. Less wires in the outlet box makes for an easier installation.Speaking of installation, that was simple and straight forward. Turn off you power at the breaker, test the line an install like a pro. Took me about 5 minutes to install, was going for record, just wanted to make sure it was done right. If the switch is in a multi-gang box and you are reusing your existing faceplate, then you might want to file down the bottom of the opening on the faceplate to allow access to the restart and reset button. It is a tight squeeze without trimming the faceplate and the buttons would not move to either position. I filed about 1mm off to make sure it fit properly.Once I had everything put back together it was time to connect it Kasa app, Home Assistant, Google Home and Amazon Alexa. It was simple to set-up Google Home and then share it with Home Assistant, but not so much with Amazon Alexa. I spent hours trying different configurations to share it with Amazon Alexa but it failed every time. The only way to set them up on all devices is to install on Amazon Alexa separately. All other devices can be installed and shared with Google Home. Once everything was setup all voice commands and automations are working perfectly. Given time Amazon will improve their matter support for device sharing.###first<3:8>|kasa<9:13>|matter<14:20>|device<21:27>|first<44:49>|matter<50:56>|smart<57:62>|device<63:69>|wifi<108:112>|zigbee<114:120>|z wave<125:131>|wave<127:131>|device<132:138>|device<132:139>|now<144:147>|test<160:164>|kasa<174:178>|kasa smart<174:184>|smart<179:184>|dimmer<185:191>|kasa smart dimmer<174:191>|smart dimmer<179:191>|matter<192:198>|packaging<207:216>|less<227:231>|material<240:248>|compare<249:257>|smart<273:278>|device<279:285>|other smart device<267:286>|device<279:286>|plus<293:297>|wire<330:334>|nut<335:339>|wire nut<330:339>|screw<341:346>|screw<341:347>|face<349:353>|plate<354:359>|face plate<349:359>|attach<360:368>|instruction<370:382>|qr<389:391>|qr code<389:396>|code<392:396>|a qr code<387:396>|sticker<397:404>|device<413:419>|number<453:459>|device<467:473>|qr<482:484>|code<485:489>|the qr code<478:489>|qr code<482:489>|number<490:496>|enter<500:505>|manually<506:514>|pigtail<540:547>|wire<548:552>|wire<548:553>|common<571:577>|ground<582:588>|load<594:598>|line<603:607>|wire<608:612>|wire<608:613>|screw<618:623>|screw<618:625>|terminal<631:639>|terminal<631:640>|option<665:671>|ground<682:688>|screw<689:694>|screw terminal<689:703>|terminal<695:703>|less<710:714>|wire<715:719>|wire<715:720>|outlet<728:734>|outlet box<728:738>|box<735:738>|easy<752:758>|install<759:766>|easy installation<752:771>|installation<759:771>|speak<772:780>|install<784:791>|installation<784:796>|simple<807:813>|straight<818:826>|forward<827:834>|turn<836:840>|power<849:854>|breaker<862:869>|test<871:875>|line<880:884>|install<888:895>|pro<903:906>|5 minute<922:931>|minute<924:931>|install<935:942>|multi<1032:1037>|gang<1038:1042>|a multi gang<1030:1042>|multi gang<1032:1042>|multi gang box<1032:1046>|gang box<1038:1046>|box<1043:1046>|exist<1072:1080>|face<1081:1085>|faceplate<1081:1090>|plate<1085:1090>|file<1115:1119>|bottom<1129:1135>|face<1158:1162>|faceplate<1158:1167>|plate<1162:1167>|allow<1171:1176>|access<1177:1183>|restart<1191:1198>|set<1205:1208>|reset<1203:1208>|button<1209:1215>|reset button<1203:1215>|tight<1225:1230>|trim<1247:1255>|face<1260:1264>|faceplate<1260:1269>|plate<1264:1269>|button<1278:1284>|button<1278:1285>|move<1296:1300>|position<1311:1319>|file<1323:1327>|file<1323:1328>|fit<1359:1362>|pro<1363:1366>|properly<1363:1371>|once<1372:1376>|put<1394:1397>|together<1403:1411>|connect<1427:1434>|kasa<1438:1442>|kasa app<1438:1446>|home<1448:1452>|home assistant<1448:1462>|assistant<1453:1462>|google<1464:1470>|google home<1464:1475>|home<1471:1475>|amazon alexa<1480:1492>|alexa<1487:1492>|simple<1501:1507>|set<1511:1514>|google<1518:1524>|home<1525:1529>|google home<1518:1529>|share<1539:1544>|home<1553:1557>|home assistant<1553:1567>|assistant<1558:1567>|amazon alexa<1590:1602>|alexa<1597:1602>|spend<1606:1611>|hour<1612:1617>|different<1625:1634>|configuration<1635:1649>|share<1653:1658>|amazon alexa<1667:1679>|alexa<1674:1679>|fail<1687:1693>|every time<1694:1704>|set<1722:1725>|device<1741:1747>|device<1741:1748>|install<1755:1762>|alexa<1773:1778>|amazon alexa<1766:1778>|separately<1779:1789>|device<1801:1807>|device<1801:1808>|install<1816:1823>|instal<1816:1825>|share<1830:1835>|share<1830:1836>|google<1842:1848>|home<1849:1853>|google home<1842:1853>|once<1855:1859>|set<1875:1878>|setup<1875:1880>|voice<1885:1890>|voice command<1885:1899>|command<1891:1899>|automation<1904:1915>|perfectly<1928:1937>|give<1939:1944>|pro<1964:1967>|improve<1962:1969>|matter<1976:1982>|support<1983:1990>|matter support<1976:1990>|device<1995:2001>",
      "Gen1 switches use screw terminals###screw<18:23>|terminal<24:33>|screw terminal<18:33>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★★☆ [2021-07-09] <b>Used for nearly every switch in my house.</b> I have some version of these switches controlling nearly everything in my house.  I started replacing my switches a few years ago with the Gen1 switches and just recently finished out with the Gen2.  The only switches that aren't these are my bathroom exhaust fans.  I've written quite a lot here so congrats if you make it through to the end.The switches I have in use now are:DW6HD (Gen1 600W Dimmer)DW1KD (1000W Dimmer, Gen1 but still uses leads instead of screws)DW15S (Gen1 Switch)DW4SF (Gen1 4 Speed Fan Controller, also uses leads over screws)D26HD (Gen2 600W Dimmer)D215S (Gen2 Switch)DAWDC (Gen2 wireless dimmer companion)DAWSC (Gen2 wireless switch companion)Overall I am very happy with my switches.  I have not had issues with constant dropping as some have said here.  The app works well and I really like the Away feature in it though the same can be accomplished through Alexa.  Integration with Alexa works fine.  Alexa usually picks up a new switch and let's me know it's connected before I can finish entering the name I want for the device.  That's not an issue as it updates automatically once I enter the name I like.  They also integrate well with Samsung SmartThings.  I use that as I was accidentally sent some ZWave Leviton switches when I ordered WiFi ones so I put them to use rather than throwing them away as Amazon suggested.  I also really like that for anyone visiting they work just as you'd expect a normal switch to vs using something like smart bulbs where if the power gets cut things can go a bit funny.  My OCD also likes that these don't stick out/lean one way or the other when switched on/off.  They're very unassuming looking which to me is good.My house is only a few years old, none of the switch boxes are metal and just about everywhere has a neutral wire already in the box.  The only places I had issues were in some of the 3-way switches where whoever wired the house seemed to cut some corners and didn't run all the wiring these require, along with not keeping things in their standard place (e.g. red wire hot, black wire traveler, etc.)  so for a while some of my 3-way switches weren't 3-way.  The Gen2 wireless switch companions remedied this though.Like many others, in general I prefer the screw terminals.  However, there were a couple of instances where having the leads was handy.  For the neutral wire I did like using the lead as it is more flexible than cutting a piece of 14/2 and using that.  In my kitchen dual gang box, which was very crowded even before I changed the switches, it did actually save me some space as I could get rid of the extra rigid wiring and use the existing wire nut already in the box on the house neutrals so I wasn't adding anything.  The other instance I preferred the leads was in a bedroom.  Whoever wired the boxes liked to strip a portion of the hot wire, loop that around the hot terminal on the switch and then terminate the hot wire on the second switch in the box rather than using a wire nut with two leads coming off of it.  Both switches were connected on a continuous hot wire.  I was able to cut the wire down to the stripped part and then just nut both switch hot/black wires to the house hot wire.  The looping method they used is a pain with the screw terminals on the Gen1, but I've made it work before.  The leads made that easier however, overall I would prefer the screw terminals.The wireless switch/dimmer companions are awesome.  They solved my 3-way wiring issue and are super easy to setup.  I was afraid there may be some delay after pushing the rocker, but it's an instant response.  If you're using Gen2 switches and wish you had a 3-way light somewhere you don't these make a really easy fix for that especially since you can stick them to a bare wall with the included adhesive pads.  Hopefully the battery life lives up to the stated 5 years, but I won't hold my breath.I also really like the fan controllers.  I have pull chain ceiling fans without remotes in all bedrooms and the living room and these make it really to control the fan speed either with the switch itself, voice, or an app.  Much better than my short wife trying to stand on something to pull the chain.Gen1 vs Gen2As stated above, overall I like the screw terminals better than the leads on the Gen 2.Updating the switch firmware is easier on Gen2.  In the My Leviton app you can choose to Update All Gen2 switches at once.  For Gen1 switches you have to do them individually still.  Gets old fast when you have a lot of them.  The addition of the wireless switch companions for Gen2 is great.  I don't use Apple Homekit so I can't speak to how Gen2 works there.ISSUESMost of the issues I've encountered have been more the fault of the house wiring or some other external factor rather than an issue with any of the switches themselves, but they're not without fault.-- Some LED bulbs just don't play nice with the dimmers.  Maybe this is my fault for trying the less expensive bulbs, but I've noticed the EcoSmart from Home Depot don't always dim very well.  Other brands work better, but I have yet to find an LED bulb/switch combo that gives 1) the dimming range or 2) dimming smoothness and 3) no flicker on dimmer settings than 100% of an incandescent bulb.  You can get one or two, but not all 3.-- I have had some disconnects.  I haven't had enough that I'd call it unusable or a deal breaker, but it happens. Most things with wifi will sometimes drop.  This is much easier to deal with on the dimmer switches since you can pull out the bottom dimmer rocker and it cuts power to the switch effectively letting you reset its connection.  I wish the plain switches had something similar where I could cut their power without having to flip a breaker.  Honestly, when a non-dimmer isn't connected I don't do anything.  It'll eventually reconnect but sometimes it's a day and sometimes it's a few days.  If there was an easily accessible reset button on the plain switch that would make things so much easier.--  I have had 1 switch (out of 26) just up and die on me... so far any way.  It was in my super crowded kitchen dual gang box which I think contributed to its death.  However, and this is a plus, Leviton support was great.  They walked me through some steps (which I had already tried, but I understand they need to check their boxes) and then they sent me a new switch.  It was all handled very well, no run around or anything.  Also, since it was a Gen1 switch that has been discontinued they replaced it with a Gen2 equivalent.Overall I am very pleased with the switches and how they operate day to day.  If the one hadn't died and they could address the resets on the plain switches I'd give them 5 stars all day.  I'm not sure who to blame for the dimming, if it's Leviton or LED bulbs in general so for the moment I won't hold that against them.  Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.###nearly<12:18>|house<38:43>|version<61:68>|control<87:94>|control<87:98>|nearly<99:105>|house<123:128>|start<133:140>|replace<141:150>|year<169:174>|few

So I started searching around for a new smart switch (Dimmer), and ran across the Kasa switches. I went ahead and purchased one to test it out.Installation: 5 stars, super easy and much better in my opinion than the WeMo switches.  Main wires screw onto to the switch plate, and a couple of wires run off to attach with nuts. WeMo had all wires run off to attach with wire nuts which resulted in large amounts of wire and clutter behind the switches making them much harder to work with.Application: 5 stars, switch was immediately recognized and I had no problems with the application. Unlike the WeMo switches where I had several that had significant problems connecting, and they constantly disconnect. The Kasa switch has had a couple of times where the physical switch didn't work for a short period of time, but the app has always worked even when the switch didn't, and then the following day the physical switch would again work. Not sure if that is the result of a bad switch or if something else is going on, but ultimately it is a relatively minor issue as I can always use the application to turn the lights on or off if needed.Wireless: again the setup and connection were easy, and I haven't had any problems with the switch staying connected to my network and always being accessible via the application. I have loads of problems with this on the WeMo switches.Design: The design is much more well thought out from the wiring to even the physical function of the Switch than the WeMo version. WeMo uses a capacitive touch plate that runs the entire length of the switch. This results in the dimmer level constantly being change, turned off, etc... whenever you turn the light switch on or off because almost the entire switch is capacitive touch. Kasa on the other hand has their dimmer buttons at the very top of the switch so they are never in the way but are very easy to access.Quality: Quality seems to be on par with the WeMo, but the design decisions were clearly well thought out. If feels like someone actually tested the Kasa Switch, while it feels like no one actually ever tested the WeMo switch design of they would have easily seen and addressed several of the blatant issues it has.Note: there is one oddity with the Kasa switch, you may consider it a good or bad thing, but when turning the switch on/off there is a slightly delay (maybe 1-2 seconds). It caught me off guard at first and made me think the switch wasn't working properly. I'm still on the fence on whether this is a good thing or not, I think I prefer the instant switching action, but I can see why some people might prefer the delay and once you realize it is there it is honestly not a major issue.The Kasa Dimmer switch isn't perfect, there are a few oddities to it, but it generally functions well, it seems to be far more well thought out than the WeMo switches and is significantly more reliable as a \"Smart\" switch. If you are trying to decide between Kasa and WeMo, don't wait, go with the Kasa switches, they are significantly better in almost every way than my WeMo Switches have been. At some point I will be replacing the rest of my switches with the Kasa Switches and removing WeMo entirely from my house as they just have way too many problems with them.###recently<56:64>|instal<65:74>|wemo<81:85>|test<106:110>|find<125:130>|design<149:155>|design<149:157>|par<171:174>|particularly<171:183>|happy<184:189>|start<206:213>|search<214:223>|new<237:240>|smart<241:246>|dimmer<255:261>|run<268:271>|kasa<283:287>|ahead<305:310>|one<325:328>|test<332:336>|installation<344:356>|5 star<358:365>|super<367:372>|easy<373:377>|opinion<400:407>|wemo<417:421>|main<433:437>|wire<438:442>|wire<438:443>|screw<444:449>|plate<469:474>|couple<482:488>|a couple<480:488>|wire<492:496>|wire<492:497>|run<498:501>|attach<509:515>|nut<521:525>|wemo<527:531>|wire<540:544>|wire<540:545>|run<546:549>|attach<557:563>|wire<569:573>|wire nut<569:578>|nut<574:578>|result<585:591>|result<585:593>|large<597:602>|amount<603:610>|wire<614:618>|hard<668:674>|application<688:699>|5 star<701:708>|immediately<721:732>|recognize<733:743>|no problem<754:765>|problem<757:765>|application<775:786>|wemo<799:803>|ever<826:830>|significant<842:853>|problem<854:862>|connect<863:873>|constantly<884:894>|disconnect<895:905>|kasa<911:915>|couple<933:939>|a couple<931:939>|couple of time<933:948>|physical<959:967>|physical switch<959:974>|short<993:998>|period<999:1005>|short period<993:1005>|period of time<999:1013>|always<1031:1037>|follow<1087:1096>|day<1097:1100>|physical<1105:1113>|physical switch<1105:1120>|again<1127:1132>|result<1163:1169>|ultimately<1224:1234>|relatively<1243:1253>|minor<1254:1259>|issue<1260:1265>|always<1275:1281>|application<1290:1301>|turn<1305:1309>|wireless<1341:1349>|again<1351:1356>|setup<1361:1366>|connection<1371:1381>|easy<1387:1391>|problem<1415:1423>|any problem<1411:1423>|stay<1440:1447>|connect<1448:1457>|network<1464:1471>|always<1476:1482>|access<1489:1495>|application<1508:1519>|load<1528:1533>|problem<1537:1545>|wemo<1563:1567>|design<1577:1583>|design<1589:1595>|wiring<1635:1641>|physical<1654:1662>|function<1663:1671>|wemo<1695:1699>|version<1700:1707>|wemo<1709:1713>|touch<1732:1737>|plate<1738:1743>|run<1749:1752>|run<1749:1753>|entire<1758:1764>|length<1765:1771>|result<1792:1798>|result<1792:1799>|dimmer<1807:1813>|level<1814:1819>|constantly<1820:1830>|change<1837:1843>|turn<1845:1849>|turn<1845:1851>|ever<1868:1872>|never<1867:1872>|turn<1877:1881>|almost<1917:1923>|entire<1928:1934>|touch<1956:1961>|kasa<1963:1967>|hand<1981:1985>|dimmer<1996:2002>|button<2003:2010>|top<2023:2026>|never<2053:2058>|ever<2054:2058>|easy<2083:2087>|access<2091:2097>|par<2130:2133>|wemo<2143:2147>|design<2157:2163>|decision<2164:2173>|clearly<2179:2186>|feel<2208:2213>|one<2223:2226>|actually<2227:2235>|test<2236:2240>|test<2236:2242>|kasa<2247:2251>|feel<2269:2274>|one<2283:2286>|actually<2287:2295>|ever<2296:2300>|test<2301:2305>|test<2301:2307>|wemo<2312:2316>|design<2324:2330>|easily<2350:2356>|address<2366:2375>|ever<2377:2381>|issue<2399:2404>|issue<2399:2405>|note<2413:2417>|one<2428:2431>|kasa<2448:2452>|consider<2469:2477>|turn<2511:2515>|turn<2511:2518>|slightly<2548:2556>|delay<2557:2562>|2 second<2572:2581>|second<2574:2581>|first<2610:2615>|properly<2660:2668>|still<2674:2679>|prefer<2743:2749>|instant<2754:2761>|action<2772:2778>|some people<2798:2809>|people<2803:2809>|prefer<2816:2822>|delay<2827:2832>|realize<2846:2853>|one<2873:2876>|honestly<2872:2880>|major<2887:2892>|issue<2893:2898>|kasa<2903:2907>|dimmer<2908:2914>|generally<2976:2985>|function<2986:2994>|function<2986:2995>|far<3017:3020>|wemo<3052:3056>|significant<3073:3084>|significantly<3073:3086>|reliable<3092:3100>|smart<3107:3112>|decide<3143:3149>|kasa<3158:3162>|wemo<3167:3171>|wait<3179:3183>|kasa<3197:3201>|significant<3221:3232>|significantly<3221:3234>|almost<3245:3251>|ever<3252:3256>|wemo<3270:3274>|switches<3275:3283>|point<3303:3308>|replace<3319:3328>|the rest<3329:3337>|rest<3333:3337>|kasa<3362:3366>|switches<3367:3375>|remove<3380:3388>|wemo<3389:3393>|entire<3394:3400>|entirely<3394:3402>|house<3411:3416>|any problem<3444:3456>|problem<3448:3456>",

Easy to install.</b> I decided to start a \"project\" to smarten up every light switch in our house.  I can't do it all at once, but I started with 3 pack of these dimmable light switches.  They worked great. Installation was easy, though I'm kind of wondering why they have 2 wires coming out of the back of the switch, but for the line and load you attach the wires directly to the side of the switch via screw terminals.  It worked fine, but they should just pick one or the other.Once installed make sure you pick the right product from the kasa app.  I was selecting the non-dimmable switch and kasa was not finding it.  Also I had to calibrate the dimming setting twice.  Not really a big deal, but I'm not sure why it doesn't work the first time.###easy<22:26>|install<30:37>|decide<45:52>|start<56:61>|project<65:72>|house<114:119>|once<143:147>|start<155:160>|start<155:162>|3 pack<168:174>|pack<170:174>|dimmable<184:192>|installation<229:241>|easy<246:250>|kind<263:267>|wonder<271:280>|wire<297:302>|back<321:325>|line<353:357>|load<362:366>|attach<371:377>|wire<382:387>|directly<388:396>|side<404:408>|screw<427:432>|screw terminal<427:442>|terminal<433:442>|pick<482:486>|once<504:508>|install<509:516>|instal<509:518>|pick<533:537>|kasa<565:569>|the kasa app<561:573>|kasa app<565:573>|select<582:591>|non<596:599>|dimmable<600:608>|kasa<620:624>|find<633:640>|calibrate<660:669>|dimming<674:681>|set<682:689>|twice<690:695>|big<711:714>|big deal<711:719>|deal<715:719>|a big deal<709:719>|first<762:767>|the first time<758:772>|first time<762:772>"

If you connect these to a switched outlet, beware!  You will need to mark the outlet and make sure everyone in the house knows not to plug anything but a light into the switch.  These things will burn out if you connect a vacuum or anything greater than 300 watts to it.Also, this is not a direct replacement to a single pole switch.  You'll have to power the unit (switch) so it needs a ground, a hot, a neutral and load (or red wire which goes to the fixture).These switches work with the Google home app but only the basics, like on, off and dimming capability but you don't have timer, presets, scheduling or any of the other niceties available with the switches (You can set up routines in the Google home app which will turn things on and off and dim, but these aren't the same).  You'll have to use the Kasa app for the extras and it works fine on iPhone.These switches don't work well with some dimmable light fixtures.  If you have the fixture and want to control it with these switches, I recommend you research if that fixture works well with Kasa type switches.  I've also found that Ecosmart bulbs which say they are dimmable eventually fail when connected to these switches.###control<61:68>|connect<95:102>|connect<95:104>|fixture<118:125>|light fixture<112:125>|worry<152:157>|connect<173:180>|outlet<201:207>|beware<209:215>|mark<235:239>|outlet<244:250>|house<281:286>|plug<300:304>|burn<362:366>|connect<378:385>|300 watt<420:429>|watt<424:429>|direct<456:462>|replacement<463:474>|single<480:486>|pole<487:491>|a single pole<478:491>|single pole<480:491>|single pole switch<480:498>|power<516:521>|unit<526:530>|ground<554:560>|hot<564:567>|neutral<571:578>|load<583:587>|red<592:595>|wire<596:600>|fixture<619:626>|google<657:663>|google home<657:668>|home<664:668>|the google home<653:668>|google home app<657:672>|basic<686:692>|dim<711:714>|dim<711:718>|capability<719:729>|timer<749:754>|set<759:762>|preset<756:763>|scheduling<765:775>|available<805:814>|set<842:845>|routine<849:857>|google<865:871>|the google home<861:876>|google home<865:876>|home<872:876>|google home app<865:880>|turn<892:896>|dim<919:922>|same<945:949>|kasa<976:980>|kasa app<976:984>|the kasa app<972:984>|extra<993:999>|iphone<1021:1027>|dim<1069:1072>|dimmable<1069:1077>|fixture<1084:1091>|light fixture<1078:1091>|light fixture<1078:1092>|fixture<1084:1092>|fixture<1111:1118>|control<1131:1138>|recommend<1165:1174>|research<1179:1187>|fixture<1196:1203>|kasa<1220:1224>|type<1225:1229>|find<1251:1256>|ecosmart<1262:1270>|bulb<1271:1276>|dim<1296:1299>|dimmable<1296:1304>|eventually<1305:1315>|fail<1316:1320>|connect<1326:1333>|connect<1326:1335>",

It’s well made and couldn’t have been easier to connect to the Kasa app and was up and running within minutes.  However, replacing a standard switch with a Smart switch requires a bit of electrical know how as a smart switch requires a neutral connection that won’t already be there.  This isn’t unique to this switch as all smart switches are standalone devices that require power to operate and not just a “break” in the circuit like a normal light switch.  That said, the neutral wire will be in the junction box you just need to look for it.  So, if you’re not experienced with home wiring I would seek out help from someone who is as the included instructions are minimal at best.  You can find DIY videos on YouTube that help but you never really know how qualified they are. In fact, one video I referenced gave wiring advice that wasn’t compatible with this switch.###perfectly<9:18>|installation<23:35>|require<36:43>|require<36:44>|electrical<50:60>|knowledge<61:70>|smart<92:97>|control<108:115>|outdoor<116:123>|spot<124:128>|easy<176:182>|connect<186:193>|kasa<201:205>|kasa app<201:209>|the kasa app<197:209>|run<225:232>|minute<240:247>|however<250:257>|replace<259:268>|standard<271:279>|smart<294:299>|require<307:314>|require<307:315>|electrical<325:335>|smart<350:355>|require<363:370>|require<363:371>|neutral<374:381>|connect<382:389>|connection<382:392>|already<404:411>|unique<434:440>|smart<463:468>|device<493:500>|require<506:513>|power<514:519>|operate<523:530>|break<547:552>|circuit<561:568>|normal<576:582>|a normal light<574:588>|normal light switch<576:595>|neutral<613:620>|wire<621:625>|neutral wire<613:625>|the neutral wire<609:625>|junction<641:649>|box<650:653>|junction box<641:653>|the junction box<637:653>|experience<703:714>|home<720:724>|wiring<725:731>|help<749:753>|include<781:789>|instruction<790:802>|minimal<807:814>|find<833:837>|video<842:847>|video<842:848>|youtube<852:859>|help<865:869>|never<878:883>|fact<923:927>|video<933:938>|give<952:956>|wiring<957:963>|advice<964:970>|compatible<983:993>",

This made the installation of a switch and dimmer today much longer to do. Last week, I had to do a 3-gang box (all 1st Gen switches) because one of them failed. Replacing it with a new 2nd Gen switch was a pain in-the-you-know-what. Had to redo the whole box because of the different wiring. If there were screw terminals, most of the time it's simply backing off the old switch/dimmer (dumb or smart) and \"dropping in\" the new (with the exception on the neutral wires).Though the 2nd Gen switches/dimmers are a bit shallower, having to now use wire nuts and addition of lead wires adds EXTRA stuff being pushed in the workbox. You are NOT saving on space. I ended up cutting back several lead wires to save on space.I haven't had enough time to comment about performance but I did notice that these connected to Wi-Fi extremely fast vs the 1st Gen switches/dimmers that I have - within seconds(!!) of the power being turned back on after installation.###bring<3:8>|back<9:13>|screw<18:23>|2nd<42:45>|2nd gen<42:49>|the 2nd gen<38:49>|gen<46:49>|2nd gen switch<42:56>|2nd gen switch<42:58>|dimmer<59:65>|dimmer<59:66>|now<67:70>|lead<78:82>|wire<83:87>|wire<83:88>|hang<89:96>|box<106:109>|instead<110:117>|screw<121:126>|screw terminal<121:136>|terminal<127:136>|installation<152:164>|dimmer<181:187>|today<188:193>|long<199:205>|last<213:217>|week<218:222>|3 gang<238:244>|gang<240:244>|3 gang box<238:248>|gang box<240:248>|box<245:248>|1st<254:257>|gen<258:261>|1st gen<254:261>|1st gen switch<254:270>|fail<292:298>|replace<300:309>|new<320:323>|2nd<324:327>|gen<328:331>|2nd gen<324:331>|2nd gen switch<324:338>|pain<345:349>|a pain<343:349>|now<362:365>|whole<388:393>|box<394:397>|different<413:422>|wiring<423:429>|screw<445:450>|terminal<451:460>|screw terminal<445:460>|most<462:466>|simply<484:490>|back<491:495>|back<491:498>|old<507:510>|dimmer<518:524>|dumb<526:530>|smart<534:539>|drop<546:554>|new<563:566>|exception<577:586>|neutral<594:601>|wire<602:606>|wire<602:607>|2nd<620:623>|the 2nd gen<616:627>|2nd gen<620:627>|gen<624:627>|2nd gen switch<620:634>|2nd gen switch<620:636>|dimmer<637:643>|dimmer<637:644>|now<676:679>|wire<684:688>|nut<689:693>|wire nut<684:693>|addition<698:706>|lead<710:714>|wire<715:719>|wire<715:720>|add<721:725>|extra<726:731>|push<744:750>|box<762:765>|save<779:785>|space<789:794>|end<798:803>|cut<807:814>|back<815:819>|lead<828:832>|wire<833:837>|wire<833:838>|save<842:846>|space<850:855>|comment<885:892>|performance<899:910>|notice<921:927>|connect<939:948>|wi<952:954>|fi<955:957>|wi fi<952:957>|extremely<958:967>|fast<968:972>|1st<980:983>|1st gen<980:987>|gen<984:987>|1st gen switch<980:996>|dimmer<997:1003>|dimmer<997:1004>|second<1026:1033>|power<1045:1050>|turn<1057:1063>|back<1064:1068>|installation<1078:1090>",

Screw terminals make it easier to install in a crowded box. To use with HomeSeer, install the free TPLinkSmartHome4 plugin. With this plugin you can control the device without the Kasa mobile app and it controls the device without going through the cloud.

This could have been dangerous since it led to power flowing through - lights stayed on whether the switch was on or off (via physical switch or app).  I was able to wiggle the built in neutral wire where it came out of the switch and the lights would turn on/off/flicker.  All the other wire connections were fine and making good contact.  Replaced the defective switch with another of this same model and it's working great, hoping it lasts longer than the first.TP-link chat support was TERRIBLE and didn't seem to understand the issue after half an hour of delayed responses.  They said they would get back to me, confirmed my email, but didn't provide a case number and have not gotten back to me.  Unfortunately I was just outside the Amazon return window.  I was also unable to register this switch serial number with their support site even though Amazon was the seller and another switch ordered the same day registered just fine.  I would recommend entering your serial number on the TP-link site before installing and while you can still return it to be safe.###last<17:23>|support<34:41>|appreciate<48:58>|calibration<63:74>|dim<79:86>|led<92:96>|kasa<105:109>|kasa app<105:113>|the kasa app<101:113>|unfortunately<133:146>|wire<160:164>|short<165:172>|wire<214:218>|wire<214:219>|build<224:229>|back<250:254>|design<283:289>|lead<332:335>|power<339:344>|stay<370:376>|physical<418:426>|physical switch<418:433>|able<450:454>|build<469:474>|neutral<478:485>|neutral wire<478:490>|wire<486:490>|turn<544:548>|flicker<556:563>|wire<580:584>|connection<585:596>|contact<623:630>|replace<633:641>|defective<646:655>|same<684:688>|model<689:694>|same model<684:694>|hope<719:725>|last<729:734>|long<735:741>|first<751:756>|tp<757:759>|link<760:764>|tp link<757:764>|chat<765:769>|support<770:777>|chat support<765:777>|understand<810:820>|issue<825:830>|an hour<842:849>|hour<845:849>|delay<853:860>|response<861:870>|back<898:902>|confirm<910:919>|email<923:928>|provide<941:948>|case<951:955>|number<956:962>|back<983:987>|unfortunately<996:1009>|return<1040:1046>|turn<1042:1046>|window<1047:1053>|able<1069:1073>|unable<1067:1073>|register<1077:1085>|serial<1098:1104>|serial number<1098:1111>|number<1105:1111>|support<1123:1130>|site<1131:1135>|same<1201:1205>|same day<1201:1209>|day<1206:1209>|register<1210:1218>|register<1210:1220>|recommend<1241:1250>|enter<1251:1259>|serial<1265:1271>|serial number<1265:1278>|number<1272:1278>|tp<1286:1288>|tp link<1286:1293>|link<1289:1293>|the tp link<1282:1293>|site<1294:1298>|instal<1306:1316>|still<1335:1340>|turn<1343:1347>|return<1341:1347>|safe<1357:1361>",

Wiring is basic and requires a neutral wire in the box. Hit some snags setting it up. First tried adding in HomeKit, it could see it, but failed to add. Next tried the MyLeviton app, that also failed. Reset dimmer to factory (depress top of switch for 15 seconds or so until LED flashes red/orange). Next tried the Decora Smart Home App (used for 1st Gen. switches), that did add the dimmer and then it was added to HomeKit. After getting it up and running, all works fine. The older 1st Gen. dimmers have been reliable but do sometimes require a restart (cut off power, turn back on, a small lever on the switch makes this easy, no trip to breaker box) to come back online after a power or WiFi outage. We’ll see if the 2nd Gen is less prone to becoming unresponsive occasionally.###home<11:15>|homekit<11:18>|a couple<33:41>|couple<35:41>|1st<42:45>|1st gen<42:49>|gen<46:49>|dimmer<50:56>|dimmer<50:57>|year<62:67>|recently<72:80>|add<81:84>|add<81:86>|2nd<92:95>|2nd gen<92:99>|gen<96:99>|wiring<101:107>|basic<111:116>|require<121:128>|require<121:129>|neutral<132:139>|a neutral wire<130:144>|neutral wire<132:144>|wire<140:144>|box<152:155>|hit<157:160>|set<172:179>|first<187:192>|add<199:202>|add<199:205>|home<209:213>|homekit<209:216>|fail<239:245>|add<249:252>|next<254:258>|myleviton<269:278>|myleviton app<269:282>|fail<294:300>|reset<302:307>|dimmer<308:314>|factory<318:325>|top<335:338>|second<356:363>|led<376:379>|flash<380:387>|red<388:391>|orange<392:398>|next<401:405>|decora<416:422>|smart<423:428>|decora smart<416:428>|home<429:433>|smart home<423:433>|1st<448:451>|gen<452:455>|1st gen<448:455>|add<477:480>|dimmer<485:491>|add<508:511>|add<508:513>|home<517:521>|homekit<517:524>|run<550:557>|old<579:584>|1st<585:588>|1st gen<585:592>|gen<589:592>|dimmer<594:600>|dimmer<594:601>|reliable<612:620>|sometimes<628:637>|require<638:645>|restart<648:655>|cut<657:660>|power<665:670>|turn<672:676>|back<677:681>|small<688:693>|lever<694:699>|easy<725:729>|trip<734:738>|breaker<742:749>|box<750:753>|back<763:767>|online<768:774>|power<783:788>|wifi<792:796>|outage<797:803>|2nd<822:825>|the 2nd gen<818:829>|2nd gen<822:829>|gen<826:829>|less<833:837>|become<847:855>|unresponsive<856:868>|occasionally<869:881>",
      "Requires neutral wire###require<0:8>|neutral<9:16>|wire<17:21>|neutral wire<9:21>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2023-08-17] <b>Check your wiring before ordering. Lots of great features in a smart switch</b> I've been using the Kasa line of smart switches for about a year now. I own the several of the three-way and single light switches. I use some of the automation in the Kasa app to set the lighting in my basement for watching movies. This allows me to turn off certain switches and dim others with a single button in the app. Very handy and impressive for guests. I also have rules configured that shut my lights off if they are left on after 1 am. It's pretty easy to do and this to me is where automation pays off. I plan to continue using this across the rest of my house as they go on sale. I've been very excited to see that kasa is supporting the matter protocol. This will make it much easier in the future to control my smart devices of any brand from a single app like Google Home. I've made sure all smart device purchases going forward support this.I ran into a few problems that should be addresses before ordering. The lighting in my basement was wired using 3 wire so there is no true neutral wire at some of my outlets. I think this was done to make the wiring cheaper when the house was built and the basement was left unfinished. Before you order, check to see that you have the traditional black/white/bare copper at your light switches. I did damage one of the previous generation switches by not wiring it correctly. Since then I created a small test lab so I can wire these switches up with a light bulb and test them before install. I recommend this step because you do not want to damage one of these switches after the return period is over. My experience with Kasa support was painful. They required me to pay for shipping in order to get a new switch. That pretty much meant I paid double for the switch when it was all said and done. Another issue you may run into is if you purchase the Tapo line of smart products also made by TP Link. They look identical but run on different software apps. This is where the support for Matter is so important. Without that, there is no way to program them to work together with the Kasa products.The only feature I am waiting for from the kasa line up is a motion sensor. This could be really handy for turning on lights when you enter a room or stairway. They currently only offer single pole switch with this function.###check<3:8>|wiring<14:20>|wire<14:20>|feature<52:59>|feature<52:60>|smart<66:71>|kasa<103:107>|line<108:112>|smart<116:121>|year<143:147>|now<148:151>|own<155:158>|three way<178:187>|single<192:198>|automation<233:243>|kasa<251:255>|kasa app<251:259>|the kasa app<247:259>|set<263:266>|lighting<271:279>|basement<286:294>|watch<299:307>|movie<308:314>|allow<321:327>|turn<334:338>|certain<343:350>|dim<364:367>|single<382:388>|button<389:395>|single button<382:395>|handy<413:418>|guest<438:444>|rule<458:463>|configure<464:474>|shut<480:484>|leave<511:515>|am<527:529>|pretty<536:542>|easy<543:547>|automation<578:588>|pay<589:592>|pay<589:593>|plan<601:605>|continue<609:617>|rest<640:644>|the rest<636:644>|house<651:656>|sale<671:675>|excited<692:699>|kasa<712:716>|support<720:727>|support<720:730>|matter<735:741>|protocol<742:750>|matter protocol<735:750>|easy<775:781>|future<789:795>|control<799:806>|smart<810:815>|device<816:822>|device<816:823>|run<832:835>|brand<831:836>|single<844:850>|google<860:866>|home<867:871>|google home<860:871>|smart<892:897>|device<898:904>|forward<921:928>|support<929:936>|run<944:947>|problem<959:967>|address<983:992>|lighting<1014:1022>|basement<1029:1037>|wire<1042:1046>|wire<1042:1047>|wire<1056:1060>|neutral<1081:1088>|neutral wire<1081:1093>|wire<1089:1093>|outlet<1108:1115>|wire<1151:1157>|wiring<1151:1157>|cheap<1158:1165>|house<1175:1180>|build<1185:1190>|basement<1199:1207>|leave<1212:1216>|check<1247:1252>|traditional<1278:1289>|black<1290:1295>|white<1296:1301>|copper<1307:1313>|am<1345:1347>|damage<1344:1350>|previous<1362:1370>|generation<1371:1381>|wiring<1398:1404>|wire<1398:1404>|correctly<1408:1417>|create<1432:1439>|small<1442:1447>|test<1448:1452>|wire<1466:1470>|bulb<1502:1506>|test<1511:1515>|install<1528:1535>|recommend<1539:1548>|step<1554:1558>|am<1587:1589>|damage<1586:1592>|turn<1627:1631>|return<1625:1631>|period<1632:1638>|return period<1625:1638>|experience<1651:1661>|kasa<1667:1671>|support<1672:1679>|painful<1684:1691>|require<1698:1706>|pay<1713:1716>|shipping<1721:1729>|new<1748:1751>|pretty<1765:1771>|mean<1777:1782>|pay<1785:1789>|double<1790:1796>|issue<1851:1856>|run<1865:1868>|tapo<1897:1901>|line<1902:1906>|smart<1910:1915>|tp<1938:1940>|link<1941:1945>|tp link<1938:1945>|identical<1957:1966>|run<1971:1974>|different<1978:1987>|software<1988:1996>|support<2021:2028>|matter<2033:2039>|important<2046:2055>|am<2095:2097>|program<2090:2097>|together<2111:2119>|kasa<2129:2133>|feature<2152:2159>|am<2162:2164>|wait<2165:2172>|kasa<2186:2190>|line<2191:2195>|motion<2204:2210>|motion sensor<2204:2217>|sensor<2211:2217>|handy<2240:2245>|turn<2250:2254>|turn<2250:2257>|enter<2277:2282>|room<2285:2289>|currently<2308:2317>|offer<2323:2328>|single<2329:2335>|single pole<2329:2340>|pole<2336:2340>|single pole switch<2329:2347>|function<2358:2366>",

They work super great and allow you to quickly and easily make changes without stripping or bending wire (and they work well with stranded wire)- These switches have fixed electrical jumpers instead of traditional clamp screws. This is an improvement in my book, esp. since the wire is stranded. if you use Wago nuts, they make installation all the way faster. stranded wire has the benefit of being way more flexible so you don't have to fight it as much in cramped boxes.- These switches require a neutral (white) wire to work.###device<27:34>|second<43:49>|second generation<43:60>|generation<50:60>|late<84:90>|version<91:98>|apple<102:107>|ios<108:111>|apple<116:121>|phone<122:128>|early<133:140>|model<141:146>|anymore<177:184>|new<190:195>|ios<196:199>|version<200:207>|version<200:208>|early<223:230>|15 amp<254:261>|amp<257:261>|apple<328:333>|apple homekit<328:341>|homekit<334:341>|scan<348:352>|homekit<357:364>|qr<365:367>|low<369:374>|remove<416:422>|plastic<427:434>|trim<435:439>|simply<454:460>|open<461:468>|iphone<474:480>|camera<481:487>|point<492:497>|qr<508:510>|homekit<511:518>|code<519:523>|new<537:542>|model<543:548>|slightly<558:566>|deep<567:573>|previous<583:591>|generation<592:602>|cause<619:624>|highly<643:649>|recommend<650:659>|lever<675:680>|nut<681:685>|wire<688:692>|nut<693:697>|wire nut<688:697>|exist<720:728>|wiring<729:735>|super<747:752>|allow<763:768>|quickly<776:783>|easily<788:794>|change<800:807>|strip<816:825>|wire<837:841>|strand<867:875>|wire<876:880>|fix<903:908>|electrical<909:919>|instead<928:935>|traditional<939:950>|screw<957:963>|improvement<976:987>|wire<1015:1019>|strand<1023:1031>|nut<1049:1053>|installation<1065:1077>|fast<1090:1096>|strand<1098:1106>|wire<1107:1111>|benefit<1120:1127>|flexible<1146:1154>|require<1227:1234>|neutral<1237:1244>|white<1246:1251>|white wire<1246:1257>|wire<1253:1257>",

I have 80-90% of my lighting automated now. I started out with a lot of Lutron's switches. They are very nice, but VERY expensive and they require a hub to work. I didn't try Kasa initially because the price was so low (especially when they put them on sale, which seems to happen frequently), that I thought they would be kind of junk.Turns out that is not the case at all. They have been great quality with a very nice app. In many respects they are better than the lutron switches. The design is nicer in my opinion, the single paddle is easier to use than the many little buttons on Lutron's. The paddle can be configured so that when you press and hold it, it turns the lights on to 100% or to a preset level, regardless of what the previous lighting level was (normally when you click it on it just goes to whatever level of lighting you left it at the last time).The reason I got it was that I replaced an overhead light fixture in my bathroom with a new LED one. It worked great with the standard, non-smart, dimmer I had. A little later I replaced it with a lutron dimmer and it would not dim to a low level without a TON of flickering. My wife really likes low light levels in there, so I decided to try the Kasa switch. It works perfect. Very, very low light level without any flicker.Just make sure you have a neutral wire in your box, it won't work without it. Usually the boxes do, but not all of them are wired that way. It's a big switch (as is the Lutron), so if the box is super tight, you might have to work a little to get the wires in there properly.###long<16:20>|neutral<35:42>|a neutral wire<33:47>|neutral wire<35:47>|wire<43:47>|all<59:62>|love<64:70>|kasa<71:75>|plug<91:96>|lighting<125:133>|automate<134:143>|now<144:147>|start<151:158>|lutron<177:183>|expensive<225:234>|require<244:251>|hub<254:257>|kasa<280:284>|all<290:293>|initially<285:294>|price<307:312>|low<320:323>|all<331:334>|especially<325:335>|put<346:349>|sale<358:362>|happen<379:385>|frequently<386:396>|kind<428:432>|junk<436:440>|turn<441:446>|case<467:471>|all<475:478>|lutron<573:579>|design<594:600>|opinion<616:623>|single<629:635>|paddle<636:642>|easy<646:652>|button<681:688>|lutron<692:698>|paddle<706:712>|configure<720:730>|press<748:753>|hold<758:762>|turn<770:775>|preset<806:812>|level<813:818>|regardless<820:830>|previous<843:851>|lighting<852:860>|level<861:866>|all<876:879>|normally<872:880>|click<890:895>|level<927:932>|lighting<936:944>|leave<949:953>|last<964:968>|reason<979:985>|replace<1006:1014>|overhead<1018:1026>|fixture<1033:1040>|light fixture<1027:1040>|bathroom<1047:1055>|new<1063:1066>|led<1067:1070>|standard<1101:1109>|non<1111:1114>|smart<1115:1120>|dim<1122:1125>|dimmer<1122:1128>|non smart dimmer<1111:1128>|smart dimmer<1115:1128>|later<1145:1150>|replace<1153:1161>|lutron<1172:1178>|dim<1179:1182>|lutron dimmer<1172:1185>|dimmer<1179:1185>|dim<1203:1206>|low<1212:1215>|level<1216:1221>|low level<1212:1221>|a ton<1230:1235>|ton<1232:1235>|flicker<1239:1246>|flickering<1239:1249>|wife<1254:1258>|all<1261:1264>|low<1272:1275>|level<1282:1287>|level<1282:1288>|decide<1304:1311>|kasa<1323:1327>|low<1365:1368>|level<1375:1380>|flicker<1393:1400>|neutral<1427:1434>|a neutral wire<1425:1439>|wire<1435:1439>|neutral wire<1427:1439>|box<1448:1451>|all<1482:1485>|usually<1479:1486>|box<1491:1494>|box<1491:1496>|all<1509:1512>|wire<1525:1529>|wire<1525:1530>|big<1548:1551>|lutron<1570:1576>|box<1589:1592>|super<1596:1601>|tight<1602:1607>|wire<1652:1656>|wire<1652:1657>|properly<1667:1675>",

After more than an hour I still have only two of three working on that app. It should be as simple as point phone at QR code, but that tells me to wait for an extended period of time then gives up.###frustrating<3:14>|frustration<42:53>|recommend<61:70>|first<71:76>|issue<90:95>|probably<105:113>|remove<125:131>|replace<149:156>|neutral<181:188>|most<193:197>|lucky<234:239>|neutral<244:251>|least<258:263>|box<271:274>|game<283:287>|point<336:341>|phone<347:352>|qr<360:362>|the qr code<356:367>|code<363:367>|qr code<360:367>|connect<371:378>|contact<399:406>|helpful<449:456>|least<501:506>|kasa<529:533>|kasa app<529:537>|the kasa app<525:537>|apple<576:581>|homekit<582:589>|apple homekit<576:589>|an hour<607:614>|hour<610:614>|still<617:622>|simple<683:689>|point<693:698>|phone<699:704>|qr<708:710>|qr code<708:715>|code<711:715>|wait<738:742>|period<759:765>|period of time<759:773>|give<779:784>",

      "Requires neutral wire###require<0:8>|neutral<9:16>|wire<17:21>|neutral wire<9:21>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2021-07-04] <b>Installation required Googling but I am still happy with it</b> We have quite quite a few Kasa SmartPlugs in our home so I thought I would give this a try since our dining room dimmer switch needed replacing.First, the \"Good\":- This is working very well on an antique oil chandelier that was converted to electric many years ago, and has an LED bulb.  If it is working well for that, I would imagine it will work well for just about any light.- It integrates  well with Alexa.  I am sitting in the family room right now and via voice turned it on, dimmed it, and then turned it off.  As will other Kasa smart devices, you can set a schedule and turn it on/off remotely.- It has a nice, oversized faceplate which I really like because it keeps the wall around the plate cleaner since there is less chance for hand contact.The \"Not Good\":- The faceplate is very difficult to remove when you pull the product from the box.  You fear you are going to break it.- It is even more difficult to remove if you have it mounted to the wall and need to make a \"depth\" adjustment to get a really good flush mount to the wall.- There is little to know guidance from Kasa in the box or on the web about how to remove the faceplate more easily.  Most of what I found was from their help forum from other buyers who had the same question.Advisements that don't affect my review but could help you:- My old dimmer switch had wire \"leads\" that made connecting the red and black wires.  This Kasa does not, which required me to flatten and straighten them so as not to loose any wire length.  That requires some tools a just a bit of manual dexterity.  The advantage of no lead wires is having less wiring and fewer wire caps to push back into the wall once you are done.- My old dimmer also had no ground wire.  If you are not used to replacing light switches and don't know, don't skip this step and call an electrician if you are unsure about good grounding.- Speaking of calling an electrician:  This Kasa requires an additional white (neutral) wire to work.  Do no assume that  because you have shut off power to your red/black wires that power it is also off to your white wire.  Again, call an electrician if you are not sure, or at the very least use a voltage tester.###installation<3:15>|require<16:24>|red<21:24>|still<43:48>|happy<49:54>|kasa<93:97>|home<116:120>|give<142:146>|dining<168:174>|dining room<168:179>|room<175:179>|dimmer<180:186>|replace<201:210>|first<211:216>|hand<276:280>|chandelier<275:285>|convert<295:304>|electric<308:316>|many year<317:327>|year<322:327>|ago<328:331>|led<344:347>|led bulb<344:352>|bulb<348:352>|imagine<395:402>|integrate<451:461>|alexa<473:478>|sit<486:493>|family<501:507>|family room<501:512>|room<508:512>|now<519:522>|voice<531:536>|turn<537:541>|turn<537:543>|dim<551:557>|turn<571:575>|turn<571:577>|kasa<601:605>|smart<606:611>|device<612:619>|kasa smart device<601:619>|set<629:632>|schedule<635:643>|turn<648:652>|oversized<689:698>|plate<703:708>|faceplate<699:708>|keep<740:745>|wall<750:754>|plate<766:771>|clean<772:779>|less<795:799>|chance<800:806>|hand<811:815>|contact<816:823>|faceplate<845:854>|plate<849:854>|difficult<863:872>|remove<876:882>|pull<892:896>|box<918:921>|break<950:955>|difficult<977:986>|remove<990:996>|mount<1012:1017>|mount<1012:1019>|wall<1027:1031>|depth<1052:1057>|adjustment<1059:1069>|flush<1091:1096>|mount<1097:1102>|flush mount<1091:1102>|wall<1110:1114>|now<1137:1140>|kasa<1155:1159>|box<1167:1170>|web<1181:1184>|remove<1198:1204>|faceplate<1209:1218>|plate<1213:1218>|easily<1224:1230>|most<1233:1237>|find<1248:1253>|help<1269:1273>|forum<1274:1279>|buyer<1291:1297>|same<1310:1314>|question<1315:1323>|affect<1347:1353>|help<1374:1378>|old<1388:1391>|dimmer<1392:1398>|old dimmer switch<1388:1405>|wire<1410:1414>|lead<1416:1420>|lead<1416:1421>|connect<1433:1443>|red<1448:1451>|black<1456:1461>|wire<1462:1466>|wire<1462:1467>|black wire<1456:1467>|kasa<1475:1479>|red<1501:1504>|require<1496:1504>|loose<1552:1557>|wire<1562:1566>|length<1567:1573>|require<1581:1589>|tool<1595:1600>|manual<1617:1623>|lead<1656:1660>|wire<1661:1665>|wire<1661:1666>|less<1677:1681>|wiring<1682:1688>|wire<1699:1703>|cap<1704:1708>|push<1712:1716>|back<1717:1721>|wall<1731:1735>|old<1759:1762>|dimmer<1763:1769>|ground<1782:1788>|wire<1789:1793>|ground wire<1782:1793>|replace<1819:1828>|now<1855:1858>|skip<1866:1870>|step<1876:1880>|call<1885:1889>|electric<1893:1901>|electrician<1893:1904>|an electrician<1890:1904>|ground<1934:1940>|call<1958:1962>|call<1958:1965>|electric<1969:1977>|an electrician<1966:1980>|electrician<1969:1980>|kasa<1988:1992>|require<1993:2001>|additional<2005:2015>|white<2016:2021>|neutral<2023:2030>|neutral wire<2023:2036>|wire<2032:2036>|assume<2053:2059>|shut<2083:2087>|power<2092:2097>|red<2106:2109>|black<2110:2115>|wire<2116:2120>|wire<2116:2121>|black wire<2110:2121>|power<2127:2132>|white<2156:2161>|wire<2162:2166>|white wire<2156:2166>|again<2169:2174>|call<2176:2180>|electric<2184:2192>|an electrician<2181:2195>|electrician<2184:2195>|least<2232:2237>|voltage<2244:2251>",

Even so the switch continues to work in the Leviton app. Most important you MUST have a neutral wire available in the switch box!  Many older homes may not run a neutral thru the switch location.

I can confirm that this is a Leviton issue and not my own WiFi issue because a subsequent installation of Kasa smart switches was fast and flawless, with super-strong WiFi connectivity. I can also confirm that Leviton's issues cannot be blamed on my eero mesh Wi-Fi system because I also tried connecting to a late-model Netgear router. Same abysmal connectivity again. It's a pity because the Leviton switch hardware is so much more robust than the Kasa, which has a flimsy, plasticky and toy-like feel. But solid Wi-Fi connectivity is non-negotiable for a smart switch, so don't gamble with this Leviton hardware. And one final nit with Leviton: the connecting wires are strand versus solid: very strange for a home electrical component (a cost-cutting measure?).

      "Stranded copper wires without pre-soldering###strand<0:8>|copper<9:15>|wire<16:21>|pre<30:33>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★☆☆ [2020-11-01] <b>Needs Some Work, Interferes w/Other Alexa Devices</b> My entire house is a smart home - all the lights are on Alexa, the garage doors are on Alexa, etc. Wanting to put voice control everywhere, I bought a Leviton Voice Dimmer to try it out, hoping to buy more of them if I liked it. Do I like it? Well, \"it's complicated\".Right off the bat, the install was fairly difficult. The voice dimmer is deeper than many wifi light switches, so gang box space becomes an issue. Along with this, the wires on the Leviton are stranded copper but with no pre-soldering that many wifi switches have, so wire nuts don't want to grip the wire. After fiddling with them for quite a while with no success, I grabbed my soldering iron and threw some solder on the wire tips - THIS MAKES AN IMMENSE DIFFERENCE IN THE INSTALL IF YOU ARE USING WIRE NUTS!Once installed, the issues began. The Leviton didn't want to stay connected to my wifi, half the time responding to my Alexa commands with \"I'm having trouble connecting to the internet\". A firmware update from my phone (which took several tries) did seem to fix this for the most part, but it does still do this every now and then.Another major issue: This interferes with other Alexa voice devices. My Echos are beyond earshot of the Leviton, but my ecobee5 thermostat (that has Alexa voice control built in) is within range, and this is a nightmare. They won't coordinate with each other, so if I say an Alexa command, they both try listen and respond. So far, no amount of fiddling with the Alexa app, Leviton app, or Ecobee app can get these to not interfere with each other - they both hear the command and try to respond. I resorted to muting the mic on my thermostat so that only the Leviton listened, but this is a shame as the thermostat is a better device with a better speaker.A few more minor annoyances: The speaker in the Leviton is OK but not amazing. Playing music through it sounds lackluster, but I won't ding the voice dimmer too much for this as playing music on the dimmer isn't its primary purpose. Another annoyance is that the Leviton will occasionally respond to itself - if the response it's giving has the word \"Alexa\" in it, it'll sometimes trigger itself and interrupt its own response, thinking someone has said the word \"Alexa\".If Leviton keeps working on this and works out the bugs by issuing new firmware, I can imagine this becoming a great device. But for now, the Leviton Voice Dimmer just seems like a work in progress. It's not quite there yet, and this makes for a frustrating experience. I do hope it gets better, though, as I'd love to have something like this all throughout my house, but it's just not there yet.###alexa<39:44>|entire<60:66>|entire house<60:72>|house<67:72>|smart<78:83>|smart home<78:88>|home<84:88>|a smart home<76:88>|alexa<113:118>|garage<124:130>|door<131:136>|alexa<144:149>|put<167:170>|voice<171:176>|voice control<171:184>|control<177:184>|everywhere<185:195>|leviton<208:215>|voice<216:221>|dimmer<222:228>|hope<244:250>|install<348:355>|fairly<360:366>|difficult<367:376>|voice<382:387>|dimmer<388:394>|deep<398:404>|wifi<415:419>|gang<439:443>|box<444:447>|gang box<439:447>|space<448:453>|become<454:461>|an issue<462:470>|issue<465:470>|wire<493:497>|wire<493:498>|leviton<506:513>|strand<518:526>|copper<527:533>|pre<546:549>|wifi<570:574>|wire<593:597>|wire nut<593:602>|nut<598:602>|wire<626:630>|while<669:674>|success<683:690>|grab<694:701>|throw<724:729>|wire<749:753>|tip<754:758>|difference<783:793>|install<801:808>|wire<826:830>|install<841:848>|instal<841:850>|issue<856:861>|issue<856:862>|begin<863:868>|leviton<874:881>|stay<897:901>|connected<902:911>|wifi<918:922>|respond<938:945>|de<944:948>|respond<938:948>|alexa<955:960>|command<961:968>|alexa command<955:968>|alexa command<955:969>|command<961:969>|trouble<987:994>|connect<995:1005>|internet<1013:1021>|firmware<1026:1034>|firmware update<1026:1041>|update<1035:1041>|a firmware update<1024:1041>|phone<1050:1055>|fix<1095:1098>|most<1112:1116>|part<1117:1121>|still<1135:1140>|now<1155:1158>|major<1176:1181>|issue<1182:1187>|interfere<1194:1203>|interfere<1194:1204>|alexa<1216:1221>|voice<1222:1227>|device<1228:1234>|device<1228:1235>|leviton<1272:1279>|most<1300:1304>|alexa<1317:1322>|voice<1323:1328>|control<1329:1336>|voice control<1323:1336>|build<1337:1342>|range<1357:1362>|nightmare<1378:1387>|alexa<1443:1448>|alexa command<1443:1456>|command<1449:1456>|listen<1472:1478>|respond<1483:1490>|far<1495:1498>|amount<1503:1509>|alexa<1531:1536>|leviton<1542:1549>|leviton app<1542:1553>|interfere<1590:1599>|hear<1628:1632>|command<1637:1644>|respond<1656:1663>|most<1704:1708>|leviton<1728:1735>|listen<1736:1742>|listen<1736:1744>|shame<1760:1765>|a shame<1758:1765>|most<1777:1781>|device<1796:1802>|speaker<1817:1824>|minor<1836:1841>|annoyance<1842:1851>|annoyance<1842:1852>|speaker<1858:1865>|leviton<1873:1880>|play<1904:1911>|music<1912:1917>|sound<1929:1935>|de<1960:1964>|voice<1969:1974>|dimmer<1975:1981>|play<2003:2010>|music<2011:2016>|dimmer<2024:2030>|primary<2041:2048>|purpose<2049:2056>|annoyance<2066:2075>|leviton<2088:2095>|occasionally<2101:2113>|respond<2114:2121>|response<2141:2149>|word<2170:2174>|alexa<2176:2181>|sometimes<2196:2205>|trigger<2206:2213>|own<2239:2242>|response<2243:2251>|word<2283:2287>|alexa<2289:2294>|leviton<2299:2306>|keep<2307:2312>|bug<2347:2351>|issue<2355:2362>|new<2363:2366>|firmware<2367:2375>|imagine<2383:2390>|become<2396:2404>|device<2413:2419>|now<2429:2432>|leviton<2438:2445>|voice<2446:2451>|dimmer<2452:2458>|yet<2516:2519>|frustrating<2542:2553>|experience<2554:2564>|hope<2571:2575>|though<2592:2598>|love<2607:2611>|house<2658:2663>|yet<2689:2692>",

It will not fit in a metal switch box (older houses). Yes you need a neutral and a ground into and out of that box.  IF you have a metal box, you have to build an extension with a plastic box and have it stick out from the wall. Except that.Also there is no overload protection in this device. If you have a short to the lamp, it will become useless. The dimmer's internal's fuse will pop and not the home circuit breaker. If you can get it repaired by the manufacturer, it will cost more than you can buy new. If you need to do any work on the dimmer/lamp/wiring turn off the breaker to the dimmer first. Then be sure there are no shorts in the circuit when you power it back on.There are dimmers like this style that have overload protection.I never had it installed and working, so I don't know how it works with Alexa or other apps.

I love the % presets that you can set in iPhone widgets. There are 4 preset settings and I have mine set at 35% -50-75-100. The convenience is the best, you don't have to stand there and adjust the light every time. It eliminates the guess work when you're setting your dimmer to different levels. I've probably owned about 10 items from this company and they have yet to disappoint. The flicker is the only reason I took off one star. I would have liked to have one setting at 25 or 30%, but that flicker is not cool. The bulb I am using is a Feit Electric LED, but I have tried incandescent bulbs too and the flicker persists. I'm LED bulbs all the way, but was curious if stone-age bulbs would work better.Wiring this up is cake for anyone who has wired up outlets in their homes, the only caveat is that it requires a neutral wire.Their iPhone interface and widgets are buggy at times, but just log into your Kasa account for it revert back to normal. I also have their smart outlets (5 stars), their smart light switches (5 stars) and their Deco wifi 6 mesh network (6 stars? -kidding 5+ stars). I have tried other brands, but this is the system I will keep going forward.###kasa<6:10>|trust<14:19>|dimmer<31:37>|slightly<45:53>|flicker<54:61>|flicker<54:62>|love<114:118>|set<128:131>|preset<125:131>|preset<125:132>|set<146:149>|iphone<153:159>|widget<160:167>|set<184:187>|preset<181:187>|set<188:191>|set<188:195>|setting<188:196>|set<213:216>|convenience<240:251>|stand<283:288>|adjust<299:305>|every time<316:326>|eliminate<331:341>|guess<346:351>|set<369:372>|set<369:376>|dimmer<382:388>|different<392:401>|level<402:408>|probably<415:423>|own<424:429>|company<455:462>|yet<477:480>|disappoint<484:494>|flicker<500:507>|the only reason<511:526>|reason<520:526>|only reason<515:526>|one star<538:546>|set<579:582>|set<579:586>|flicker<610:617>|cool<625:629>|bulb<635:639>|feit<656:660>|electric<661:669>|led<670:673>|lead<670:673>|incandescent<692:704>|bulb<705:709>|incandescent bulb<692:710>|bulb<705:710>|flicker<723:730>|lead<745:748>|led<745:748>|bulb<749:753>|bulb<749:754>|bulb<797:801>|bulb<797:802>|wire<821:827>|wire<863:867>|wire<863:868>|outlet<872:879>|home<889:894>|require<923:931>|neutral<934:941>|a neutral wire<932:946>|neutral wire<934:946>|wire<942:946>|iphone<953:959>|interface<960:969>|widget<974:981>|buggy<986:991>|log<1011:1014>|kasa<1025:1029>|kasa account<1025:1037>|account<1030:1037>|back<1052:1056>|normal<1060:1066>|smart<1086:1091>|outlet<1092:1099>|5 star<1101:1108>|smart<1117:1122>|5 star<1139:1146>|deco<1158:1162>|wifi<1163:1167>|mesh<1170:1174>|network<1175:1182>|mesh network<1170:1182>|5 star<1202:1210>|brand<1232:1238>|other brand<1226:1238>|system<1256:1262>|keep<1270:1274>|forward<1281:1288>",

Secondly, there is a riser under the screws that the wires need to go UNDER for the switch to work properly. Knowing this beforehand would have saved me some time and trouble, but after a few tries I got things working.Thankfully, setup with the app was very simple. I do wish there was a way to customize the dimming as my light doesn't turn on until the dimmer is set to about 65%. The app seems to allow this, but it never works for me.

Make sure your light switch you are trying to replace has a NEUTRAL wire, without this Alexa will NOT WORK.2.  Wiring this smart switch was easy considering I am not an electrician.  My advice:  a.  Watch youtube videos to get familiar with wiring and the significance of what a ground, LIVE, LOAD, Transfer and a Neutral wire is and its significance.  b.  check the light switch and make sure all required wires are in place, otherwise, it will be a long night  c.  Test the wifi, by downloading a SPEEDTEST App on your mobile device in the area you wish to install the smart switch.  By doing this will give you a good idea of how much internet bandwidth you are getting in that area to ensure it works properly.3.  Make sure your internet bandwidth is at least 50+mbps to ensure that you will always have a solid connection to the internet and Alexa will be happy.  (if you have DSL, change it to cable or fiber optic)4.  Be sure to have someone who is familar /computer savvy with downloading the Leviton App and syncing it to work with the Alexa App as well.5.  Once everything is synced up and all the above is complete you will not have any issues going forward.Since my install of this smart light switch I have been very happy and yet to have encountered any problems.  The only negative I have on the unit is that there is no way to pair it up to a Bluetooth device to help compensate with the small speaker that it comes in.  The sound is great but could use a little bit more punch.  I will definitely buy a few more.###alexa<11:16>|add<17:20>|faint<49:54>|straight<68:76>|point<84:89>|consider<119:127>|device<149:155>|place<208:213>|replace<206:213>|neutral<220:227>|neutral wire<220:232>|a neutral wire<218:232>|wire<228:232>|alexa<247:252>|wire<271:277>|smart<283:288>|easy<300:304>|consider<305:313>|consider<305:316>|an electrician<326:340>|electrician<329:340>|advice<346:352>|watch<359:364>|youtube<365:372>|youtube video<365:379>|video<373:379>|familiar<387:395>|wiring<401:407>|ground<439:445>|live<447:451>|load<453:457>|neutral<474:481>|a neutral wire<472:486>|wire<482:486>|neutral wire<474:486>|check<517:522>|require<558:566>|wire<567:571>|wire<567:572>|place<580:585>|otherwise<587:596>|long<611:615>|night<616:621>|test<627:631>|wifi<636:640>|download<645:656>|mobile<681:687>|device<688:694>|area<702:706>|wish<711:715>|install<719:726>|smart<731:736>|give<765:769>|idea<781:785>|internet<798:806>|bandwidth<807:816>|area<841:845>|ensure<849:855>|internet<893:901>|bandwidth<902:911>|least<918:923>|ensure<935:941>|always<956:962>|solid<970:975>|connection<976:986>|internet<994:1002>|alexa<1007:1012>|happy<1021:1026>|change<1047:1053>|cable<1060:1065>|fiber<1069:1074>|savvy<1134:1139>|download<1145:1156>|leviton<1161:1168>|leviton app<1161:1172>|the leviton app<1157:1172>|sync<1177:1184>|alexa<1205:1210>|sync<1246:1252>|complete<1277:1285>|issue<1308:1314>|any issue<1304:1314>|forward<1321:1328>|install<1338:1345>|smart<1354:1359>|happy<1390:1395>|yet<1400:1403>|encounter<1412:1423>|any problem<1424:1436>|problem<1428:1436>|negative<1448:1456>|unit<1471:1475>|pair<1503:1507>|bluetooth<1519:1528>|device<1529:1535>|help<1539:1543>|small<1564:1569>|small speaker<1564:1577>|speaker<1570:1577>|sound<1601:1606>|definitely<1663:1673>",
      "Requires neutral and ground connection###require<0:8>|neutral<9:16>|ground<21:27>|connection<28:38>|||B079775ZZQ ★★☆☆☆ [2023-01-14] <b>Not the best design and no web interface. Requires app for install and updates.</b> These are smart / WiFi dimmers that are hard-wired into a junction box for switched lights.Only supports 2.4 Ghz WifI band -- some of the hardware variants used in individual dimmers will stay connected indefinitely and some will disconnect and reconnect randomly and as frequently every few minutes.  It apparently has to do with the WiFi chips, firmware, or both.Sometimes the brightness level LEDs on the top if the dimmer will get stuck and stay on and at other times, they turn off after a few seconds.Alexa integration is OK for basic functions, but gets complicated rapidly as the number of named devices increases. You will need to come up with creative names if, for example, you have more than one dimmer per named room and then you will have to remember which are which. There is no alexa integration for calibration. firmware updates, or time or time zone adjustments.These dimmers work for most light sources:  incandescent (but wattage is limited to 200) and some dimmable fluorescent and some LED bulbs.Requires an app for initial installation, dimmer calibration, and for firmware or time updates.There is no easy reference source on the product page for bulb compatibility, so be sure you test your bulbs before going to the trouble to install these dimmers.Worked poorly on Feit LED candelabra bulbs: there was noticeable bulb flickering at dimming levels below 60 percent.Single pole (one switch) only.  Requires a neutral and ground connection, so there will be four wire connections per dimmer (green, white, and two for the controlled device).  Oddly, the green and white connections require wire nuts but the line and load are screwed into the side of the dimmer.Large back cover uses a lot of space in the junction box, so not the best choice for small or crowded junction boxes.The front up and down controls are too small and should be bigger.The indicator LED bulb is very dim and cannot be seen in a bright room.  A dimmable indicator on a dimmer would have been be a logical design choice, but it's not available on this model.There still is no web interface for these smart dimmers -- only app controls.  The Apple app does not support accessibility options and is not suitable for those with vision issues -- moreover, the contrast and size on the app screens is very poor even for those with good vision -- especially if your Apple device uses adaptive backlighting.There is a removable, screwless faceplate which is a nice feature. The face plate and switch front are a high gloss finish that shows fingerprints and scratches; a matte finish would be much better.There are two very small, unmarked and hard-to-access switches built into the dimmer bottom.  One reboots the dimmer without removing the programming and account information. The other wipes the device and removes it from an account.For those who prefer a flawless installation, be sure that the dimmer is not angled when you screw it into the junction box.  If there is any angle, the face plate will not fit flush with the dimmer. This is especially important if there are more than one switch or dimmer in a junction box.###design<16:22>|web<30:33>|interface<34:43>|face<39:43>|require<45:53>|install<62:69>|update<74:81>|smart<97:102>|wifi<105:109>|dim<110:113>|dimmer<110:116>|dimmer<110:117>|hard<127:131>|wire<132:136>|wire<132:137>|junction<145:153>|box<154:157>|junction

      "Flying leads installation###lead<7:12>|installation<13:25>|||B08RSM1KYN ★☆☆☆☆ [2021-12-17] <b>Disappointed with the switches (1st Gen)</b> I have been buying and installing WiFi enabled switches, plugs, and dimmers, both brand names and non-brand, in my house since late 2017. I have around 15 or so Leviton switches and dimmers plus around 30 from other brands. Over the past 4 years, the only failures I have experienced have been two Leviton 1st generator Wi-Fi switches. First switch got stuck in an off position in early November 2021. Second one failed in an on position yesterday, 12/16/2021. Both switches still connect to WiFi and respond to commands from the app and from pressing the rocker, but do not actually engage/disengage the switched contact, as if it was stuck in a failed last position. It seems to be a fairly high failure rate especially compared to other products I am using. I would recommend trying alternatives and not Leviton. I will try to get the failed switches replaced under warranty and update this post with my experience. Hopefully the 2nd generation switches have a better reliability record. Although I’m not a big fan of the flying leads installation.

      "Additional lead wires###additional<0:10>|lead<11:15>|wire<16:21>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★☆☆ [2021-04-27] <b>Bring Back The Screw Terminals</b> The 2nd Gen switches/dimmers now have 5 lead wires hanging from the box instead of screw terminals. This made the installation of a switch and dimmer today much longer to do. Last week, I had to do a 3-gang box (all 1st Gen switches) because one of them failed. Replacing it with a new 2nd Gen switch was a pain in-the-you-know-what. Had to redo the whole box because of the different wiring. If there were screw terminals, most of the time it's simply backing off the old switch/dimmer (dumb or smart) and \"dropping in\" the new (with the exception on the neutral wires).Though the 2nd Gen switches/dimmers are a bit shallower, having to now use wire nuts and addition of lead wires adds EXTRA stuff being pushed in the workbox. You are NOT saving on space. I ended up cutting back several lead wires to save on space.I haven't had enough time to comment about performance but I did notice that these connected to Wi-Fi extremely fast vs the 1st Gen switches/dimmers that I have - within seconds(!!) of the power being turned back on after installation.###bring<3:8>|back<9:13>|screw<18:23>|2nd<42:45>|2nd gen<42:49>|the 2nd gen<38:49>|gen<46:49>|2nd gen switch<42:56>|2nd gen switch<42:58>|dimmer<59:65>|dimmer<59:66>|now<67:70>|lead<78:82>|wire<83:87>|wire<83:88>|hang<89:96>|box<106:109>|instead<110:117>|screw<121:126>|screw terminal<121:136>|terminal<127:136>|installation<152:164>|dimmer<181:187>|today<188:193>|long<199:205>|last<213:217>|week<218:222>|3 gang<238:244>|gang<240:244>|3 gang box<238:248>|gang box<240:248>|box<245:248>|1st<254:257>|gen<258:261>|1st gen<254:261>|1st gen switch<254:270>|fail<292:298>|replace<300:309>|new<320:323>|2nd<324:327>|gen<328:331>|2nd gen<324:331>|2nd gen switch<324:338>|pain<345:349>|a pain<343:349>|now<362:365>|whole<388:393>|box<394:397>|different<413:422>|wiring<423:429>|screw<445:450>|terminal<451:460>|screw terminal<445:460>|most<462:466>|simply<484:490>|back<491:495>|back<491:498>|old<507:510>|dimmer<518:524>|dumb<526:530>|smart<534:539>|drop<546:554>|new<563:566>|exception<577:586>|neutral<594:601>|wire<602:606>|wire<602:607>|2nd<620:623>|the 2nd gen<616:627>|2nd gen<620:627>|gen<624:627>|2nd gen switch<620:634>|2nd gen switch<620:636>|dimmer<637:643>|dimmer<637:644>|now<676:679>|wire<684:688>|nut<689:693>|wire nut<684:693>|addition<698:706>|lead<710:714>|wire<715:719>|wire<715:720>|add<721:725>|extra<726:731>|push<744:750>|box<762:765>|save<779:785>|space<789:794>|end<798:803>|cut<807:814>|back<815:819>|lead<828:832>|wire<833:837>|wire<833:838>|save<842:846>|space<850:855>|comment<885:892>|performance<899:910>|notice<921:927>|connect<939:948>|wi<952:954>|fi<955:957>|wi fi<952:957>|extremely<958:967>|fast<968:972>|1st<980:983>|1st gen<980:987>|gen<984:987>|1st gen switch<980:996>|dimmer<997:1003>|dimmer<997:1004>|second<1026:1033>|power<1045:1050>|turn<1057:1063>|back<1064:1068>|installation<1078:1090>",
      "Gen2 switches use leads instead of screws###lead<18:23>|instead<24:31>|screw<35:41>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★★☆ [2021-07-09] <b>Used for nearly every switch in my house.</b> I have some version of these switches controlling nearly everything in my house.  I started replacing my switches a few years ago with the Gen1 switches and just recently finished out with the Gen2.  The only switches that aren't these are my bathroom exhaust fans.  I've written quite a lot here so congrats if you make it through to the end.The switches I have in use now are:DW6HD (Gen1 600W Dimmer)DW1KD (1000W Dimmer, Gen1 but still uses leads instead of screws)DW15S (Gen1 Switch)DW4SF (Gen1 4 Speed Fan Controller, also uses leads over screws)D26HD (Gen2 600W Dimmer)D215S (Gen2 Switch)DAWDC (Gen2 wireless dimmer companion)DAWSC (Gen2 wireless switch companion)Overall I am very happy with my switches.  I have not had issues with constant dropping as some have said here.  The app works well and I really like the Away feature in it though the same can be accomplished through Alexa.  Integration with Alexa works fine.  Alexa usually picks up a new switch and let's me know it's connected before I can finish entering the name I want for the device.  That's not an issue as it updates automatically once I enter the name I like.  They also integrate well with Samsung SmartThings.  I use that as I was accidentally sent some ZWave Leviton switches when I ordered WiFi ones so I put them to use rather than throwing them away as Amazon suggested.  I also really like that for anyone visiting they work just as you'd expect a normal switch to vs using something like smart bulbs where if the power gets cut things can go a bit funny.  My OCD also likes that these don't stick out/lean one way or the other when switched on/off.  They're very unassuming looking which to me is good.My house is only a few years old, none of the switch boxes are metal and just about everywhere has a neutral wire already in the box.  The only places I had issues were in some of the 3-way switches where whoever wired the house seemed to cut some corners and didn't run all the wiring these require, along with not keeping things in their standard place (e.g. red wire hot, black wire traveler, etc.)  so for a while some of my 3-way switches weren't 3-way.  The Gen2 wireless switch companions remedied this though.Like many others, in general I prefer the screw terminals.  However, there were a couple of instances where having the leads was handy.  For the neutral wire I did like using the lead as it is more flexible than cutting a piece of 14/2 and using that.  In my kitchen dual gang box, which was very crowded even before I changed the switches, it did actually save me some space as I could get rid of the extra rigid wiring and use the existing wire nut already in the box on the house neutrals so I wasn't adding anything.  The other instance I preferred the leads was in a bedroom.  Whoever wired the boxes liked to strip a portion of the hot wire, loop that around the hot terminal on the switch and then terminate the hot wire on the second switch in the box rather than using a wire nut with two leads coming off of it.  Both switches were connected on a continuous hot wire.  I was able to cut the wire down to the stripped part and then just nut both switch hot/black wires to the house hot wire.  The looping method they used is a pain with the screw terminals on the Gen1, but I've made it work before.  The leads made that easier however, overall I would prefer the screw terminals.The wireless switch/dimmer companions are awesome.  They solved my 3-way wiring issue and are super easy to setup.  I was afraid there may be some delay after pushing the rocker, but it's an instant response.  If you're using Gen2 switches and wish you had a 3-way light somewhere you don't these make a really easy fix for that especially since you can stick them to a bare wall with the included adhesive pads.  Hopefully the battery life lives up to the stated 5 years, but I won't hold my breath.I also really like the fan controllers.  I have pull chain ceiling fans without remotes in all bedrooms and the living room and these make it really to control the fan speed either with the switch itself, voice, or an app.  Much better than my short wife trying to stand on something to pull the chain.Gen1 vs Gen2As stated above, overall I like the screw terminals better than the leads on the Gen 2.Updating the switch firmware is easier on Gen2.  In the My Leviton app you can choose to Update All Gen2 switches at once.  For Gen1 switches you have to do them individually still.  Gets old fast when you have a lot of them.  The addition of the wireless switch companions for Gen2 is great.  I don't use Apple Homekit so I can't speak to how Gen2 works there.ISSUESMost of the issues I've encountered have been more the fault of the house wiring or some other external factor rather than an issue with any of the switches themselves, but they're not without fault.-- Some LED bulbs just don't play nice with the dimmers.  Maybe this is my fault for trying the less expensive bulbs, but I've noticed the EcoSmart from Home Depot don't always dim very well.  Other brands work better, but I have yet to find an LED bulb/switch combo that gives 1) the dimming range or 2) dimming smoothness and 3) no flicker on dimmer settings than 100% of an incandescent bulb.  You can get one or two, but not all 3.-- I have had some disconnects.  I haven't had enough that I'd call it unusable or a deal breaker, but it happens. Most things with wifi will sometimes drop.  This is much easier to deal with on the dimmer switches since you can pull out the bottom dimmer rocker and it cuts power to the switch effectively letting you reset its connection.  I wish the plain switches had something similar where I could cut their power without having to flip a breaker.  Honestly, when a non-dimmer isn't connected I don't do anything.  It'll eventually reconnect but sometimes it's a day and sometimes it's a few days.  If there was an easily accessible reset button on the plain switch that would make things so much easier.--  I have had 1 switch (out of 26) just up and die on me... so far any way.  It was in my super crowded kitchen dual gang box which I think contributed to its death.  However, and this is a plus, Leviton support was great.  They walked me through some steps (which I had already tried, but I understand they need to check their boxes) and then they sent me a new switch.  It was all handled very well, no run around or anything.  Also, since it was a Gen1 switch that has been discontinued they replaced it with a Gen2 equivalent.Overall I am very pleased with the switches and how they operate day to day.  If the one hadn't died and they could address the resets on the plain switches I'd give them 5 stars all day.  I'm not sure who to blame for the dimming, if it's Leviton or LED bulbs in general so for the moment I won't hold that against them.  Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.###nearly<12:18>|house<38:43>|version<61:68>|control<87:94>|control<87:98>|nearly<99:105>|house<123:128>|start<133:140>|replace<141:150>|year<169:174>|few

This was my second installation of this switch, but the first 3-way circuit.  You need to identify the hot wire in your box, and you need a neutral wire.  If you're comfortable with wiring, the installation is pretty straight forward (but a tight fit.) If you're creating a 3-way circuit, you must also wire a smart companion switch into the other box.  The wiring of the companion switch is very different from a mechanical switch, so read the wiring diagram carefully.  You need to be able to identify the red vs. red/yellow companion wires in the other box in order to wire the companion switch correctly.  Sort all the wiring out in both boxes before replacing the switches.  Once the switch is installed and powered up, you need to pair the switch to the \"My Leviton\" app.  Pairing is straight-forward, and there are lots of neat features you can use from the app when the switch is connected.  Siri/ Homekit integration is less easy.  The switch will not pair with Apple Home when first energized.  You need to download firmware updates first. Go to System Settings on the Leviton app and follow the update prompts.  It takes about 20 minutes to download the firmware updates.  Once installed, you will get a notice about updating to the Matter protocol. Say yes, and accept the update.  You then need to find the \"Matter Pairing Code\", which is under Device Settings for the switch.  Open the Home app on your phone and use the pairing code or QR-code to add the device to Apple Home.  This is NOT the same QR code that comes with the packaging. You can use Siri to control the switch once it has been added to Home.###apple<14:19>|home<20:24>|apple home<14:24>|siri<26:30>|instal<48:57>|smart<63:68>|replace<79:86>|mechanical<89:99>|3 way<100:105>|3 way switch<100:112>|second<127:133>|installation<134:146>|first<171:176>|3 way<177:182>|circuit<183:190>|identify<205:213>|hot<218:221>|hot wire<218:226>|wire<222:226>|box<235:238>|neutral<255:262>|neutral wire<255:267>|wire<263:267>|a neutral wire<253:267>|comfortable<280:291>|able<287:291>|wiring<297:303>|installation<309:321>|pretty<325:331>|straight<332:340>|forward<341:348>|tight<356:361>|tight fit<356:365>|a tight fit<354:365>|fit<362:365>|create<378:386>|3 way<389:394>|circuit<395:402>|wire<418:422>|smart<425:430>|companion<431:440>|box<463:466>|wiring<473:479>|companion<487:496>|different<512:521>|mechanical<529:539>|read<551:555>|wiring<560:566>|diagram<567:574>|carefully<575:584>|able<602:606>|identify<610:618>|red<623:626>|red<631:634>|companion<642:651>|wire<652:656>|wire<652:657>|box<671:674>|wire<687:691>|companion<696:705>|correctly<713:722>|sort<725:729>|wiring<738:744>|box<757:760>|box<757:762>|replace<770:779>|once<795:799>|instal<814:823>|red<832:835>|power<828:835>|pair<852:856>|leviton<879:886>|leviton app<879:891>|pairing<894:901>|straight<905:913>|forward<914:921>|neat<945:949>|feature<950:958>|connect<1003:1012>|siri<1015:1019>|home<1021:1025>|homekit<1021:1028>|homekit integration<1021:1040>|integration<1029:1040>|less<1044:1048>|easy<1049:1053>|pair<1076:1080>|apple<1086:1091>|apple home<1086:1096>|home<1092:1096>|first<1102:1107>|download<1132:1140>|firmware<1141:1149>|update<1150:1156>|firmware update<1141:1157>|update<1150:1157>|first<1158:1163>|system<1171:1177>|settings<1178:1186>|leviton<1194:1201>|leviton app<1194:1205>|the leviton app<1190:1205>|follow<1210:1216>|update<1221:1227>|prompt<1228:1235>|20 minute<1253:1263>|minute<1256:1263>|download<1267:1275>|firmware<1280:1288>|update<1289:1295>|update<1289:1296>|firmware update<1280:1296>|the firmware update<1276:1296>|once<1299:1303>|instal<1304:1313>|notice<1330:1336>|update<1343:1351>|matter<1359:1365>|matter protocol<1359:1374>|protocol<1366:1374>|accept<1389:1395>|update<1400:1406>|find<1426:1430>|matter<1436:1442>|pairing<1443:1450>|code<1451:1455>|device<1473:1479>|settings<1480:1488>|open<1506:1510>|home<1515:1519>|phone<1532:1537>|pair<1550:1554>|pair<1550:1557>|code<1558:1562>|qr<1566:1568>|code<1569:1573>|qr code<1566:1573>|add<1577:1580>|device<1585:1591>|apple<1595:1600>|apple home<1595:1605>|home<1601:1605>|same<1624:1628>|qr<1629:1631>|qr code<1629:1636>|code<1632:1636>|packaging<1657:1666>|siri<1680:1684>|control<1688:1695>|once<1707:1711>|add<1724:1727>|add<1724:1729>|home<1733:1737>",

I'd tried to read up about it and since my house isn't super new, I wasn't sure if what I had would work. But I shouldn't have worried.Does the wiring to your switch from your breaker box have a black, white, and ground wire (ground is either bare copper or green)? Congrats, you have a neutral wire and all these types of things will Just Work™.I don't know why people make it out like it's an unusual or \"new\" feature of wiring. You'd need REALLY old wiring not to have two wires going into your light switch.  Maybe if you have knob and tube wiring from the early 1900s...Anyway... the setup was really easy... pro tip, there's a QR Code on the inside of the switch itself that the app wants you to scan.... scan that before you install the switch!  You can still set it up via the Kasa app even without the QR code, but you need the code to do it from inside Google/Amazon/Alexa.It installed easily and obviously. It fits in a standard light switch box (though it fills a lot of the space, so you can't have a whole ton of wires hanging around behind it).  It dims my LED lights, and even turns on/off with a nice quick fade in/out.

At first I was not pleased with this but after an install in a 4 gang box, I see the value. I can place the wire nuts where I like in the box and then easily slide the dimmer in without having to force solid core wire (i.e. Romex).You setup the dimmers first in the My Leviton app. Then I went into the Apple Hone app to add the dimmers to my rooms using the QR code on the device. It all works very well.One area where the documentation and Amazon product listing is lacking is with regard to the remotes. The Amazon listing only shows the wireless remotes.  These are only useful if you are adding a new smart dimmer to a single control location box and you want to add another control location that is brand new. If you are adding or replacing a dimmer on a 3 way or 4 way wired circuit you have to buy a wired remote (obviously) but you have to go to the Leviton website to determine which wired remote to purchase.All in all 4.5 stars out of 5 with the deduction because of the wired remotes documentation issue FOR functionality and ease is setup/use.0 out 5 stars for manufacturing location.

      "Requires neutral white wire###require<0:8>|neutral<9:16>|white<17:22>|white wire<17:27>|wire<23:27>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2022-03-26] <b>Works Automatically, Less Great Manually</b> This switch is the right solution to a set of 6 bathroom lights that is way too bright, even with low-voltage LEDs. Bright is good for grooming, but bright is not good first thing in the morning or in the middle of the night. Putting in 6 dimmable bulbs was not a realistic solution, as they would have to be programmed individually then grouped in software. The Kasa Dimmer works perfectly on 6 LED lights.The dimming function is easy to use and provides full range from off to full-on bright. Installation is  easy. You do need a neutral white wire but all houses since the 1970s have that.  Determine if you need to buy a new faceplate. My installation was in a 3-ganged box and I could not find a faceplate for two rockers and one toggle, so I had to buy a cheap Leviton rocker (dumb switch) and replace the toggle so I could use a three-rocker faceplate. Buy a flexible faceplate (such as Enerlites) because it takes a little jiggling and cursing to get all the switches lined up perfectly and you do not want to crack the faceplate.The biggest downside to the Kasa dimmer is that when you touch it, it doesn't come on. It has to \"think\" for a couple of seconds, then it comes on gradually over half a second. If you're impatient and touch the switch again, you just turned it off. Ha-ha. This little game can go on for several cycles. When you walk into a room, you expect to touch a switch and get instant light. You do not expect to stop and  stand in front of the switch to see if it's going to work. This is a great annoyance, but ultimately a minor flaw. After a while you learn how to touch the Kasa switch just right so you have a 90% chance of success. It is, however a design flaw that makes the switch less than perfect.Integration with Alexa is seamless (once you link the accounts) and performance is rock-solid. I've never had a Kasa product fail on me, and I have plenty of them in the house.  Recommended.###automatically<9:22>|less<24:28>|manually<35:43>|solution<73:81>|set<87:90>|bathroom<96:104>|room<100:104>|bathroom light<96:111>|ha<113:115>|bright<128:134>|low<146:149>|voltage<150:157>|low voltage<146:157>|led<158:161>|led<158:162>|bright<164:170>|room<184:188>|bright<197:203>|first<216:221>|morning<235:242>|the middle<249:259>|middle<253:259>|night<267:272>|put<274:281>|dimmable<287:295>|bulb<296:301>|dimmable bulb<287:301>|solution<322:330>|ha<346:348>|program<357:367>|individually<368:380>|group<386:393>|software<397:405>|kasa<411:415>|dimmer<416:422>|perfectly<429:438>|led<444:447>|led light<444:454>|dim<459:466>|function<467:475>|easy<479:483>|provide<495:503>|full<504:508>|range<509:514>|full<527:531>|bright<535:541>|installation<543:555>|easy<560:564>|neutral<580:587>|white<588:593>|wire<594:598>|white wire<588:598>|house<607:612>|house<607:613>|ha<630:632>|ha<636:638>|determine<642:651>|new<673:676>|faceplate<677:686>|installation<691:703>|gang<715:721>|box<722:725>|find<742:746>|faceplate<749:758>|rock<767:771>|rocker<767:773>|rocker<767:774>|toggle<783:789>|ha<796:798>|cheap<809:814>|leviton<815:822>|rock<823:827>|rocker<823:829>|dumb<831:835>|replace<848:855>|toggle<860:866>|rock<890:894>|rocker<890:896>|faceplate<897:906>|flexible<914:922>|faceplate<923:932>|line<1024:1029>|perfectly<1033:1042>|faceplate<1076:1085>|big<1090:1097>|downside<1098:1106>|kasa<1114:1118>|dimmer<1119:1125>|ha<1130:1132>|touch<1143:1148>|ha<1176:1178>|couple<1197:1203>|a couple<1195:1203>|second<1207:1213>|second<1207:1214>|ha<1248:1250>|second<1255:1261>|touch<1287:1292>|again<1304:1309>|turn<1320:1326>|ha<1335:1337>|ha<1338:1340>|game<1354:1358>|cycle<1381:1387>|walk<1398:1402>|room<1410:1414>|touch<1430:1435>|instant<1453:1460>|stop<1489:1493>|stand<1499:1504>|front<1508:1513>|annoyance<1574:1583>|ultimately<1589:1599>|minor<1602:1607>|flaw<1608:1612>|while<1622:1627>|learn<1632:1637>|touch<1645:1650>|kasa<1655:1659>|ha<1685:1687>|ha<1697:1699>|chance<1696:1702>|success<1706:1713>|however<1722:1729>|design<1732:1738>|flaw<1739:1743>|design flaw<1732:1743>|ha<1745:1747>|less<1766:1770>|ha<1772:1774>|integration<1784:1795>|integration with alexa<1784:1806>|alexa<1801:1806>|seamless<1810:1818>|less<1814:1818>|link<1829:1833>|account<1838:1846>|performance<1852:1863>|rock<1867:1871>|solid<1872:1877>|never<1884:1889>|ha<1890:1892>|kasa<1896:1900>|fail<1909:1913>|ha<1927:1929>|plenty<1932:1938>|house<1954:1959>|recommend<1962:1973>",

Just scan the HomeKit QR (lower left of the recepitcal, you will have to remove the plastic trim to see it) by simply opening your iPhone camera and point it at the QR/HomeKit code label.- This newer model might be slightly deeper than the previous generation, but it did not cause me any problems.- Highly recommend using Wago 221 lever nuts (\"wire nuts\") to splice into your existing wiring. They work super great and allow you to quickly and easily make changes without stripping or bending wire (and they work well with stranded wire)- These switches have fixed electrical jumpers instead of traditional clamp screws. This is an improvement in my book, esp. since the wire is stranded. if you use Wago nuts, they make installation all the way faster. stranded wire has the benefit of being way more flexible so you don't have to fight it as much in cramped boxes.- These switches require a neutral (white) wire to work.###device<27:34>|second<43:49>|second generation<43:60>|generation<50:60>|late<84:90>|version<91:98>|apple<102:107>|ios<108:111>|apple<116:121>|phone<122:128>|early<133:140>|model<141:146>|anymore<177:184>|new<190:195>|ios<196:199>|version<200:207>|version<200:208>|early<223:230>|15 amp<254:261>|amp<257:261>|apple<328:333>|apple homekit<328:341>|homekit<334:341>|scan<348:352>|homekit<357:364>|qr<365:367>|low<369:374>|remove<416:422>|plastic<427:434>|trim<435:439>|simply<454:460>|open<461:468>|iphone<474:480>|camera<481:487>|point<492:497>|qr<508:510>|homekit<511:518>|code<519:523>|new<537:542>|model<543:548>|slightly<558:566>|deep<567:573>|previous<583:591>|generation<592:602>|cause<619:624>|highly<643:649>|recommend<650:659>|lever<675:680>|nut<681:685>|wire<688:692>|nut<693:697>|wire nut<688:697>|exist<720:728>|wiring<729:735>|super<747:752>|allow<763:768>|quickly<776:783>|easily<788:794>|change<800:807>|strip<816:825>|wire<837:841>|strand<867:875>|wire<876:880>|fix<903:908>|electrical<909:919>|instead<928:935>|traditional<939:950>|screw<957:963>|improvement<976:987>|wire<1015:1019>|strand<1023:1031>|nut<1049:1053>|installation<1065:1077>|fast<1090:1096>|strand<1098:1106>|wire<1107:1111>|benefit<1120:1127>|flexible<1146:1154>|require<1227:1234>|neutral<1237:1244>|white<1246:1251>|white wire<1246:1257>|wire<1253:1257>",

I did load up the Leviton app and run through the Leviton gauntlet to use the app WITHOUT creating an account by telling the Leviton app you just want to use with Apple HomeKit and Siri and NOT use it with other integrations tied to an account with Leviton. I say WAIT for full Matter support because once these are delivered with the Matter firmware, you will NOT have to create a Leviton account, which is currently required to install the early adopter Matter firmware. It makes sense that Leviton requires an account to install the Matter firmware because your account will save the all important Matter QR code that your device will be unusable without once you update to Matter. Eventually the Matter QR codes will be attached to the switch and it will not require fooling around with yet another app, just use your Matter controller and off you go.But for my current use, the HomeKit native use was great. The Leviton build is superior to my ReFoss, partly due to a \"rocker\" momentary dual contact switch vs. the ReFoss which has a single momentary contact that you press the bottom of the switch to both turn On and Off while the Leviton has the more natural press the top for on, the bottom for off. As an added benefit when wired 3 way, pressing the top will be ON vs. the normal problem with mechanical 3 way switches that flip back and forth between up/down for on/off.So far my economy Refoss has been fine, but I'd probably go with the tp-link tapo for an economy Matter over WiFi.I had a neutral wire to support the higher power use of a WiFi switch. This WiFi Leviton Decora is probably a step down from the Lutron Caseta, but simpler to use where I don't have a ZigBee or Lutron Clear Connect RF hub handy.###wait<3:7>|full<20:24>|matter<25:31>|matter support<25:39>|support<32:39>|home<49:53>|homekit<49:56>|native<57:63>|home<98:102>|homekit<98:105>|ignore<114:120>|leviton<132:139>|instruction<140:152>|add<163:166>|accessory<167:176>|room<198:202>|add<215:218>|home<245:249>|leviton<282:289>|leviton app<282:293>|the leviton app<278:293>|version<314:321>|firmware<333:341>|load<367:371>|leviton<379:386>|leviton app<379:390>|the leviton app<375:390>|run<395:398>|leviton<411:418>|create<451:459>|account<463:470>|an account<460:470>|leviton<486:493>|leviton app<486:497>|the leviton app<482:497>|apple<524:529>|home<530:534>|homekit<530:537>|apple homekit<524:537>|siri<542:546>|integration<573:585>|tie<586:590>|account<597:604>|an account<594:604>|leviton<610:617>|wait<625:629>|full<634:638>|matter<639:645>|support<646:653>|matter support<639:653>|matter<696:702>|matter firmware<696:711>|firmware<703:711>|the matter firmware<692:711>|create<734:740>|leviton<743:750>|account<751:758>|current<769:776>|currently<769:778>|require<779:786>|require<779:787>|install<791:798>|early<803:808>|matter<817:823>|matter firmware<817:832>|firmware<824:832>|sense<843:848>|leviton<854:861>|require<862:869>|require<862:870>|an account<871:881>|account<874:881>|install<885:892>|matter<897:903>|matter firmware<897:912>|firmware<904:912>|the matter firmware<893:912>|account<926:933>|save<939:943>|important<952:961>|matter<962:968>|qr<969:971>|qr code<969:976>|code<972:976>|device<987:993>|unusable<1002:1010>|update<1028:1034>|matter<1038:1044>|eventually<1046:1056>|matter<1061:1067>|qr<1068:1070>|qr code<1068:1075>|code<1071:1075>|code<1071:1076>|qr code<1068:1076>|attach<1085:1093>|require<1124:1131>|yet<1152:1155>|matter<1183:1189>|controller<1190:1200>|current<1227:1234>|home<1244:1248>|homekit<1244:1251>|native<1252:1258>|leviton<1278:1285>|build<1286:1291>|superior<1295:1303>|rocker<1335:1341>|dual<1353:1357>|contact<1358:1365>|single<1400:1406>|contact<1417:1424>|press<1434:1439>|bottom<1444:1450>|turn<1473:1477>|leviton<1499:1506>|press<1528:1533>|top<1538:1541>|bottom<1554:1560>|add<1576:1579>|add<1576:1581>|benefit<1582:1589>|wire<1595:1599>|wire<1595:1600>|3 way<1601:1606>|press<1608:1613>|press<1608:1616>|top<1621:1624>|normal<1644:1650>|problem<1651:1658>|mechanical<1664:1674>|3 way<1675:1680>|3 way switch<1675:1689>|flip<1695:1699>|back<1700:1704>|forth<1709:1714>|down<1726:1730>|far<1745:1748>|probably<1790:1798>|tp<1811:1813>|tp link<1811:1818>|the tp link<1807:1818>|link<1814:1818>|tapo<1819:1823>|matter<1839:1845>|wifi<1851:1855>|neutral<1864:1871>|wire<1872:1876>|neutral wire<1864:1876>|a neutral wire<1862:1876>|support<1880:1887>|high<1892:1898>|power<1899:1904>|wifi<1914:1918>|wifi<1932:1936>|leviton<1937:1944>|decora<1945:1951>|leviton decora<1937:1951>|probably<1955:1963>|step<1966:1970>|down<1971:1975>|lutron<1985:1991>|caseta<1992:1998>|lutron caseta<1985:1998>|simple<2004:2011>|zigbee<2040:2046>|lutron<2050:2056>|clear<2057:2062>|connect<2063:2070>|hub<2074:2077>|handy<2078:2083>",

My house’s wires were not colored or labeled so that had me doing some running up and down to the breaker and see which wire went where, but outside of that, easy peasy. The app works really well, and we have a Google smart home eco system going with the Home and the Minis, and the Kasa app  integrates seamlessly with our devices. Used it in 2 bedrooms and the living room. I will say not all light fixtures are going to dim so seamlessly, like my living room lights. The bedrooms have flush mount LED disk lights, and those dim more smoothly. Regardless, we’re happy with the switches and would get them again. I’d like to try the 3-way switches next.###simple<3:9>|set<10:13>|set up<10:16>|find<18:22>|wire<33:37>|wire<33:38>|hot<43:46>|first<47:52>|pretty<58:64>|simple<65:71>|system<72:78>|house<115:120>|wire<123:127>|wire<123:128>|color<138:145>|label<149:156>|run<183:190>|down<198:202>|breaker<210:217>|wire<232:236>|easy<270:274>|easy<276:280>|google<323:329>|smart<330:335>|home<336:340>|smart home<330:340>|system<345:351>|home<367:371>|kasa<395:399>|the kasa app<391:403>|kasa app<395:403>|integrate<405:415>|seamlessly<416:426>|device<436:443>|room<461:465>|bedroom<458:466>|living<475:481>|living room<475:486>|the living room<471:486>|room<482:486>|fixture<513:521>|light fixture<507:521>|dim<535:538>|seamlessly<542:552>|living<562:568>|room<569:573>|living room<562:573>|living room light<562:580>|room<589:593>|bedroom<586:594>|flush<600:605>|mount<606:611>|flush mount<600:611>|lead<612:615>|dim<639:642>|smoothly<648:656>|regardless<658:668>|happy<676:681>|again<719:724>|3 way<746:751>|3 way switch<746:760>|next<761:765>",

It was a pain to have to go up every year during daylight savings to change it. I had a kitchen remodel in 2021. I had asked one of the guys to put the lights on a switch in the kitchen. I guess I didn't communicate it well enough cause he just took lights off dimmer and put them on a switch in the attic.  4 years later, I FINALLY decided to go up myself and move lights from attic switch to a hall switch that controlled lights in garage and over garage door. That wire came to the attic, but was for a three way switch that was buried in wall. I could get to it, but I'd have to splice to it. That was gonna be my \"plan b\".  After frustration cleared, I wondered if there was a switch that could be controlled by an app. After searching on Amazon, I found this Lutton app controlled switch. It was EXACTLY what I was looking for and hoping it would be. It is PERFECT.It has 5 wires so you can wire it for a single pole switch (Black goes to power \"Line\", Red goes to lights \"Load\", White \"Neutral \", Green \"Ground\") and there's also a Yellow wire that is taped that is only used for a three way switch application.Once hooked up, you get a green flashing light which lets you know it's connected and working. Download Lutton app and the setup is easy.It took me 4 years to finally get this project done. I always say, there's a time and place for everything. Just wish I had known about this Lutton app controlled switch sooner!!

The requirements are simple, a neutral return in the electrical box the switch is installed in and an Apple TV or HomePod to act as the hub.The Decora Smart switches can operate both as single pole switches, or three or more way switches with companion switches in the remote locations; wireless companions switches are available to convert single pole configurations to three way or more. I have installed switches in both single pole and wired three way lighting circuits without trouble. Both installation types are straightforward. Retrofit of existing lighting is easy, and the pigtail connections are easy to make with the supplied wire nuts.###home<19:23>|homekit<19:26>|home<31:35>|require<50:57>|separate<58:66>|hub<67:70>|smart<93:98>|other smart switch<87:107>|require<114:121>|separate<122:130>|expensive<132:141>|hub<142:145>|hub<142:146>|privacy<150:157>|challenge<158:169>|internet<170:178>|account<179:187>|decora<193:199>|series<200:206>|install<226:233>|instal<226:235>|configure<240:250>|directly<259:267>|home<277:281>|simply<287:293>|install<294:301>|add<314:317>|accessory<322:331>|home<340:344>|require<372:379>|requirement<372:384>|simple<389:395>|neutral<399:406>|return<407:413>|electrical<421:431>|electrical box<421:435>|the electrical box<417:435>|box<432:435>|install<450:457>|instal<450:459>|apple<470:475>|an apple<467:475>|tv<476:478>|home<482:486>|act<493:496>|hub<504:507>|decora<512:518>|smart<519:524>|decora smart<512:524>|decora smart switch<512:533>|operate<538:545>|single<554:560>|pole<561:565>|single pole<554:565>|single pole switch<554:574>|companion<611:620>|remote<637:643>|location<644:653>|wire<655:659>|wireless<655:663>|companion<664:673>|companion<664:674>|available<688:697>|convert<701:708>|single<709:715>|single pole<709:720>|pole<716:720>|configuration<721:735>|three way<739:748>|install<765:772>|instal<765:774>|single<792:798>|pole<799:803>|single pole<792:803>|wire<808:812>|wire<808:813>|three way<814:823>|lighting<824:832>|circuit<833:841>|trouble<850:857>|install<864:871>|installation<864:876>|type<877:882>|straightforward<887:902>|retrofit<904:912>|exist<916:924>|lighting<925:933>|easy<937:941>|pigtail<951:958>|connection<959:970>|easy<975:979>|supply<997:1005>|wire<1006:1010>|wire nut<1006:1015>|nut<1011:1015>",

Potentially extra work to install them though.</b> Originally had Belkin Wemo smart dimmers installed, but I had too many issues with them and finally replaced them with dimmer switches that actually work.Setup was a breeze, but installation was slightly annoying for me.  The other TP-link switches I have installed had wires extending out that you connected via wire nuts, so you could bundle multiples of these in the same switch box.  This one had screws and anchor plates on the side that required wires be inserted and screwed down to make the connection.  It required me to split some speaker wire, and connect the split wires from the neutral to the devices.  It's not pretty, but it works, and it's hidden behind the cover plate.  I take off a star for that.  If I could do a half star, I would because it wasn't that much of an inconvenience for me.Operation-wise, these work as designed.  I have Kasa smart switches all over my house and I've only ever had good experiences with setup and configuration.  These integrate wonderfully into Alexa, and are quick to respond.Don't mess around with other smart switches that require you to get a hub, get these and be done with it.

So an already bulky switch that at least had side mounted wiring connections, now takes up even more space. Try fitting five wire nuts behind this switch in a standard single gang electrical box. Good luck. It feels like this was either reimagined by an engineer who has never taken a switch plate off or someone in cost controls trying to limit the price of making this switch.It’s a bummer because functionality they are great. The app is simple and just frankly works. These things lose their glory at the form factor and sheer size. Now with Gen 2, they are even harder to actually get in a wall.###design<19:25>|design<19:27>|bulky<37:42>|ever<82:86>|gen<96:99>|version<102:109>|version<102:110>|fail<150:154>|3 year<167:174>|year<169:174>|year of use<169:181>|gen<188:191>|version<194:201>|clearly<205:212>|engineer<216:224>|design<227:233>|one<235:238>|office<257:263>|one<272:275>|ever<287:291>|touch<292:299>|screwdriver<302:313>|gen<320:323>|repeatedly<328:338>|fail<339:343>|fail<339:345>|short<356:361>|period<367:373>|gen<379:382>|now<396:399>|pigtail<410:417>|wiring<418:424>|require<430:437>|wire<438:442>|wire nut<438:447>|nut<443:447>|already<455:462>|bulky<463:468>|least<484:489>|side<494:498>|mount<499:506>|wiring<507:513>|connection<514:525>|now<527:530>|space<550:555>|more space<545:555>|fit<561:568>|wire<574:578>|wire nut<574:583>|nut<579:583>|standard<608:616>|single<617:623>|single gang<617:628>|gang<624:628>|electrical<629:639>|box<640:643>|electrical box<629:643>|good luck<645:654>|luck<650:654>|feel<659:664>|either<679:685>|engineer<703:711>|ever<721:725>|never<720:725>|plate<741:746>|one<758:761>|cost<765:769>|control<770:778>|limit<789:794>|price<799:804>|functionality<849:862>|simple<890:896>|lose<934:938>|form<958:962>|factor<963:969>|size<980:984>|now<986:989>|gen<995:998>|hard<1016:1022>|actually<1026:1034>|wall<1044:1048>",
      "Wire leads and wire nuts###wire<0:4>|lead<5:10>|wire<15:19>|wire nut<15:24>|nut<20:24>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★★★ [2021-09-01] <b>Nice to see new models.  Looking forward to seeing how they perform.</b> I have many of the Gen 1 devices in my house.  Leviton has been my favorite brand for switches.  I also have tried Legrand and Aqara switches but always come back to Leviton as my fav.Pros:#1) 2.4GHz only:  I know a lot of people complain about this.  But I find this to be a benefit.  HomeKit does not need the bandwidth of 5GHz.  Most dual band mesh networks share a SSID and mine in particular (Orbi) cannot be separated.  My Gen 1 Decora Smart switches were constantly dropping with any WiFi interruption.  And these are the only HomeKit devices I have other than Apple TV and HomePods that are dual band devices.  I am looking forward to see how these new switches handle the same interruptions.#2) Self grounding:  The metal mounting flanges are self-grounding to metal switch boxes with grounded conduit.  This eliminates the need to use the ground wire.  I liked this about Gen 1 and am happy to see this also on the Gen 2.  Other brands use plastic mounting flanges that require the use of the ground wire.#3) It has both wireless and wired options for 3 way connections.  If you have a Gen 1 switch installed in a 3-way set up with a DD0SR coordinated remote this is a drop in replacement.  And now it gives you the option to use a wireless remote as well.Cons:#1) Setup:  The setup didn’t seem to go as smoothly as the Gen 1.  I attempted to add directly to Home App multiple times.  I reset the switch, restarted my phone, but could never “connect” to the switch when adding accessory.  I ended up having to add to the new Leviton app first, and then add to HomeKit via the Home app.  I also bought the new Gen 2 dimmer wall plug and had same experience.  I am not sure if it’s my system or the new device, but it wasn’t the experience I’m used to.#2) Wire Leads:  The Gen 1 had screw connections.  This is by far a better way to install IMO.  The leads and wire nuts take too much space.###new<15:18>|model<19:25>|forward<36:43>|perform<63:70>|gen<95:98>|device<101:107>|device<101:108>|house<115:120>|leviton<123:130>|favorite<143:151>|brand<152:157>|always<222:228>|back<234:238>|leviton<242:249>|now<286:289>|people<299:305>|lot of people<292:305>|complain<306:314>|find<334:338>|benefit<352:359>|home<362:366>|homekit<362:369>|band<388:392>|bandwidth<388:397>|most<408:412>|dual<413:417>|band<418:422>|mesh<423:427>|mesh network<423:436>|network<428:436>|share<437:442>|ssid<445:449>|particular<462:472>|orbi<474:478>|separate<490:499>|gen<505:508>|decora<511:517>|decora smart<511:523>|smart<518:523>|decora smart switch<511:532>|constantly<538:548>|drop<549:553>|drop<549:557>|wifi<567:571>|interruption<572:584>|home<610:614>|homekit<610:617>|device<618:624>|device<618:625>|apple<644:649>|tv<650:652>|home<657:661>|dual<675:679>|band<680:684>|device<685:691>|device<685:692>|forward<708:715>|new<733:736>|handle<746:752>|same<757:761>|interruption<762:774>|self<780:784>|ground<785:791>|ground<785:794>|metal<801:806>|mount<807:815>|flange<816:823>|self<828:832>|ground<833:839>|ground<833:842>|metal<846:851>|box<859:864>|ground<870:876>|ground<870:878>|eliminate<894:904>|ground<925:931>|ground wire<925:936>|wire<932:936>|gen<958:961>|happy<971:976>|gen<1001:1004>|brand<1015:1020>|brand<1015:1021>|other brand<1009:1021>|plastic<1026:1033>|mount<1034:1042>|flange<1043:1050>|require<1056:1063>|ground<1079:1085>|ground wire<1079:1090>|wire<1086:1090>|wire<1107:1111>|wireless<1107:1115>|wire<1120:1124>|wired<1120:1125>|option<1126:1132>|option<1126:1133>|3 way<1138:1143>|connect<1144:1151>|connection<1144:1155>|gen<1172:1175>|install<1185:1192>|instal<1185:1194>|3 way<1200:1205>|set<1206:1209>|remote<1238:1244>|drop<1255:1259>|replacement<1263:1274>|now<1281:1284>|give<1288:1293>|option<1302:1308>|wire<1318:1322>|wireless<1318:1326>|remote<1327:1333>|setup<1351:1356>|set<1363:1366>|setup<1363:1368>|smoothly<1390:1398>|gen<1406:1409>|attempt<1416:1425>|add<1429:1432>|directly<1433:1441>|home<1445:1449>|multiple<1454:1462>|multiple time<1454:1468>|reset<1473:1478>|set<1475:1478>|restart<1491:1500>|phone<1504:1509>|never<1521:1526>|connect<1528:1535>|add<1556:1559>|add<1556:1562>|accessory<1563:1572>|end<1577:1582>|add<1596:1599>|new<1607:1610>|leviton<1611:1618>|leviton app<1611:1622>|first<1623:1628>|add<1639:1642>|home<1646:1650>|homekit<1646:1653>|home<1662:1666>|new<1691:1694>|gen<1695:1698>|dimmer<1701:1707>|wall<1708:1712>|plug<1713:1717>|same<1726:1730>|experience<1731:1741>|system<1769:1775>|new<1783:1786>|device<1787:1793>|experience<1813:1823>|wire<1840:1844>|lead<1845:1850>|gen<1857:1860>|screw<1867:1872>|connect<1873:1880>|connection<1873:1884>|far<1898:1901>|install<1918:1925>|lead<1936:1941>|wire<1946:1950>|nut<1951:1955>|wire nut<1946:1955>|space<1970:1975>",

This made the installation of a switch and dimmer today much longer to do. Last week, I had to do a 3-gang box (all 1st Gen switches) because one of them failed. Replacing it with a new 2nd Gen switch was a pain in-the-you-know-what. Had to redo the whole box because of the different wiring. If there were screw terminals, most of the time it's simply backing off the old switch/dimmer (dumb or smart) and \"dropping in\" the new (with the exception on the neutral wires).Though the 2nd Gen switches/dimmers are a bit shallower, having to now use wire nuts and addition of lead wires adds EXTRA stuff being pushed in the workbox. You are NOT saving on space. I ended up cutting back several lead wires to save on space.I haven't had enough time to comment about performance but I did notice that these connected to Wi-Fi extremely fast vs the 1st Gen switches/dimmers that I have - within seconds(!!) of the power being turned back on after installation.###bring<3:8>|back<9:13>|screw<18:23>|2nd<42:45>|2nd gen<42:49>|the 2nd gen<38:49>|gen<46:49>|2nd gen switch<42:56>|2nd gen switch<42:58>|dimmer<59:65>|dimmer<59:66>|now<67:70>|lead<78:82>|wire<83:87>|wire<83:88>|hang<89:96>|box<106:109>|instead<110:117>|screw<121:126>|screw terminal<121:136>|terminal<127:136>|installation<152:164>|dimmer<181:187>|today<188:193>|long<199:205>|last<213:217>|week<218:222>|3 gang<238:244>|gang<240:244>|3 gang box<238:248>|gang box<240:248>|box<245:248>|1st<254:257>|gen<258:261>|1st gen<254:261>|1st gen switch<254:270>|fail<292:298>|replace<300:309>|new<320:323>|2nd<324:327>|gen<328:331>|2nd gen<324:331>|2nd gen switch<324:338>|pain<345:349>|a pain<343:349>|now<362:365>|whole<388:393>|box<394:397>|different<413:422>|wiring<423:429>|screw<445:450>|terminal<451:460>|screw terminal<445:460>|most<462:466>|simply<484:490>|back<491:495>|back<491:498>|old<507:510>|dimmer<518:524>|dumb<526:530>|smart<534:539>|drop<546:554>|new<563:566>|exception<577:586>|neutral<594:601>|wire<602:606>|wire<602:607>|2nd<620:623>|the 2nd gen<616:627>|2nd gen<620:627>|gen<624:627>|2nd gen switch<620:634>|2nd gen switch<620:636>|dimmer<637:643>|dimmer<637:644>|now<676:679>|wire<684:688>|nut<689:693>|wire nut<684:693>|addition<698:706>|lead<710:714>|wire<715:719>|wire<715:720>|add<721:725>|extra<726:731>|push<744:750>|box<762:765>|save<779:785>|space<789:794>|end<798:803>|cut<807:814>|back<815:819>|lead<828:832>|wire<833:837>|wire<833:838>|save<842:846>|space<850:855>|comment<885:892>|performance<899:910>|notice<921:927>|connect<939:948>|wi<952:954>|fi<955:957>|wi fi<952:957>|extremely<958:967>|fast<968:972>|1st<980:983>|1st gen<980:987>|gen<984:987>|1st gen switch<980:996>|dimmer<997:1003>|dimmer<997:1004>|second<1026:1033>|power<1045:1050>|turn<1057:1063>|back<1064:1068>|installation<1078:1090>",

Overall, prefer 1st gen</b> This switch would've been 5 stars/awesome, if they had kept the original physical design, which used screw terminals. As others have noted, this comes with wires that need to be wire-nutted in place, which adds a lot of bulk. In my case, There were other connections within my single-gang box, and the addition of three more wire nuts was not possible. If this were the original design, I could've simply dropped in the new switch to the old wires, but instead I had to take everything apart, add larger/bulkier wire nuts in order to accommodate the additional wires, and eventually needed a bigger box. Wifi setup was nice and easy, though. Unfortunately, the negative they introduced with this redesign outweigh the positives. I would've preferred another 1st gen switch, but they don't sell them anymore from the look of things.###lack<3:7>|screw<11:16>|screw terminal<11:26>|terminal<17:26>|ease<36:40>|wifi<44:48>|setup<49:54>|plus<57:61>|overall<63:70>|prefer<72:78>|1st<79:82>|gen<83:86>|1st gen<79:86>|5 star<117:124>|keep<146:150>|original<155:163>|physical<164:172>|design<173:179>|screw<192:197>|terminal<198:207>|screw terminal<192:207>|note<224:229>|wire<247:251>|wire<247:252>|wire<269:273>|wire nut<269:280>|nut<274:280>|place<284:289>|add<297:300>|add<297:301>|case<323:327>|connection<346:357>|single<368:374>|gang<375:379>|single gang<368:379>|gang box<375:383>|box<380:383>|single gang box<368:383>|add<393:396>|addition<393:401>|wire<416:420>|wire nut<416:425>|nut<421:425>|possible<434:442>|original<461:469>|design<470:476>|simply<489:495>|drop<496:503>|new<511:514>|old<529:532>|wire<533:537>|wire<533:538>|instead<544:551>|apart<577:582>|add<584:587>|large<588:594>|wire<603:607>|wire nut<603:612>|nut<608:612>|add<641:644>|addition<641:649>|additional<641:651>|wire<652:656>|wire<652:657>|eventually<663:673>|big<683:689>|big box<683:693>|box<690:693>|wifi<695:699>|setup<700:705>|easy<719:723>|though<725:731>|unfortunately<733:746>|negative<752:760>|design<789:795>|redesign<787:795>|prefer<831:837>|prefer<831:840>|1st<849:852>|1st gen<849:856>|gen<853:856>|1st gen switch<849:863>|sell<880:884>|anymore<890:897>",

Requires app for install and updates.</b> These are smart / WiFi dimmers that are hard-wired into a junction box for switched lights.Only supports 2.4 Ghz WifI band -- some of the hardware variants used in individual dimmers will stay connected indefinitely and some will disconnect and reconnect randomly and as frequently every few minutes.  It apparently has to do with the WiFi chips, firmware, or both.Sometimes the brightness level LEDs on the top if the dimmer will get stuck and stay on and at other times, they turn off after a few seconds.Alexa integration is OK for basic functions, but gets complicated rapidly as the number of named devices increases. You will need to come up with creative names if, for example, you have more than one dimmer per named room and then you will have to remember which are which. There is no alexa integration for calibration. firmware updates, or time or time zone adjustments.These dimmers work for most light sources:  incandescent (but wattage is limited to 200) and some dimmable fluorescent and some LED bulbs.Requires an app for initial installation, dimmer calibration, and for firmware or time updates.There is no easy reference source on the product page for bulb compatibility, so be sure you test your bulbs before going to the trouble to install these dimmers.Worked poorly on Feit LED candelabra bulbs: there was noticeable bulb flickering at dimming levels below 60 percent.Single pole (one switch) only.  Requires a neutral and ground connection, so there will be four wire connections per dimmer (green, white, and two for the controlled device).  Oddly, the green and white connections require wire nuts but the line and load are screwed into the side of the dimmer.Large back cover uses a lot of space in the junction box, so not the best choice for small or crowded junction boxes.The front up and down controls are too small and should be bigger.The indicator LED bulb is very dim and cannot be seen in a bright room.  A dimmable indicator on a dimmer would have been be a logical design choice, but it's not available on this model.There still is no web interface for these smart dimmers -- only app controls.  The Apple app does not support accessibility options and is not suitable for those with vision issues -- moreover, the contrast and size on the app screens is very poor even for those with good vision -- especially if your Apple device uses adaptive backlighting.There is a removable, screwless faceplate which is a nice feature. The face plate and switch front are a high gloss finish that shows fingerprints and scratches; a matte finish would be much better.There are two very small, unmarked and hard-to-access switches built into the dimmer bottom.  One reboots the dimmer without removing the programming and account information. The other wipes the device and removes it from an account.For those who prefer a flawless installation, be sure that the dimmer is not angled when you screw it into the junction box.  If there is any angle, the face plate will not fit flush with the dimmer. This is especially important if there are more than one switch or dimmer in a junction box.###design<16:22>|web<30:33>|interface<34:43>|face<39:43>|require<45:53>|install<62:69>|update<74:81>|smart<97:102>|wifi<105:109>|dim<110:113>|dimmer<110:116>|dimmer<110:117>|hard<127:131>|wire<132:136>|wire<132:137>|junction<145:153>|box<154:157>|junction

They are still (mostly) my favorite excepting two things, 1 they seem to be at least softly discontinued, not advertised anymore and hard to find in stock, 2: the D26HD supports double tap to max brightness, which the Zigbee DG6HD does not have. Because of these 2 reasons, I reluctantly tried the D26HD and find it an acceptable alternative; however, I'd still prefer a Thread or Zigbee-based version as D26HD requires a My Leviton account, access to your wifi, access to your precision location on your mobile, access to your wi-fi password, and Internet access, and is harder to set up than Zigbee switches for those who know what is Zigbee and have a Zigbee hub. If you want Matter you have to use My Leviton to set it up first, opt into Matter early access, and upgrade your firmware. This was \"easy enough\". Not as easy as Zigbee you click one button in Home Assistant and done though. The Zigbee versions also allow access to fade in/out timers, but Matter mode does not, at least in HA as of writing this review; however, you can configure it via My Leviton app. I have not yet tested if the device works when restricted from the Internet in Matter mode.I use this with the DD00R companion for multi-location dimming. I did not want to use the \"anywhere\" battery-operated switches so utilized existing multi-pole wiring. Wiring is standard. Compared to DG6HD's screw terminals the D26HD uses pigtails -- some find this as a pro, some as con. The DD00R is compatible with the double tap to max on / off, which surprised me since it was made for gen 1 devices that don't support it; HOWEVER, if you double tap the DD00R quickly it recognizes as a single tap while on the D26HD it works perfectly.Using remote control via My Leviton and via Matter through Home Assistant appears instant. I opted to use My Leviton as little as possible so I use Google Assistant integration via Home Assistant instead of My Leviton. In Home Assistant Matter only the on/off and dim level is supported, which for me supports all everyday use case. In My Leviton you can change bulb type, min and max dim power levels, and fade on and fade off time settings in 0.5 second increments and upgrade firmware, which is a \"one time\" expected use for me.In general, I am anti-wifi for smart devices due to the lower reliability I've typically witnessed and inappropriate for battery-powered devices, but as a wired device it is OK enough, although if Leviton drops cloud support you lose the advanced configuration functionality. I still prefer the privacy-centric features and cloud-free Zigbee DG6HD, but again they seem to be on the way out. A great improvement will be when Matter comes out-of-the-box so you can enroll it without Internet or My Leviton, and if the advanced features can be supported (if possible) via

The Kasa Switches are easier to install and require fewer wire nuts than the prior switches, making them easier to fit into the boxes. The Kasa App and integration with Alexa was smooth, with a minor exception. I received version 3.26 and 3.6 of the single pole switches, which operated differently during the integration. The 3.26 took multiple attempts to integrate with Alexa. All eventually connected, but the 3.26 version took more time and attempts.The three-way switches require that you purchase a pair, which takes a bit more installation time and costs more. I would have liked a 3-way switch that worked with existing non-smart switches.The design of the switches is clean, and they look great.###solid<3:8>|smart<9:14>|smart switches<9:23>|switches<15:23>|simple<28:34>|integration<35:46>|alexa<50:55>|new<73:76>|kasa<77:81>|kasa smart<77:87>|smart<82:87>|smart switches<82:96>|switches<88:96>|replace<100:107>|exist<111:119>|treatlife<120:129>|start<144:151>|become<155:161>|unresponsive<162:174>|kasa<180:184>|switches<185:193>|easy<198:204>|install<208:215>|require<220:227>|wire<234:238>|wire nut<234:243>|nut<239:243>|prior<253:258>|easy<281:287>|fit<291:294>|box<304:309>|kasa<315:319>|the kasa app<311:323>|kasa app<315:323>|integration<328:339>|integration with alexa<328:350>|alexa<345:350>|smooth<355:361>|minor<370:375>|exception<376:385>|receive<389:397>|version<398:405>|single<426:432>|single pole<426:437>|pole<433:437>|single pole switch<426:446>|operate<454:462>|integration<486:497>|multiple<513:521>|multiple attempt<513:530>|attempt<522:530>|integrate<534:543>|alexa<549:554>|eventually<560:570>|connect<571:580>|version<595:602>|attempt<622:630>|three way<635:644>|three way switch<635:653>|require<654:661>|pair<682:686>|install<711:718>|installation<711:723>|cost<733:738>|3 way<766:771>|3 way switch<766:778>|exist<796:804>|non<805:808>|smart<809:814>|non smart switch<805:823>|design<828:834>|clean<854:859>",

I plan to install these everywhere in my homes, and parents homes, and friends homes, once there is a 3 way dimmer switch option.Good: This product is awesome. I've installed a couple of these dimmer switches. This is an awesome upgrade towards a smart home for $25 (or less). This product replaces the need for smart bulbs and a hub. I've installed this in a 3 gang box next to 3 way switches. It can be a little intimidating to mess with home wiring (I'm a mechanical engineer so I prefer to treat electricity as black magic), but once you figure out what wires you are looking at, it's not difficult. They supply leads on the ground and neutral with two wire nuts which makes it really easy to connect. The app walks you through the install.Bad: I wish that tp link was compatible with Apple HomeKit (like they promised when I initially started buying their smart home products).

There is a \"traveler\" wire on the unit. But, there are no instructions on what it's purpose is. It is apparently not used in a 3-way circuit. The remote switch is actually for use with a WiFI dimmer and is battery operated. But, it works with the WiFi switch, too. It can be mounted anywhere (nice). But, it costs another $26. Other manufacturers (Kasa) are much cheaper for the single switch which function properly as a 3-way switch using two \"travelers\" to carry power to the existing remote switch - just like a conventional 3-way switch. That's a much better and less expensive design. DON'T FALL FOR THE THIRD PARTY TECH SUPPORT LINE. IT IS BASICALLY A SCAM CHARGING A HIGH MONTHLY FEE.

There is a \"traveler\" wire on the unit. But, there are no instructions on what it's purpose is. It is apparently not used in a 3-way circuit. The remote switch is actually for use with a WiFI dimmer and is battery operated. But, it works with the WiFi switch, too. It can be mounted anywhere (nice). But, it costs another $26. Other manufacturers (Kasa) are much cheaper for the single switch which function properly as a 3-way switch using two \"travelers\" to carry power to the existing remote switch - just like a conventional 3-way switch. That's a much better and less expensive design. DON'T FALL FOR THE THIRD PARTY TECH SUPPORT LINE. IT IS BASICALLY A SCAM CHARGING A HIGH MONTHLY FEE.

      "Requires companion switch for 3-way circuit###require<0:8>|companion<9:18>|3 way<30:35>|circuit<36:43>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★★☆ [2023-10-23] <b>Works with Apple Home/ Siri, but . . .</b> I installed this smart switch to replace a mechanical 3-way switch.  This was my second installation of this switch, but the first 3-way circuit.  You need to identify the hot wire in your box, and you need a neutral wire.  If you're comfortable with wiring, the installation is pretty straight forward (but a tight fit.) If you're creating a 3-way circuit, you must also wire a smart companion switch into the other box.  The wiring of the companion switch is very different from a mechanical switch, so read the wiring diagram carefully.  You need to be able to identify the red vs. red/yellow companion wires in the other box in order to wire the companion switch correctly.  Sort all the wiring out in both boxes before replacing the switches.  Once the switch is installed and powered up, you need to pair the switch to the \"My Leviton\" app.  Pairing is straight-forward, and there are lots of neat features you can use from the app when the switch is connected.  Siri/ Homekit integration is less easy.  The switch will not pair with Apple Home when first energized.  You need to download firmware updates first. Go to System Settings on the Leviton app and follow the update prompts.  It takes about 20 minutes to download the firmware updates.  Once installed, you will get a notice about updating to the Matter protocol. Say yes, and accept the update.  You then need to find the \"Matter Pairing Code\", which is under Device Settings for the switch.  Open the Home app on your phone and use the pairing code or QR-code to add the device to Apple Home.  This is NOT the same QR code that comes with the packaging. You can use Siri to control the switch once it has been added to Home.###apple<14:19>|home<20:24>|apple home<14:24>|siri<26:30>|instal<48:57>|smart<63:68>|replace<79:86>|mechanical<89:99>|3 way<100:105>|3 way switch<100:112>|second<127:133>|installation<134:146>|first<171:176>|3 way<177:182>|circuit<183:190>|identify<205:213>|hot<218:221>|hot wire<218:226>|wire<222:226>|box<235:238>|neutral<255:262>|neutral wire<255:267>|wire<263:267>|a neutral wire<253:267>|comfortable<280:291>|able<287:291>|wiring<297:303>|installation<309:321>|pretty<325:331>|straight<332:340>|forward<341:348>|tight<356:361>|tight fit<356:365>|a tight fit<354:365>|fit<362:365>|create<378:386>|3 way<389:394>|circuit<395:402>|wire<418:422>|smart<425:430>|companion<431:440>|box<463:466>|wiring<473:479>|companion<487:496>|different<512:521>|mechanical<529:539>|read<551:555>|wiring<560:566>|diagram<567:574>|carefully<575:584>|able<602:606>|identify<610:618>|red<623:626>|red<631:634>|companion<642:651>|wire<652:656>|wire<652:657>|box<671:674>|wire<687:691>|companion<696:705>|correctly<713:722>|sort<725:729>|wiring<738:744>|box<757:760>|box<757:762>|replace<770:779>|once<795:799>|instal<814:823>|red<832:835>|power<828:835>|pair<852:856>|leviton<879:886>|leviton app<879:891>|pairing<894:901>|straight<905:913>|forward<914:921>|neat<945:949>|feature<950:958>|connect<1003:1012>|siri<1015:1019>|home<1021:1025>|homekit<1021:1028>|homekit integration<1021:1040>|integration<1029:1040>|less<1044:1048>|easy<1049:1053>|pair<1076:1080>|apple<1086:1091>|apple home<1086:1096>|home<1092:1096>|first<1102:1107>|download<1132:1140>|firmware<1141:1149>|update<1150:1156>|firmware update<1141:1157>|update<1150:1157>|first<1158:1163>|system<1171:1177>|settings<1178:1186>|leviton<1194:1201>|leviton app<1194:1205>|the leviton app<1190:1205>|follow<1210:1216>|update<1221:1227>|prompt<1228:1235>|20 minute<1253:1263>|minute<1256:1263>|download<1267:1275>|firmware<1280:1288>|update<1289:1295>|update<1289:1296>|firmware update<1280:1296>|the firmware update<1276:1296>|once<1299:1303>|instal<1304:1313>|notice<1330:1336>|update<1343:1351>|matter<1359:1365>|matter protocol<1359:1374>|protocol<1366:1374>|accept<1389:1395>|update<1400:1406>|find<1426:1430>|matter<1436:1442>|pairing<1443:1450>|code<1451:1455>|device<1473:1479>|settings<1480:1488>|open<1506:1510>|home<1515:1519>|phone<1532:1537>|pair<1550:1554>|pair<1550:1557>|code<1558:1562>|qr<1566:1568>|code<1569:1573>|qr code<1566:1573>|add<1577:1580>|device<1585:1591>|apple<1595:1600>|apple home<1595:1605>|home<1601:1605>|same<1624:1628>|qr<1629:1631>|qr code<1629:1636>|code<1632:1636>|packaging<1657:1666>|siri<1680:1684>|control<1688:1695>|once<1707:1711>|add<1724:1727>|add<1724:1729>|home<1733:1737>",
      "Wireless and wired options for 3-way connections###wireless<0:8>|wire<13:18>|option<19:26>|3 way<31:36>|connection<37:48>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★★★ [2021-09-01] <b>Nice to see new models.  Looking forward to seeing how they perform.</b> I have many of the Gen 1 devices in my house.  Leviton has been my favorite brand for switches.  I also have tried Legrand and Aqara switches but always come back to Leviton as my fav.Pros:#1) 2.4GHz only:  I know a lot of people complain about this.  But I find this to be a benefit.  HomeKit does not need the bandwidth of 5GHz.  Most dual band mesh networks share a SSID and mine in particular (Orbi) cannot be separated.  My Gen 1 Decora Smart switches were constantly dropping with any WiFi interruption.  And these are the only HomeKit devices I have other than Apple TV and HomePods that are dual band devices.  I am looking forward to see how these new switches handle the same interruptions.#2) Self grounding:  The metal mounting flanges are self-grounding to metal switch boxes with grounded conduit.  This eliminates the need to use the ground wire.  I liked this about Gen 1 and am happy to see this also on the Gen 2.  Other brands use plastic mounting flanges that require the use of the ground wire.#3) It has both wireless and wired options for 3 way connections.  If you have a Gen 1 switch installed in a 3-way set up with a DD0SR coordinated remote this is a drop in replacement.  And now it gives you the option to use a wireless remote as well.Cons:#1) Setup:  The setup didn’t seem to go as smoothly as the Gen 1.  I attempted to add directly to Home App multiple times.  I reset the switch, restarted my phone, but could never “connect” to the switch when adding accessory.  I ended up having to add to the new Leviton app first, and then add to HomeKit via the Home app.  I also bought the new Gen 2 dimmer wall plug and had same experience.  I am not sure if it’s my system or the new device, but it wasn’t the experience I’m used to.#2) Wire Leads:  The Gen 1 had screw connections.  This is by far a better way to install IMO.  The leads and wire nuts take too much space.###new<15:18>|model<19:25>|forward<36:43>|perform<63:70>|gen<95:98>|device<101:107>|device<101:108>|house<115:120>|leviton<123:130>|favorite<143:151>|brand<152:157>|always<222:228>|back<234:238>|leviton<242:249>|now<286:289>|people<299:305>|lot of people<292:305>|complain<306:314>|find<334:338>|benefit<352:359>|home<362:366>|homekit<362:369>|band<388:392>|bandwidth<388:397>|most<408:412>|dual<413:417>|band<418:422>|mesh<423:427>|mesh network<423:436>|network<428:436>|share<437:442>|ssid<445:449>|particular<462:472>|orbi<474:478>|separate<490:499>|gen<505:508>|decora<511:517>|decora smart<511:523>|smart<518:523>|decora smart switch<511:532>|constantly<538:548>|drop<549:553>|drop<549:557>|wifi<567:571>|interruption<572:584>|home<610:614>|homekit<610:617>|device<618:624>|device<618:625>|apple<644:649>|tv<650:652>|home<657:661>|dual<675:679>|band<680:684>|device<685:691>|device<685:692>|forward<708:715>|new<733:736>|handle<746:752>|same<757:761>|interruption<762:774>|self<780:784>|ground<785:791>|ground<785:794>|metal<801:806>|mount<807:815>|flange<816:823>|self<828:832>|ground<833:839>|ground<833:842>|metal<846:851>|box<859:864>|ground<870:876>|ground<870:878>|eliminate<894:904>|ground<925:931>|ground wire<925:936>|wire<932:936>|gen<958:961>|happy<971:976>|gen<1001:1004>|brand<1015:1020>|brand<1015:1021>|other brand<1009:1021>|plastic<1026:1033>|mount<1034:1042>|flange<1043:1050>|require<1056:1063>|ground<1079:1085>|ground wire<1079:1090>|wire<1086:1090>|wire<1107:1111>|wireless<1107:1115>|wire<1120:1124>|wired<1120:1125>|option<1126:1132>|option<1126:1133>|3 way<1138:1143>|connect<1144:1151>|connection<1144:1155>|gen<1172:1175>|install<1185:1192>|instal<1185:1194>|3 way<1200:1205>|set<1206:1209>|remote<1238:1244>|drop<1255:1259>|replacement<1263:1274>|now<1281:1284>|give<1288:1293>|option<1302:1308>|wire<1318:1322>|wireless<1318:1326>|remote<1327:1333>|setup<1351:1356>|set<1363:1366>|setup<1363:1368>|smoothly<1390:1398>|gen<1406:1409>|attempt<1416:1425>|add<1429:1432>|directly<1433:1441>|home<1445:1449>|multiple<1454:1462>|multiple time<1454:1468>|reset<1473:1478>|set<1475:1478>|restart<1491:1500>|phone<1504:1509>|never<1521:1526>|connect<1528:1535>|add<1556:1559>|add<1556:1562>|accessory<1563:1572>|end<1577:1582>|add<1596:1599>|new<1607:1610>|leviton<1611:1618>|leviton app<1611:1622>|first<1623:1628>|add<1639:1642>|home<1646:1650>|homekit<1646:1653>|home<1662:1666>|new<1691:1694>|gen<1695:1698>|dimmer<1701:1707>|wall<1708:1712>|plug<1713:1717>|same<1726:1730>|experience<1731:1741>|system<1769:1775>|new<1783:1786>|device<1787:1793>|experience<1813:1823>|wire<1840:1844>|lead<1845:1850>|gen<1857:1860>|screw<1867:1872>|connect<1873:1880>|connection<1873:1884>|far<1898:1901>|install<1918:1925>|lead<1936:1941>|wire<1946:1950>|nut<1951:1955>|wire nut<1946:1955>|space<1970:1975>",

I've installed a couple of these dimmer switches. This is an awesome upgrade towards a smart home for $25 (or less). This product replaces the need for smart bulbs and a hub. I've installed this in a 3 gang box next to 3 way switches. It can be a little intimidating to mess with home wiring (I'm a mechanical engineer so I prefer to treat electricity as black magic), but once you figure out what wires you are looking at, it's not difficult. They supply leads on the ground and neutral with two wire nuts which makes it really easy to connect. The app walks you through the install.Bad: I wish that tp link was compatible with Apple HomeKit (like they promised when I initially started buying their smart home products).

I believe this is the new standard of things going forward and I am future proofing my installations by installing matter switches all around the house.We actually went through a hurricane about a year ago and we were without power for 10 days and after that we were without internet for another 30 days and probably more than that until it became reliable.  I like that these switches work without the necessity of Internet as it sometimes easier just to hit a button on the wall then to always speak on and off lights as you go through the house.I actually use this dimmer switch on a three-way outlet location and as long as you leave the remote side outlet turned on, the switch works perfectly fine.  I can't say whether that will work in your installation or not but it's definitely worth a shot.All in all the tp-link Kasa smart home dimmer is an excellent switch that can be programmed and set to dim at certain levels, turn on and off at certain times, and works very reliably with just about ecosystem out there thanks to the Matter cross platform compatibility standard.  I definitely love and definitely recommend Kasa devices as the most reliable and simplest smart home device you can install!  💡###wi<13:15>|wi fi<13:18>|fi<16:18>|dim<19:22>|dimmer<19:25>|now<40:43>|support<44:51>|support<44:52>|matter<53:59>|device<86:92>|device<86:93>|all<103:106>|kasa<107:111>|smart<112:117>|device<118:124>|device<118:125>|kasa smart device<107:125>|all<134:137>|actually<130:138>|kasa<149:153>|smart<154:159>|dim<160:163>|dimmer<160:166>|kasa smart dimmer<149:167>|dimmer<160:167>|smart dimmer<154:167>|already<168:175>|install<176:183>|all<180:183>|instal<176:185>|house<197:202>|a couple<242:250>|couple<244:250>|other brand<251:263>|brand<257:263>|family<278:284>|parent<292:299>|all<303:306>|kasa<312:316>|smart<317:322>|home<323:327>|smart home<317:327>|smart home device<317:334>|device<328:334>|device<328:335>|smart home device<317:335>|smart<354:359>|home<360:364>|home<360:365>|smart home<354:365>|reliably<378:386>|timer<407:413>|set<414:417>|turn<424:428>|certain<455:462>|certain time<455:468>|wi<494:496>|wi fi<494:499>|a wi fi<492:499>|fi<497:499>|outage<500:506>|forward<520:527>|matter<541:547>|technology<548:558>|smart<567:572>|all<586:589>|allow<586:592>|turn<599:603>|device<619:625>|device<619:626>|future<636:642>|device<643:649>|device<643:650>|support<656:663>|matter<664:670>|believe<675:682>|new<695:698>|standard<699:707>|forward<724:731>|future<741:747>|proof<748:756>|all<764:767>|install<760:767>|installation<760:772>|installation<760:773>|all<781:784>|install<777:784>|instal<777:787>|matter<788:794>|all<804:807>|house<819:824>|all<832:835>|actually<828:836>|year<870:874>|ago<875:878>|power<899:904>|day<912:916>|internet<948:956>|day<972:976>|30 day<969:976>|probably<981:989>|become<1014:1020>|reliable<1021:1029>|internet<1089:1097>|sometimes<1104:1113>|hit<1129:1132>|button<1135:1141>|wall<1149:1153>|all<1150:1153>|always<1162:1168>|speak<1169:1174>|house<1215:1220>|all<1227:1230>|actually<1223:1231>|dim<1241:1244>|dimmer<1241:1247>|three way<1260:1269>|outlet<1270:1276>|location<1277:1285>|long<1293:1297>|leave<1305:1310>|remote<1315:1321>|side<1322:1326>|outlet<1327:1333>|turn<1334:1338>|turn<1334:1340>|perfectly<1362:1371>|all<1426:1429>|install<1422:1429>|installation<1422:1434>|definitely<1451:1461>|worth<1462:1467>|all<1475:1478>|all<1482:1485>|tp<1490:1492>|link<1493:1497>|tp link<1490:1497>|the tp link<1486:1497>|kasa<1498:1502>|link kasa<1493:1502>|tp link kasa<1490:1502>|smart<1503:1508>|smart home<1503:1513>|home<1509:1513>|dim<1514:1517>|dimmer<1514:1520>|program<1556:1566>|set<1571:1574>|dim<1578:1581>|certain<1585:1592>|level<1593:1599>|turn<1601:1605>|certain<1620:1627>|certain time<1620:1633>|reliably<1650:1658>|ecosystem<1675:1684>|thank<1695:1701>|matter<1709:1715>|platform<1722:1730>|compatibility<1731:1744>|standard<1745:1753>|definitely<1758:1768>|love<1769:1773>|definitely<1778:1788>|recommend<1789:1798>|kasa<1799:1803>|device<1804:1810>|device<1804:1811>|most<1819:1823>|reliable<1824:1832>|simple<1837:1845>|smart<1846:1851>|home<1852:1856>|smart home<1846:1856>|device<1857:1863>|smart home device<1846:1863>|install<1872:1879>|all<1876:1879>",

The wifi connection is fine, the whole network has internet and runs very quickly (have 2.5gb internet) and there are no problems anywhere else. It just just the voice dimmers, they all lose connection quite a lot. So throughout the house you hear these little beeps randomly to signal connection lost or restored. Pretty annoying when this is the only device having an issue. It isn't even the dimmer itself, as I can still control that with very good response time from the My Leviton app or from Google Home. ONLY the Alexa connection gets lost constantly.The other big gripe is you cannot change the wake word from Alexa. You'd think after a couple years of firmware updates now that they would make the other options that Echo devices have available.Save your money and don't get these voice dimmers. The loss of Alexa throughout the day and the annoying beeps around the house makes these not worth it. The other switch and dimmer products (2nd gen) seem to work great 99% of the time though.###change<10:16>|wake<17:21>|word<22:26>|wake word<17:26>|alexa<28:33>|lose<34:38>|lose<34:39>|connection<40:50>|instal<76:85>|week<94:98>|now<99:102>|alexa<125:130>|connection<138:148>|lose<154:158>|day<171:174>|day<181:184>|wifi<190:194>|wifi connection<190:205>|connection<195:205>|whole<219:224>|network<225:232>|internet<237:245>|run<250:254>|quickly<260:267>|internet<280:288>|problem<307:315>|no problem<304:315>|anywhere<316:324>|voice<348:353>|dimmer<354:360>|dimmer<354:361>|lose<372:376>|connection<377:387>|house<419:424>|hear<429:433>|randomly<453:461>|signal<465:471>|connection<472:482>|lose<483:487>|restore<491:499>|pretty<501:507>|annoying<508:516>|device<539:545>|issue<556:561>|an issue<553:561>|dimmer<581:587>|still<605:610>|control<611:618>|response<639:647>|response time<639:652>|leviton<665:672>|leviton app<665:676>|google<685:691>|google home<685:696>|home<692:696>|alexa<707:712>|connection<713:723>|lose<729:733>|constantly<734:744>|big<755:758>|gripe<759:764>|change<779:785>|wake<790:794>|word<795:799>|wake word<790:799>|alexa<805:810>|a couple<830:838>|couple<832:838>|year<839:844>|firmware<848:856>|update<857:864>|firmware update<848:864>|now<865:868>|option<900:907>|echo<913:917>|device<918:924>|echo device<913:925>|device<918:925>|available<931:940>|save<941:945>|money<951:956>|voice<977:982>|dimmer<983:989>|dimmer<983:990>|loss<996:1000>|alexa<1004:1009>|day<1025:1028>|annoying<1037:1045>|house<1063:1068>|worth<1085:1090>|dimmer<1116:1122>|2nd<1133:1136>|2nd gen<1133:1140>|gen<1137:1140>|though<1177:1183>",

Really hoping I don’t have to.###love<77:81>|easy<86:90>|all<107:110>|install<103:110>|alexa<131:136>|easy<146:150>|mobile<176:182>|mobile app<176:186>|however<187:194>|replace<210:217>|less<238:242>|month<251:257>|stop<268:272>|mean<298:305>|turn<312:316>|all<342:345>|manually<338:346>|long<360:366>|connect<372:379>|wifi<383:387>|connect<399:406>|disconnect<396:408>|completely<414:424>|install<428:435>|all<432:435>|reinstall<426:437>|reset<443:448>|factory<452:459>|setting<460:468>|help<477:481>|dead<493:497>|expensive<535:544>|replace<548:555>|often<561:566>|all<577:580>|now<589:592>|stop<606:610>|again<611:616>|replace<623:632>|regular<645:652>|a regular switch<643:659>|all<663:666>|hope<668:674>",

Works awesome! Did not take long at all to install, but keep in mind unlike some of the other competitor products you WILL need a neutral wire to install this unit to code. I love how I can create scenes with the KASA app in conjunction with a few other switches in the home with the push of a single button on the app, and create custom shortcuts with lighting by double-clicking or long-holding the light switch. Also, If I am away on travel, I can set an automatic timer to turn on and off the KASA switch(es) remotely using an 'away' mode to visually appear that someone is living in the home. However, keep in mind that this is a WIFI switch, so you might see problems with WIFI connectivity if you add a bunch of these into your home network (your router could start dropping connections because it is connected to too many devices). But if you are just going to use a handful few of these, this solution is cheaper than competitors and works great. I have about 6 of these in the home, and love it.

      "Uses WiFi###wifi<5:9>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2023-01-02] <b>Great, easy to install, and reliable</b> Hello!I've had these for several years and they are great. Installation is as easy as installing a regular switch and look fantastic.TP-Link also has models with 3-way switches for stairs, hallways or any other place where you have 2 switches for the same light. There's also this model with motion and light sensors that works well: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NMX9N24.Setup is easy. You can make these work with Alexa if you have that. I personally have a hub server from Home Assistant and use Alexa that way but the end result is the same: \"Alexa, lights on\" or \"Alexa, kitchen lights on\" before you even get there.To set it up, and not to add yet-another-app to my phone, I installed the TP-Link/Kasa app on my Fire tablet. Install the switch and make sure you can turn the lights on and off with it. Launch the Kasa app, place your Fire/phone near the switch, and follow the directions.Because the app assumes you have a cellphone connection at all times - and that's not available with a Fire tablet - you might see a temporary connection error during the setup. You can safely ignore this. Your tablet will reconnect to your home WiFi a second later and all will be well. I have more than a dozen of these switches installed using my Amazon Fire tablet and it works.Of course, you will need a WiFi router for these. The WiFi range on these is good but since you want 100% reliable operation with a light switch, your router should be nearby, preferably near the center of your home.Once you get one of these working, I guarantee you will buy more. Ask me how I know lol.###easy<10:14>|install<18:25>|reliable<31:39>|year<77:82>|several year<69:82>|install<103:110>|installation<103:115>|easy<122:126>|install<130:137>|instal<130:140>|regular<143:150>|a regular switch<141:157>|tp<177:179>|link<180:184>|tp link<177:184>|model<194:199>|model<194:200>|3 way<206:211>|3 way switch<206:220>|stair<225:231>|hallway<233:241>|place<255:260>|same<295:299>|model<325:330>|motion<336:342>|sensor<353:360>|easy<424:428>|alexa<459:464>|work with alexa<449:464>|personally<485:495>|hub<503:506>|server<507:513>|home<519:523>|assistant<524:533>|home assistant<519:533>|alexa<542:547>|end<565:568>|result<569:575>|same<583:587>|alexa<590:595>|alexa<612:617>|kitchen<619:626>|kitchen light<619:633>|set<667:670>|add<689:692>|yet<693:696>|phone<715:720>|install<724:731>|instal<724:733>|tp<738:740>|tp link<738:745>|the tp link<734:745>|link<741:745>|link kasa<741:750>|kasa<746:750>|tp link kasa<738:750>|kasa app<746:754>|fire<761:765>|tablet<766:772>|fire tablet<761:772>|install<774:781>|turn<815:819>|kasa<862:866>|the kasa app<858:870>|kasa app<862:870>|place<872:877>|fire<883:887>|phone<888:893>|follow<915:921>|direction<926:936>|assume<953:960>|phone<976:981>|connection<982:992>|available<1023:1032>|fire<1040:1044>|fire tablet<1040:1051>|tablet<1045:1051>|connection<1080:1090>|error<1091:1096>|set<1108:1111>|setup<1108:1113>|ignore<1130:1136>|tablet<1148:1154>|reconnect<1160:1169>|home<1178:1182>|wifi<1183:1187>|second<1190:1196>|later<1197:1202>|dozen<1244:1249>|a dozen<1242:1249>|install<1268:1275>|instal<1268:1277>|fire<1294:1298>|tablet<1299:1305>|fire tablet<1294:1305>|course<1322:1328>|wifi<1346:1350>|router<1351:1357>|wifi<1373:1377>|range<1378:1383>|reliable<1425:1433>|operation<1434:1443>|router<1470:1476>|center<1515:1521>|home<1530:1534>|ask<1601:1604>",

I purchased them because my Wemo devices were becoming unreliable and hadn't had a firmware update in years (despite me checking). I also wanted to support an American company, Leviton. (Although I can't say for sure where the devices were manufactured) These Leviton devices are extremely reliable with my commercial Wi-Fi setup. I immediately upgraded the stock firmware to the Matter version. In 6 months there have been three firmware updates, which I consider to be excellent. The Matter connectivity works great through my AppleTV, iPhones, iPads, and through the Leviton app. I generally use the Home app on my iPhone. The only hiccup was I did have to re-enroll them once due to an Apple update, but thankfully the process was painless. Please note that once you update to the Matter firmware, the pairing code on the back/side will no longer be valid. You will need to note the new Matter pairing code after the update, or you can look it up in the Leviton app.###support<3:11>|matter<12:18>|support matter<3:18>|re<26:28>|reliable<26:34>|exceed<41:49>|expectation<53:65>|re<79:81>|device<92:99>|home<106:110>|wemo<140:144>|device<145:152>|re<155:157>|become<158:166>|re<169:171>|reliable<169:177>|unreliable<167:177>|firmware<195:203>|re<201:203>|firmware update<195:210>|a firmware update<193:210>|update<204:210>|year<214:219>|check<232:240>|support<260:267>|american<271:279>|company<280:287>|leviton<289:296>|re<326:328>|re<332:334>|device<339:346>|re<349:351>|re<361:363>|manufacture<352:364>|leviton<372:379>|device<380:387>|re<389:391>|re<395:397>|extremely<392:401>|re<402:404>|reliable<402:410>|wi<430:432>|fi<433:435>|setup<436:441>|immediately<445:456>|upgrade<457:465>|firmware<476:484>|re<482:484>|matter<492:498>|version<499:506>|6 month<511:519>|month<513:519>|re<523:525>|re<538:540>|firmware<542:550>|re<548:550>|firmware update<542:557>|update<551:557>|firmware update<542:558>|update<551:558>|side<571:575>|consider<568:576>|matter<598:604>|connectivity<605:617>|re<625:627>|apple<641:646>|iphone<650:656>|leviton<682:689>|leviton app<682:693>|the leviton app<678:693>|generally<697:706>|home<715:719>|iphone<730:736>|re<772:774>|enroll<775:781>|once<787:791>|due<792:795>|apple<802:807>|an apple<799:807>|update<808:814>|thankfully<820:830>|process<835:842>|note<864:868>|once<874:878>|update<883:889>|matter<897:903>|re<910:912>|matter firmware<897:912>|firmware<904:912>|the matter firmware<893:912>|pair<918:925>|code<926:930>|back<938:942>|side<943:947>|long<956:962>|note<990:994>|new<999:1002>|matter<1003:1009>|pair<1010:1017>|code<1018:1022>|update<1033:1039>|leviton<1070:1077>|the leviton app<1066:1081>|leviton app<1070:1081>",
      "Uses WiFi###wifi<5:9>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2023-10-08] <b>Finally, a cost-effective dimmable light switch to replace old X-10 controls</b> I have been using X-10 dimmers for years, waiting for someone to finally make a WIFI switch with dimming capability at an affordable price.  When the Kasa products became available I decided to give them a try.Being new at this, at first I did not clearly understand the well thought out Kasa instructions.  I thought I was supposed to connect the dimmer to my HOME wifi.  I finally understood that the process is to first connect the Kasa app on my smart phone to the TP-LINK wifi, and THEN, once this connection is established, connect the app to my home wifi.  Once I understood this, the rest of the setup process for the first dimmer was extremely easy and well thought out.  Setting up the second and third dimmers I purchased went very quickly.I also like the great flexibility in the app.  When setting up timers to dim the three sets of lights, the process allows you to choose one of several dimming settings (e. g., 20% of regular brightness).  I did so, but found the brightness at the lowest preset was still too high.  To my great satisfaction, it is easy in the app to change the value of each preset, enabling me to achieve the dimming level I needed.As for the smart mini-switches, what a great price when purchasing a pair!  And, they install just as easily as the smart dimmers.  And, I like the ability in the app to label each installed device as to its location and what it controls.Nice job, TP-Link!###finally<3:10>|cost<14:18>|effective<19:28>|dim<29:32>|dimmable<29:37>|replace<54:61>|old<62:65>|control<71:79>|dim<107:110>|dimmer<107:113>|dimmer<107:114>|year<119:124>|wait<126:133>|finally<149:156>|wifi<164:168>|dim<181:184>|dim<181:188>|ability<192:199>|capability<189:199>|affordable<206:216>|price<217:222>|kasa<234:238>|become<248:254>|available<255:264>|decide<267:274>|give<278:282>|new<300:303>|first<316:321>|clearly<332:339>|understand<340:350>|kasa<372:376>|instruction<377:389>|suppose<408:416>|connect<420:427>|dim<432:435>|dimmer<432:438>|home<445:449>|wifi<450:454>|finally<459:466>|understand<467:477>|process<487:494>|first<501:506>|connect<507:514>|kasa<519:523>|kasa app<519:527>|the kasa app<515:527>|smart<534:539>|phone<540:545>|tp<553:555>|the tp link<549:560>|tp link<553:560>|link<556:560>|wifi<561:565>|tp link wifi<553:565>|connect<587:594>|connection<587:597>|connect<614:621>|home<636:640>|wifi<641:645>|understand<655:665>|the rest<672:680>|rest<676:680>|setup<688:693>|process<694:701>|setup process<688:701>|first<710:715>|dim<716:719>|dimmer<716:722>|extremely<727:736>|easy<737:741>|set<765:772>|second<780:786>|third<791:796>|dim<797:800>|dimmer<797:803>|dimmer<797:804>|quickly<827:834>|flexibility<857:868>|set<887:894>|timer<898:904>|dim<908:911>|set<922:926>|process<942:949>|allow<950:956>|choose<964:970>|dim<986:989>|dim<986:993>|set<994:1001>|setting<994:1002>|regular<1018:1025>|brightness<1026:1036>|find<1054:1059>|brightness<1064:1074>|low<1082:1088>|preset<1089:1095>|still<1100:1105>|high<1110:1114>|easy<1149:1153>|change<1168:1174>|value<1179:1184>|preset<1193:1199>|enable<1201:1209>|dim<1228:1231>|dim<1228:1235>|level<1236:1241>|smart<1262:1267>|mini<1268:1272>|price<1296:1301>|great price<1290:1301>|a great price<1288:1301>|pair<1320:1324>|install<1337:1344>|easily<1353:1359>|smart<1367:1372>|dim<1373:1376>|dimmer<1373:1379>|dimmer<1373:1380>|smart dimmer<1367:1380>|ability<1399:1406>|label<1421:1426>|install<1432:1439>|instal<1432:1441>|device<1442:1448>|location<1459:1467>|control<1480:1488>|job<1494:1497>|tp<1499:1501>|tp link<1499:1506>|link<1502:1506>",

The great things is that each one connects to WiFi individually and there is not need for a central hub.  However, for the dimmer switch (HS220), there is no three way switch available, which means if your family or living room has more than one switch controlling it, you cannot use a dimmer switch, as far as I know. The dimmers HS220 can only be used in our bedrooms which only have one switch, since it only functions as single pole.  The only 3 way switch (which means two light switches controlling the same light) is the HS210, and that does not have a dimming feature on it. (BTW, two-way switch means one switch controls the light, and three-way switch means two switches control the light - had to learn this!). This is the latest; I inquired on their website today and their automated response was:  \"HS220 is a dimmer switch but it's only a two-way switch.

I purchased them because my Wemo devices were becoming unreliable and hadn't had a firmware update in years (despite me checking). I also wanted to support an American company, Leviton. (Although I can't say for sure where the devices were manufactured) These Leviton devices are extremely reliable with my commercial Wi-Fi setup. I immediately upgraded the stock firmware to the Matter version. In 6 months there have been three firmware updates, which I consider to be excellent. The Matter connectivity works great through my AppleTV, iPhones, iPads, and through the Leviton app. I generally use the Home app on my iPhone. The only hiccup was I did have to re-enroll them once due to an Apple update, but thankfully the process was painless. Please note that once you update to the Matter firmware, the pairing code on the back/side will no longer be valid. You will need to note the new Matter pairing code after the update, or you can look it up in the Leviton app.###support<3:11>|matter<12:18>|support matter<3:18>|re<26:28>|reliable<26:34>|exceed<41:49>|expectation<53:65>|re<79:81>|device<92:99>|home<106:110>|wemo<140:144>|device<145:152>|re<155:157>|become<158:166>|re<169:171>|reliable<169:177>|unreliable<167:177>|firmware<195:203>|re<201:203>|firmware update<195:210>|a firmware update<193:210>|update<204:210>|year<214:219>|check<232:240>|support<260:267>|american<271:279>|company<280:287>|leviton<289:296>|re<326:328>|re<332:334>|device<339:346>|re<349:351>|re<361:363>|manufacture<352:364>|leviton<372:379>|device<380:387>|re<389:391>|re<395:397>|extremely<392:401>|re<402:404>|reliable<402:410>|wi<430:432>|fi<433:435>|setup<436:441>|immediately<445:456>|upgrade<457:465>|firmware<476:484>|re<482:484>|matter<492:498>|version<499:506>|6 month<511:519>|month<513:519>|re<523:525>|re<538:540>|firmware<542:550>|re<548:550>|firmware update<542:557>|update<551:557>|firmware update<542:558>|update<551:558>|side<571:575>|consider<568:576>|matter<598:604>|connectivity<605:617>|re<625:627>|apple<641:646>|iphone<650:656>|leviton<682:689>|leviton app<682:693>|the leviton app<678:693>|generally<697:706>|home<715:719>|iphone<730:736>|re<772:774>|enroll<775:781>|once<787:791>|due<792:795>|apple<802:807>|an apple<799:807>|update<808:814>|thankfully<820:830>|process<835:842>|note<864:868>|once<874:878>|update<883:889>|matter<897:903>|re<910:912>|matter firmware<897:912>|firmware<904:912>|the matter firmware<893:912>|pair<918:925>|code<926:930>|back<938:942>|side<943:947>|long<956:962>|note<990:994>|new<999:1002>|matter<1003:1009>|pair<1010:1017>|code<1018:1022>|update<1033:1039>|leviton<1070:1077>|the leviton app<1066:1081>|leviton app<1070:1081>",

I use them with Feit recessed LEDs and the TP-Link Deco M9 router.Pros:- They are a notable brand for what that is worth- They are very affordable relative to other name brand switches or going Z-Wave or Zigbee- Easy to install- They work relatively well with Feit bulbs which I have found to be very finicky.  They still don’t work perfectly and the bulbs still do still flicker a little at specific dimmer levels; but still better than other dimmer switches I have tried.- After rebooting my router, I have no issues with reconnections- Great integration with Home Assistant and Samsung SmartThings and can be cycled without an internet connectionCons:- No three-way option yet and you can only group up to 3 sets of switches in the Kaza app to mimic this function.  The workaround for this is to use Samsung SmartThings app which has equal if not better response time than Kasa’s native app.  I use the HS200 and HS220 with SmartThings to mimic a three way dimmer configuration.  In reality the HS220 controls the lights and the HS200 is powered but not connected to any lights directly.  The downside to this configuration is only the dimmer switch works manually without internet.  Response time between the switches is about 1 to 2 seconds using SmartThings or the Kasa app- I have had to reset one of my 23 devices in the past 6 months; however, that was as simple as pressing the reset button which just power cycles it, all setting are still saved- The dimmers have had a weird behavior that has happened twice where you turn them off, the switch will register as off including the indicator light on the switch itself, but the lights will still be on.  You have to press the switch again to “turn the light on” and then off again.  Again this has happened two times over several hundred cycles.###mostly<3:9>|currently<22:31>|dimmer<48:54>|these dimmer switch<42:63>|instal<64:73>|personally<78:88>|dimmer<112:118>|option<119:125>|feit<144:148>|recess<149:157>|led<158:162>|tp<171:173>|link<174:178>|the tp link<167:178>|tp link<171:178>|deco<179:183>|router<187:193>|brand<220:225>|affordable<264:274>|name<293:297>|name brand<293:303>|brand<298:303>|z wave<322:328>|wave<324:328>|easy<340:344>|relatively<367:377>|feit<388:392>|bulb<393:398>|feit bulb<388:398>|find<412:417>|still<444:449>|perfectly<461:470>|bulb<479:484>|still<485:490>|still<494:499>|flicker<500:507>|specific<520:528>|dimmer<529:535>|level<536:542>|still<548:553>|dimmer<572:578>|reboot<609:618>|router<622:628>|issue<640:646>|no issue<637:646>|integration<673:684>|home<690:694>|assistant<695:704>|home assistant<690:704>|samsung<709:716>|samsung smartthings<709:728>|smartthings<717:728>|cycle<740:746>|internet<758:766>|three way<787:796>|option<797:803>|yet<804:807>|group<825:830>|set<839:843>|function<886:894>|workaround<901:911>|samsung<931:938>|samsung smartthings<931:950>|smartthings<939:950>|response<985:993>|response time<985:998>|kasa<1004:1008>|native<1011:1017>|native app<1011:1021>|smartthings<1055:1066>|three way<1078:1087>|dimmer<1088:1094>|configuration<1095:1108>|control<1132:1140>|power<1169:1174>|connect<1185:1194>|directly<1209:1217>|downside<1224:1232>|configuration<1241:1254>|dimmer<1267:1273>|manually<1287:1295>|internet<1304:1312>|response<1315:1323>|response time<1315:1328>|2 second<1364:1373>|second<1366:1373>|smartthings<1380:1391>|kasa<1399:1403>|reset<1423:1428>|device<1442:1449>|past<1457:1461>|6 month<1462:1470>|month<1464:1470>|however<1472:1479>|simple<1493:1499>|press<1503:1508>|press<1503:1511>|reset<1516:1521>|button<1522:1528>|the reset button<1512:1528>|reset button<1516:1528>|power<1540:1545>|cycle<1546:1552>|setting<1561:1568>|still<1573:1578>|dimmer<1590:1596>|dimmer<1590:1597>|weird<1609:1614>|behavior<1615:1623>|happen<1633:1641>|twice<1642:1647>|turn<1658:1662>|register<1689:1697>|include<1705:1714>|indicator<1719:1728>|indicator light<1719:1734>|still<1777:1782>|press<1803:1808>|again<1820:1825>|turn<1830:1834>|again<1862:1867>|again<1870:1875>|happen<1885:1893>|cycle<1925:1931>",
      "Uses Matter protocol###matter<5:11>|protocol<12:20>|matter protocol<5:20>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2024-05-11] <b>Kasa... is just a great line of products by TPLINK (plays well with TAPO devices too)</b> This... just works. I have used smart devices from at least five different manufacturers in my home over the last 4 years. Meaning, I have used smart plugs, light switches, outlets, water sensors, human presence sensors, USB power switches, and dimming control devices from five different manufacturers. And presently I'm down to two only. Without question, Kasa is my favorite. I now have probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 or 9 switches that are Kasa. I sincerely can't recommend them high enough - particularly if you are already familiar with the process of how to wire and connect smart devices.If you've never done anything like this before and are not technically savvy and willing to troubleshoot and problem solve on your own go find a neighbor or a friend who have done this sort of thing before to help you and you'll get it working without trouble.Why am I down to two manufactures? Because all the others have failed over time. In particular, virtually every single plug I have had of one particular brand I will not mention, all failed within 18 months. I had put a fairly significant investment in those switches and that was pretty irritating particularly when I'm past the warranty period. I do want to mention that in my recommendation of these switches, I was fortunate to get my very first Kasa switch as a member of the vine community at least two years ago. It's because of that experience that I have purchased many others with my own hard earned money - and was happy to pick up this one. Virtually every single switch I have from Kasa is still going strong and haven't given me any connectivity or dependability issues.Now, when it comes to this particular switch - it is different in one aspect than all the others I have. This one uses the Matter protocol which I suppose for some people would be highly beneficial. Frankly because I'm so familiar with how to use the standard ones, and actually don't mind using the App I didn't need this. But understand the reasoning and the push behind Matter. What I don't like, is how (in particular) my Samsung smartphone simply wanted to co-opt this device before I hardly had a chance to transition it into my home automation system of choice which is actually Google. Not that Google's home control is necessarily all that much better than others simply because I now have become very comfortable with it and connected so many devices to it.With Matter, it makes it easy to connect directly to your home control a of choice and I understand it particularly is designed to work directly with Alexa, google, Apple's home kit, and of course Samsung's smart things.If you didn't know, as it says in my title Kasa and Tapo are both smart devices of various kinds made by the company TPLink. I really quite like my mesh router by TPLink and have used other devices of theirs for many years probably going back at least 10 years and consider their products generally well done. Tapo and Kasa now play well together in a single app and I know this because I have two very nice Tapo WiFi cameras.If you're looking to get into some kind of a smart home automation system, and in particular if you are a bit of a home handyman, I think this is where you should start! Everything I have used of Kasa (and Tapo) have worked great.

      "Supports 2.4Ghz WiFi only###support<0:8>|wifi<16:20>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★☆☆☆ [2025-02-23] <b>Significant downgrade from the Gen 1 switches, removed support for 5Ghz WiFi</b> I already have multiple Leviton smart switches installed in my home as well as some installed in my parents house.  I have been very happy with these switches and have recommended them to multiple people over the years.I wanted to replace another switch in my home with a smart switch and honestly did not even consider any other brand besides Leviton.  I did however decided to get one of the newer 2nd generation switches that (supposedly) supports Matter, figuring it would be more future proof.For starters, the installation wasn't terrible, but wasn't any easier than the Gen 1 switches I have installed before.  Was hoping that the body of the switch would have shrunk a bit making for easier installation in tight switch boxes in our older home.After I got the install done I had a TERRIBLE time getting the switch trim plate on.  The trim plate is two pieces, the first piece (let's call it the base) is screwed onto the switch and the second snaps onto the first.  Well the screws that are provided to attach the base to the switch are very short.  This would not be such a big problem except that the holes don't line up well.  Eventually after much frustration I was able to get it on by backing the screws that held the switch in place but even then it doesn't feel secure.  I sure hope I can use a standard decora trim plate on this switch because I think I'm going to need to replace it.2nd problem was when I went to configure it, I already had the My Leviton app installed on my phone to support my existing switches.  I was able to connect the app to the new switch but was not able to see or select the network I wanted.  After more frustration I discovered that inexplicably Leviton decided to REMOVE support for 5Ghz WiFi networks.  I know that 2.4Ghz only WiFi chips are slightly cheaper than ones that support both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz but this level of feature cutting is a very bad sign.Honestly the primary reason I selected Leviton switches over TP-Link or others was the support for 5Ghz WiFi.  Leviton has deleted their sole competitive advantage over other, less expensive smart switches.Finally, as for the supposed Matter support.  I will admit I don't know a lot about Matter but I did try to use Matter to add it to my Google Home (instead of using the linked connection to the My Leviton app) but was unable to.  Google wanted me to scan a QR code on the box but the only QR coded on the box or in the manuals did not work and neither the box nor the manual said anything at all about Matter support.  So who knows if this device even supports Matter like the listing says it does, in any case I could not get it to work.Honestly, if it wouldn't have been such a PITA to rip this switch out of the wall and return it I would have.I did give 2* instead of 1 because it _does_ work.  I was able to get it connected to my Google Home via the link to My Leviton and am able to control it but it's fallen FAR short of my expectations.###significant<3:14>|downgrade<15:24>|gen<34:37>|remove<50:57>|support<58:65>|wifi<75:79>|already<86:93>|multiple<99:107>|leviton<108:115>|smart<116:121>|leviton smart switch<108:130>|all<135:138>|install<131:138>|instal<131:140>|home<147:151>|install<168:175>|all<172:175>|instal<168:177>|parent<184:191>|house<192:197>|happy<217:222>|recommend<252:263>|multiple<272:280>|people<281:287>|year<297:302>|replace<315:322>|place<317:322>|home<344:348>|smart<356:361>|one<374:377>|one<374:378>|honestly<373:381>|consider<395:403>|other brand<408:419>|brand<414:419>|leviton<428:435>|however<444:451>|decide<452:459>|one<467:470>|new<478:481>|new<478:483>|2nd<484:487>|generation<488:498>|2nd generation<484:498>|suppose<514:522>|support<526:533>|support<526:534>|matter<535:541>|figure<543:551>|future<569:575>|future proof<569:581>|proof<576:581>|all<604:607>|install<600:607>|installation<600:612>|easy<645:651>|gen<661:664>|all<687:690>|install<683:690>|instal<683:692>|hope<706:712>|body<722:726>|easy<776:782>|install<783:790>|all<787:790>|installation<783:795>|easy installation<776:795>|tight<799:804>|box<812:815>|box<812:817>|old<825:830>|old home<825:835>|home<831:835>|install<852:859>|all<856:859>|one<861:864>|trim<906:910>|trim plate<906:916>|plate<911:916>|trim<926:930>|plate<931:936>|trim plate<926:936>|piece<944:949>|piece<944:950>|first<956:961>|piece<962:967>|let<969:972>|all<976:979>|call<975:979>|base<987:991>|screw<996:1003>|second<1028:1034>|snap<1035:1040>|first<1050:1055>|screw<1067:1073>|provide<1083:1091>|attach<1095:1101>|base<1106:1110>|short<1134:1139>|big<1167:1170>|problem<1171:1178>|hole<1195:1200>|line<1207:1211>|all<1228:1231>|eventually<1222:1232>|frustration<1244:1255>|able<1262:1266>|back<1283:1290>|screw<1295:1301>|hold<1307:1311>|place<1326:1331>|feel<1357:1361>|secure<1362:1368>|hope<1378:1382>|standard<1395:1403>|decora<1404:1410>|standard decora<1395:1410>|trim<1411:1415>|trim plate<1411:1421>|plate<1416:1421>|replace<1474:1481>|place<1476:1481>|2nd<1485:1488>|problem<1489:1496>|configure<1516:1525>|already<1532:1539>|leviton<1551:1558>|leviton app<1551:1562>|all<1567:1570>|install<1563:1570>|instal<1563:1572>|one<1581:1584>|phone<1579:1584>|support<1588:1595>|exist<1599:1607>|able<1625:1629>|connect<1633:1640>|new<1656:1659>|able<1679:1683>|select<1694:1700>|network<1705:1712>|frustration<1735:1746>|discover<1749:1759>|leviton<1778:1785>|decide<1786:1793>|remove<1797:1803>|support<1804:1811>|wifi<1821:1825>|network<1826:1833>|wifi network<1821:1834>|network<1826:1834>|wifi<1861:1865>|slightly<1876:1884>|cheap<1885:1892>|one<1898:1901>|one<1898:1902>|support<1908:1915>|level<1946:1951>|feature<1955:1962>|sign<1985:1989>|one<1991:1994>|one<1991:1995>|honestly<1990:1998>|primary<2003:2010>|reason<2011:2017>|select<2020:2026>|select<2020:2028>|leviton<2029:2036>|tp<2051:2053>|link<2054:2058>|tp link<2051:2058>|support<2077:2084>|wifi<2094:2098>|leviton<2101:2108>|let<2115:2118>|delete<2113:2120>|less<2166:2170>|expensive<2171:2180>|smart<2181:2186>|all<2199:2202>|finally<2196:2203>|suppose<2216:2224>|matter<2225:2231>|support<2232:2239>|matter support<2225:2239>|admit<2249:2254>|matter<2280:2286>|matter<2308:2314>|add<2318:2321>|google<2331:2337>|home<2338:2342>|google home<2331:2342>|instead<2344:2351>|link<2365:2369>|link<2365:2371>|connect<2372:2379>|connection<2372:2382>|leviton<2393:2400>|leviton app<2393:2404>|unable<2414:2420>|able<2416:2420>|google<2426:2432>|scan<2446:2450>|qr<2453:2455>|a qr code<2451:2460>|qr code<2453:2460>|code<2456:2460>|box<2468:2471>|qr<2485:2487>|qr code<2485:2492>|code<2488:2492>|code<2488:2493>|qr code<2485:2493>|box<2501:2504>|manual<2515:2521>|manual<2515:2522>|box<2552:2555>|manual<2564:2570>|all<2588:2591>|matter<2598:2604>|support<2605:2612>|matter support<2598:2612>|device<2636:2642>|support<2648:2655>|support<2648:2656>|matter<2657:2663>|listing<2673:2680>|case<2702:2706>|one<2735:2738>|one<2735:2739>|honestly<2734:2742>|rip<2784:2787>|all<2812:2815>|wall<2811:2815>|return<2820:2826>|give<2849:2853>|instead<2857:2864>|able<2901:2905>|connect<2916:2923>|connect<2916:2925>|google<2932:2938>|home<2939:2943>|google home<2932:2943>|link<2952:2956>|leviton<2963:2970>|able<2978:2982>|control<2986:2993>|all<3007:3010>|fall<3006:3012>|far<3013:3016>|short<3017:3022>|expectation<3029:3041>",

Setup was straightforward, but my experience took a drastic turn when I attempted to add the switch to HomeKit using Matter.Firstly, this switch does not support Matter out of the box. You are required to enroll in a beta program and install beta firmware on the switch to enable Matter functionality. Even after doing so, I encountered persistent issues. Despite numerous attempts to connect, including resetting the device, restarting my router and phone, and trying every troubleshooting step I could find, the switch simply would not pair with HomeKit via Matter.After some research, I discovered forum posts suggesting that Matter requires a 2.4GHz-only Wi-Fi network. I have a Google Nest Wi-Fi Pro router, which doesn’t allow disabling specific Wi-Fi bands. It's worth noting that I have several other Matter-enabled devices from different brands that connected seamlessly without needing to adjust any network settings.I even exchanged the switch for a new one, thinking I might have received a faulty unit, but the problem persisted. Leviton's claim that this switch supports Matter is, in my opinion, misleading. You’re required to A) sign up for a beta program, B) install beta firmware, and C) have a router that allows disabling specific Wi-Fi bands—all of which other brands do not require for their Matter-enabled devices.In summary, if you’re looking for a seamless Matter experience, this switch is not the way to go.###support<12:19>|matter<20:26>|base<56:61>|strong<67:73>|recommendation<74:88>|dozen<113:119>|install<120:127>|instal<120:129>|no issue<135:144>|issue<138:144>|relate<145:152>|connect<156:163>|connectivity<156:168>|reliability<172:183>|setup<185:190>|straightforward<195:210>|experience<219:229>|turn<245:249>|attempt<257:266>|add<270:273>|homekit<288:295>|matter<302:308>|fi<309:311>|support<339:346>|matter<347:353>|box<365:368>|require<378:385>|require<378:386>|enroll<390:396>|beta<402:406>|program<407:414>|install<419:426>|beta<427:431>|firmware<432:440>|enable<458:464>|matter<465:471>|functionality<472:485>|encounter<510:521>|issue<533:539>|numerous<549:557>|attempt<558:566>|connect<570:577>|include<579:588>|reset<589:598>|device<603:609>|restart<611:621>|router<625:631>|phone<636:641>|one<638:641>|troubleshooting<660:675>|step<676:680>|find<689:693>|simply<706:712>|pair<723:727>|homekit<733:740>|matter<745:751>|research<763:771>|discover<775:785>|forum<786:791>|post<792:797>|suggest<798:808>|matter<814:820>|require<821:828>|require<821:829>|wi<844:846>|fi<847:849>|wi fi<844:849>|wi fi network<844:857>|network<850:857>|fi network<847:857>|google<868:874>|nest<875:879>|google nest<868:879>|wi<880:882>|wi fi<880:885>|fi<883:885>|pro<886:889>|router<890:896>|allow<912:917>|disable<918:927>|specific<928:936>|wi<937:939>|wi fi<937:942>|fi<940:942>|band<943:948>|worth<955:960>|note<961:967>|matter<994:1000>|enable<1001:1007>|enable<1001:1008>|device<1009:1015>|device<1009:1016>|different<1022:1031>|different brand<1022:1038>|brand<1032:1038>|connect<1044:1051>|connect<1044:1053>|seamless<1054:1062>|seamlessly<1054:1064>|adjust<1084:1090>|network<1095:1102>|setting<1103:1111>|exchange<1119:1128>|new<1146:1149>|new one<1146:1153>|one<1150:1153>|a new one<1144:1153>|receive<1177:1185>|faulty<1188:1194>|unit<1195:1199>|problem<1209:1216>|leviton<1228:1235>|claim<1238:1243>|support<1261:1268>|support<1261:1269>|matter<1270:1276>|opinion<1287:1294>|require<1315:1322>|require<1315:1323>|sign<1330:1334>|beta<1344:1348>|program<1349:1356>|install<1361:1368>|beta<1369:1373>|firmware<1374:1382>|router<1398:1404>|allow<1410:1415>|allow<1410:1416>|disable<1417:1426>|specific<1427:1435>|wi<1436:1438>|wi fi<1436:1441>|fi<1439:1441>|band<1442:1447>|brand<1467:1473>|other brand<1461:1473>|require<1481:1488>|matter<1499:1505>|enable<1506:1512>|enable<1506:1513>|device<1514:1520>|device<1514:1521>|seamless<1558:1566>|matter<1567:1573>|experience<1574:1584>",
      "Removed support for 5Ghz WiFi###remove<0:7>|support<8:15>|wifi<25:29>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★☆☆☆ [2025-02-23] <b>Significant downgrade from the Gen 1 switches, removed support for 5Ghz WiFi</b> I already have multiple Leviton smart switches installed in my home as well as some installed in my parents house.  I have been very happy with these switches and have recommended them to multiple people over the years.I wanted to replace another switch in my home with a smart switch and honestly did not even consider any other brand besides Leviton.  I did however decided to get one of the newer 2nd generation switches that (supposedly) supports Matter, figuring it would be more future proof.For starters, the installation wasn't terrible, but wasn't any easier than the Gen 1 switches I have installed before.  Was hoping that the body of the switch would have shrunk a bit making for easier installation in tight switch boxes in our older home.After I got the install done I had a TERRIBLE time getting the switch trim plate on.  The trim plate is two pieces, the first piece (let's call it the base) is screwed onto the switch and the second snaps onto the first.  Well the screws that are provided to attach the base to the switch are very short.  This would not be such a big problem except that the holes don't line up well.  Eventually after much frustration I was able to get it on by backing the screws that held the switch in place but even then it doesn't feel secure.  I sure hope I can use a standard decora trim plate on this switch because I think I'm going to need to replace it.2nd problem was when I went to configure it, I already had the My Leviton app installed on my phone to support my existing switches.  I was able to connect the app to the new switch but was not able to see or select the network I wanted.  After more frustration I discovered that inexplicably Leviton decided to REMOVE support for 5Ghz WiFi networks.  I know that 2.4Ghz only WiFi chips are slightly cheaper than ones that support both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz but this level of feature cutting is a very bad sign.Honestly the primary reason I selected Leviton switches over TP-Link or others was the support for 5Ghz WiFi.  Leviton has deleted their sole competitive advantage over other, less expensive smart switches.Finally, as for the supposed Matter support.  I will admit I don't know a lot about Matter but I did try to use Matter to add it to my Google Home (instead of using the linked connection to the My Leviton app) but was unable to.  Google wanted me to scan a QR code on the box but the only QR coded on the box or in the manuals did not work and neither the box nor the manual said anything at all about Matter support.  So who knows if this device even supports Matter like the listing says it does, in any case I could not get it to work.Honestly, if it wouldn't have been such a PITA to rip this switch out of the wall and return it I would have.I did give 2* instead of 1 because it _does_ work.  I was able to get it connected to my Google Home via the link to My Leviton and am able to control it but it's fallen FAR short of my expectations.###significant<3:14>|downgrade<15:24>|gen<34:37>|remove<50:57>|support<58:65>|wifi<75:79>|already<86:93>|multiple<99:107>|leviton<108:115>|smart<116:121>|leviton smart switch<108:130>|all<135:138>|install<131:138>|instal<131:140>|home<147:151>|install<168:175>|all<172:175>|instal<168:177>|parent<184:191>|house<192:197>|happy<217:222>|recommend<252:263>|multiple<272:280>|people<281:287>|year<297:302>|replace<315:322>|place<317:322>|home<344:348>|smart<356:361>|one<374:377>|one<374:378>|honestly<373:381>|consider<395:403>|other brand<408:419>|brand<414:419>|leviton<428:435>|however<444:451>|decide<452:459>|one<467:470>|new<478:481>|new<478:483>|2nd<484:487>|generation<488:498>|2nd generation<484:498>|suppose<514:522>|support<526:533>|support<526:534>|matter<535:541>|figure<543:551>|future<569:575>|future proof<569:581>|proof<576:581>|all<604:607>|install<600:607>|installation<600:612>|easy<645:651>|gen<661:664>|all<687:690>|install<683:690>|instal<683:692>|hope<706:712>|body<722:726>|easy<776:782>|install<783:790>|all<787:790>|installation<783:795>|easy installation<776:795>|tight<799:804>|box<812:815>|box<812:817>|old<825:830>|old home<825:835>|home<831:835>|install<852:859>|all<856:859>|one<861:864>|trim<906:910>|trim plate<906:916>|plate<911:916>|trim<926:930>|plate<931:936>|trim plate<926:936>|piece<944:949>|piece<944:950>|first<956:961>|piece<962:967>|let<969:972>|all<976:979>|call<975:979>|base<987:991>|screw<996:1003>|second<1028:1034>|snap<1035:1040>|first<1050:1055>|screw<1067:1073>|provide<1083:1091>|attach<1095:1101>|base<1106:1110>|short<1134:1139>|big<1167:1170>|problem<1171:1178>|hole<1195:1200>|line<1207:1211>|all<1228:1231>|eventually<1222:1232>|frustration<1244:1255>|able<1262:1266>|back<1283:1290>|screw<1295:1301>|hold<1307:1311>|place<1326:1331>|feel<1357:1361>|secure<1362:1368>|hope<1378:1382>|standard<1395:1403>|decora<1404:1410>|standard decora<1395:1410>|trim<1411:1415>|trim plate<1411:1421>|plate<1416:1421>|replace<1474:1481>|place<1476:1481>|2nd<1485:1488>|problem<1489:1496>|configure<1516:1525>|already<1532:1539>|leviton<1551:1558>|leviton app<1551:1562>|all<1567:1570>|install<1563:1570>|instal<1563:1572>|one<1581:1584>|phone<1579:1584>|support<1588:1595>|exist<1599:1607>|able<1625:1629>|connect<1633:1640>|new<1656:1659>|able<1679:1683>|select<1694:1700>|network<1705:1712>|frustration<1735:1746>|discover<1749:1759>|leviton<1778:1785>|decide<1786:1793>|remove<1797:1803>|support<1804:1811>|wifi<1821:1825>|network<1826:1833>|wifi network<1821:1834>|network<1826:1834>|wifi<1861:1865>|slightly<1876:1884>|cheap<1885:1892>|one<1898:1901>|one<1898:1902>|support<1908:1915>|level<1946:1951>|feature<1955:1962>|sign<1985:1989>|one<1991:1994>|one<1991:1995>|honestly<1990:1998>|primary<2003:2010>|reason<2011:2017>|select<2020:2026>|select<2020:2028>|leviton<2029:2036>|tp<2051:2053>|link<2054:2058>|tp link<2051:2058>|support<2077:2084>|wifi<2094:2098>|leviton<2101:2108>|let<2115:2118>|delete<2113:2120>|less<2166:2170>|expensive<2171:2180>|smart<2181:2186>|all<2199:2202>|finally<2196:2203>|suppose<2216:2224>|matter<2225:2231>|support<2232:2239>|matter support<2225:2239>|admit<2249:2254>|matter<2280:2286>|matter<2308:2314>|add<2318:2321>|google<2331:2337>|home<2338:2342>|google home<2331:2342>|instead<2344:2351>|link<2365:2369>|link<2365:2371>|connect<2372:2379>|connection<2372:2382>|leviton<2393:2400>|leviton app<2393:2404>|unable<2414:2420>|able<2416:2420>|google<2426:2432>|scan<2446:2450>|qr<2453:2455>|a qr code<2451:2460>|qr code<2453:2460>|code<2456:2460>|box<2468:2471>|qr<2485:2487>|qr code<2485:2492>|code<2488:2492>|code<2488:2493>|qr code<2485:2493>|box<2501:2504>|manual<2515:2521>|manual<2515:2522>|box<2552:2555>|manual<2564:2570>|all<2588:2591>|matter<2598:2604>|support<2605:2612>|matter support<2598:2612>|device<2636:2642>|support<2648:2655>|support<2648:2656>|matter<2657:2663>|listing<2673:2680>|case<2702:2706>|one<2735:2738>|one<2735:2739>|honestly<2734:2742>|rip<2784:2787>|all<2812:2815>|wall<2811:2815>|return<2820:2826>|give<2849:2853>|instead<2857:2864>|able<2901:2905>|connect<2916:2923>|connect<2916:2925>|google<2932:2938>|home<2939:2943>|google home<2932:2943>|link<2952:2956>|leviton<2963:2970>|able<2978:2982>|control<2986:2993>|all<3007:3010>|fall<3006:3012>|far<3013:3016>|short<3017:3022>|expectation<3029:3041>",
      "Supports only 2.4 GHz WiFi band###support<0:8>|ghz<18:21>|2.4 ghz<14:21>|wifi<22:26>|band<27:31>|||B079775ZZQ ★★☆☆☆ [2023-01-14] <b>Not the best design and no web interface. Requires app for install and updates.</b> These are smart / WiFi dimmers that are hard-wired into a junction box for switched lights.Only supports 2.4 Ghz WifI band -- some of the hardware variants used in individual dimmers will stay connected indefinitely and some will disconnect and reconnect randomly and as frequently every few minutes.  It apparently has to do with the WiFi chips, firmware, or both.Sometimes the brightness level LEDs on the top if the dimmer will get stuck and stay on and at other times, they turn off after a few seconds.Alexa integration is OK for basic functions, but gets complicated rapidly as the number of named devices increases. You will need to come up with creative names if, for example, you have more than one dimmer per named room and then you will have to remember which are which. There is no alexa integration for calibration. firmware updates, or time or time zone adjustments.These dimmers work for most light sources:  incandescent (but wattage is limited to 200) and some dimmable fluorescent and some LED bulbs.Requires an app for initial installation, dimmer calibration, and for firmware or time updates.There is no easy reference source on the product page for bulb compatibility, so be sure you test your bulbs before going to the trouble to install these dimmers.Worked poorly on Feit LED candelabra bulbs: there was noticeable bulb flickering at dimming levels below 60 percent.Single pole (one switch) only.  Requires a neutral and ground connection, so there will be four wire connections per dimmer (green, white, and two for the controlled device).  Oddly, the green and white connections require wire nuts but the line and load are screwed into the side of the dimmer.Large back cover uses a lot of space in the junction box, so not the best choice for small or crowded junction boxes.The front up and down controls are too small and should be bigger.The indicator LED bulb is very dim and cannot be seen in a bright room.  A dimmable indicator on a dimmer would have been be a logical design choice, but it's not available on this model.There still is no web interface for these smart dimmers -- only app controls.  The Apple app does not support accessibility options and is not suitable for those with vision issues -- moreover, the contrast and size on the app screens is very poor even for those with good vision -- especially if your Apple device uses adaptive backlighting.There is a removable, screwless faceplate which is a nice feature. The face plate and switch front are a high gloss finish that shows fingerprints and scratches; a matte finish would be much better.There are two very small, unmarked and hard-to-access switches built into the dimmer bottom.  One reboots the dimmer without removing the programming and account information. The other wipes the device and removes it from an account.For those who prefer a flawless installation, be sure that the dimmer is not angled when you screw it into the junction box.  If there is any angle, the face plate will not fit flush with the dimmer. This is especially important if there are more than one switch or dimmer in a junction box.###design<16:22>|web<30:33>|interface<34:43>|face<39:43>|require<45:53>|install<62:69>|update<74:81>|smart<97:102>|wifi<105:109>|dim<110:113>|dimmer<110:116>|dimmer<110:117>|hard<127:131>|wire<132:136>|wire<132:137>|junction<145:153>|box<154:157>|junction

      "Does not provide SSID of their WiFi network###provide<9:16>|ssid<17:21>|wifi<31:35>|network<36:43>|wifi network<31:43>|||B08RSM1KYN ★☆☆☆☆ [2024-03-26] <b>Problem Here</b> These are easy to install and setup.  Their overall quality is higher than the Meross devices I replaced.  They require an account with Leviton for initial configuration, an undesirable privacy sacrifice, but Leviton's privacy policy is not egregiously bad.  A mobile phone is required for configuration, and the mobile app works well.  I am afraid to try the Matter capability because that is irreversible.  I have an Apple HomePod Mini, but I actually use Home Assistant, running on a Raspberry Pi, for domotics.At the time I purchased these, the instructions showed no means of rebooting the devices.  According to a Leviton support article, \"Simply press and hold the up paddle/button for 3 to 5 seconds and then release.  This reboots the device and runs a diagnostic mode.\"  According to the device documentation, holding the up/on button for seven seconds puts the device into \"setup mode\", temporarily.  Whether the device reboots is unclear.  Holding the up/on button for an additional seven seconds causes a reset to factory defaults--yikes.Regarding the motion-sensing switch, I have been tinkering with the motion-detection settings for more than a month.  It appears that the motion detection has significant variance in its radial sensitivity.  The response time is significant: you can walk by it in a hallway before it turns the light on.  Increasing the sensitivity improves that performance, but also causes nuisance trips.  I increased the sensitivity and blocked part of the sensor with white electrical tape.Today, all Leviton devices dropped off the WiFi network.  No other devices were affected.  Rebooting the wireless access point brought the Leviton devices back online.  This might be a problem with key rotation--an obvious flaw in Leviton's products.  I have a Cisco 2.4 GHz WiFi access point for these kinds of devices, and it shows the Leviton devices are using it.  The Leviton devices themselves do not provide the SSID of their WiFi network, apparently.  Changing WiFi settings requires a complete reset of the device--a huge inconvenience because the device loses its subscription to HomeKit, requiring re-subscription, becoming a new device, rewriting automations for the device, etc.Again, all six Leviton devices dropped off the WiFi network.  This time, I was at home and saw that a short-duration power surge had occurred.  All devices were flashing an amber light, indicating that WiFi connectivity was lost.  My wireless access point is protected from power problems by a UPS.  I tried the reboot instructions above, and none of the devices were recovered.  The Leviton app was incapable of recognizing and communicating with these devices.  The wireless access point did not show the Leviton devices connected.  Rebooting the wireless access point brought the Leviton devices back online.  Again, this is Leviton's fault, not Cisco's.  This problem has not recurred after several months, so it may have been fixed..I found that these devices apparently do not save their DHCP lease.  If they boot when the DHCP server is down, they will not have the TCP-IP configurations they received from the server, meaning they lose connectivity.  They do poll for the server and will regain their configuration if the server comes back online.Leviton pushes firmware updates to these devices, even though \"auto-updates\" is off.  Leviton publishes some descriptions of the updates, but those are not timely, and details are lacking.###problem<3:10>|re<13:15>|re<27:29>|easy<30:34>|install<38:45>|setup<50:55>|overall<64:71>|high<83:89>|meross<99:105>|device<106:112>|device<106:113>|re<116:118>|replace<116:124>|re<132:134>|re<137:139>|require<132:139>|account<143:150>|an

I purchased 2 of these “outdoor” versions to control my landscape lights thinking they would work as well as my “indoor” versions. However, their range is terrible in connecting to my Wi-Fi (I have a mesh network Wi-Fi system).  I was able to place my “indoor” Leviton smart plugs outside at the same locations I initially tried using these “outdoor” versions without success and the “indoor “ versions worked flawlessly. I have; therefore, installed water resistant electrical boxes at the outside locations and put the “indoor” smart plugs inside them which have worked well. These waterproof “outdoor” plugs are made to be used outdoors but are useless outside because in order for them to successfully connect to the Wi-Fi they essentially need to be within a few feet of a Wi-Fi repeater which totally defeats the purpose of these plugs supposedly able to be used outside.###wi<3:5>|wi fi<3:8>|fi<6:8>|range<9:14>|short<19:24>|nearly<38:44>|non<60:63>|water<64:69>|leviton<75:82>|smart<83:88>|leviton smart plug<75:94>|plug<89:94>|smart plug<83:94>|currently<101:110>|leviton<120:127>|smart<128:133>|leviton smart switch<120:142>|smart<147:152>|smart plug<147:158>|plug<153:158>|home<173:177>|outdoor<230:237>|version<239:247>|control<251:258>|indoor<319:325>|version<327:335>|however<337:344>|range<352:357>|connect<373:380>|connect<373:383>|wi<390:392>|fi<393:395>|wi fi<390:395>|mesh<406:410>|network<411:418>|mesh network<406:418>|wi<419:421>|wi fi<419:424>|fi<422:424>|system<425:431>|able<441:445>|place<449:454>|indoor<459:465>|leviton<467:474>|smart<475:480>|leviton smart plug<467:486>|plug<481:486>|smart plug<475:486>|same<502:506>|location<507:516>|initially<519:528>|outdoor<548:555>|version<557:565>|success<574:581>|indoor<591:597>|version<600:608>|flawlessly<616:626>|instal<647:656>|water<657:662>|electrical<673:683>|box<684:689>|electrical box<673:689>|location<705:714>|put<719:722>|indoor<728:734>|smart<736:741>|plug<742:747>|smart plug<736:747>|water<790:795>|outdoor<802:809>|plug<811:816>|outdoor<837:844>|useless<854:861>|success<899:906>|successfully<899:911>|connect<912:919>|wi<927:929>|fi<930:932>|wi fi<927:932>|the wi fi<923:932>|foot<974:978>|wi<984:986>|a wi fi<982:989>|fi<987:989>|wi fi<984:989>|totally<1005:1012>|purpose<1025:1032>|plug<1042:1047>|able<1059:1063>"

I have a Cisco 2.4 GHz WiFi access point for these kinds of devices, and it shows the Leviton devices are using it.  The Leviton devices themselves do not provide the SSID of their WiFi network, apparently.  Changing WiFi settings requires a complete reset of the device--a huge inconvenience because the device loses its subscription to HomeKit, requiring re-subscription, becoming a new device, rewriting automations for the device, etc.Again, all six Leviton devices dropped off the WiFi network.  This time, I was at home and saw that a short-duration power surge had occurred.  All devices were flashing an amber light, indicating that WiFi connectivity was lost.  My wireless access point is protected from power problems by a UPS.  I tried the reboot instructions above, and none of the devices were recovered.  The Leviton app was incapable of recognizing and communicating with these devices.  The wireless access point did not show the Leviton devices connected.  Rebooting the wireless access point brought the Leviton devices back online.  Again, this is Leviton's fault, not Cisco's.  This problem has not recurred after several months, so it may have been fixed..I found that these devices apparently do not save their DHCP lease.  If they boot when the DHCP server is down, they will not have the TCP-IP configurations they received from the server, meaning they lose connectivity.  They do poll for the server and will regain their configuration if the server comes back online.Leviton pushes firmware updates to these devices, even though \"auto-updates\" is off.  Leviton publishes some descriptions of the updates, but those are not timely, and details are lacking.###problem<3:10>|re<13:15>|re<27:29>|easy<30:34>|install<38:45>|setup<50:55>|overall<64:71>|high<83:89>|meross<99:105>|device<106:112>|device<106:113>|re<116:118>|replace<116:124>|re<132:134>|re<137:139>|require<132:139>|account<143:150>|an

      "2.4GHz only|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★★★ [2021-09-01] <b>Nice to see new models.  Looking forward to seeing how they perform.</b> I have many of the Gen 1 devices in my house.  Leviton has been my favorite brand for switches.  I also have tried Legrand and Aqara switches but always come back to Leviton as my fav.Pros:#1) 2.4GHz only:  I know a lot of people complain about this.  But I find this to be a benefit.  HomeKit does not need the bandwidth of 5GHz.  Most dual band mesh networks share a SSID and mine in particular (Orbi) cannot be separated.  My Gen 1 Decora Smart switches were constantly dropping with any WiFi interruption.  And these are the only HomeKit devices I have other than Apple TV and HomePods that are dual band devices.  I am looking forward to see how these new switches handle the same interruptions.#2) Self grounding:  The metal mounting flanges are self-grounding to metal switch boxes with grounded conduit.  This eliminates the need to use the ground wire.  I liked this about Gen 1 and am happy to see this also on the Gen 2.  Other brands use plastic mounting flanges that require the use of the ground wire.#3) It has both wireless and wired options for 3 way connections.  If you have a Gen 1 switch installed in a 3-way set up with a DD0SR coordinated remote this is a drop in replacement.  And now it gives you the option to use a wireless remote as well.Cons:#1) Setup:  The setup didn’t seem to go as smoothly as the Gen 1.  I attempted to add directly to Home App multiple times.  I reset the switch, restarted my phone, but could never “connect” to the switch when adding accessory.  I ended up having to add to the new Leviton app first, and then add to HomeKit via the Home app.  I also bought the new Gen 2 dimmer wall plug and had same experience.  I am not sure if it’s my system or the new device, but it wasn’t the experience I’m used to.#2) Wire Leads:  The Gen 1 had screw connections.  This is by far a better way to install IMO.  The leads and wire nuts take too much space.###new<15:18>|model<19:25>|forward<36:43>|perform<63:70>|gen<95:98>|device<101:107>|device<101:108>|house<115:120>|leviton<123:130>|favorite<143:151>|brand<152:157>|always<222:228>|back<234:238>|leviton<242:249>|now<286:289>|people<299:305>|lot of people<292:305>|complain<306:314>|find<334:338>|benefit<352:359>|home<362:366>|homekit<362:369>|band<388:392>|bandwidth<388:397>|most<408:412>|dual<413:417>|band<418:422>|mesh<423:427>|mesh network<423:436>|network<428:436>|share<437:442>|ssid<445:449>|particular<462:472>|orbi<474:478>|separate<490:499>|gen<505:508>|decora<511:517>|decora smart<511:523>|smart<518:523>|decora smart switch<511:532>|constantly<538:548>|drop<549:553>|drop<549:557>|wifi<567:571>|interruption<572:584>|home<610:614>|homekit<610:617>|device<618:624>|device<618:625>|apple<644:649>|tv<650:652>|home<657:661>|dual<675:679>|band<680:684>|device<685:691>|device<685:692>|forward<708:715>|new<733:736>|handle<746:752>|same<757:761>|interruption<762:774>|self<780:784>|ground<785:791>|ground<785:794>|metal<801:806>|mount<807:815>|flange<816:823>|self<828:832>|ground<833:839>|ground<833:842>|metal<846:851>|box<859:864>|ground<870:876>|ground<870:878>|eliminate<894:904>|ground<925:931>|ground wire<925:936>|wire<932:936>|gen<958:961>|happy<971:976>|gen<1001:1004>|brand<1015:1020>|brand<1015:1021>|other brand<1009:1021>|plastic<1026:1033>|mount<1034:1042>|flange<1043:1050>|require<1056:1063>|ground<1079:1085>|ground wire<1079:1090>|wire<1086:1090>|wire<1107:1111>|wireless<1107:1115>|wire<1120:1124>|wired<1120:1125>|option<1126:1132>|option<1126:1133>|3 way<1138:1143>|connect<1144:1151>|connection<1144:1155>|gen<1172:1175>|install<1185:1192>|instal<1185:1194>|3 way<1200:1205>|set<1206:1209>|remote<1238:1244>|drop<1255:1259>|replacement<1263:1274>|now<1281:1284>|give<1288:1293>|option<1302:1308>|wire<1318:1322>|wireless<1318:1326>|remote<1327:1333>|setup<1351:1356>|set<1363:1366>|setup<1363:1368>|smoothly<1390:1398>|gen<1406:1409>|attempt<1416:1425>|add<1429:1432>|directly<1433:1441>|home<1445:1449>|multiple<1454:1462>|multiple time<1454:1468>|reset<1473:1478>|set<1475:1478>|restart<1491:1500>|phone<1504:1509>|never<1521:1526>|connect<1528:1535>|add<1556:1559>|add<1556:1562>|accessory<1563:1572>|end<1577:1582>|add<1596:1599>|new<1607:1610>|leviton<1611:1618>|leviton app<1611:1622>|first<1623:1628>|add<1639:1642>|home<1646:1650>|homekit<1646:1653>|home<1662:1666>|new<1691:1694>|gen<1695:1698>|dimmer<1701:1707>|wall<1708:1712>|plug<1713:1717>|same<1726:1730>|experience<1731:1741>|system<1769:1775>|new<1783:1786>|device<1787:1793>|experience<1813:1823>|wire<1840:1844>|lead<1845:1850>|gen<1857:1860>|screw<1867:1872>|connect<1873:1880>|connection<1873:1884>|far<1898:1901>|install<1918:1925>|lead<1936:1941>|wire<1946:1950>|nut<1951:1955>|wire nut<1946:1955>|space<1970:1975>"

      "Variance in radial sensitivity###sensitivity<19:30>|||B08RSM1KYN ★☆☆☆☆ [2024-03-26] <b>Problem Here</b> These are easy to install and setup.  Their overall quality is higher than the Meross devices I replaced.  They require an account with Leviton for initial configuration, an undesirable privacy sacrifice, but Leviton's privacy policy is not egregiously bad.  A mobile phone is required for configuration, and the mobile app works well.  I am afraid to try the Matter capability because that is irreversible.  I have an Apple HomePod Mini, but I actually use Home Assistant, running on a Raspberry Pi, for domotics.At the time I purchased these, the instructions showed no means of rebooting the devices.  According to a Leviton support article, \"Simply press and hold the up paddle/button for 3 to 5 seconds and then release.  This reboots the device and runs a diagnostic mode.\"  According to the device documentation, holding the up/on button for seven seconds puts the device into \"setup mode\", temporarily.  Whether the device reboots is unclear.  Holding the up/on button for an additional seven seconds causes a reset to factory defaults--yikes.Regarding the motion-sensing switch, I have been tinkering with the motion-detection settings for more than a month.  It appears that the motion detection has significant variance in its radial sensitivity.  The response time is significant: you can walk by it in a hallway before it turns the light on.  Increasing the sensitivity improves that performance, but also causes nuisance trips.  I increased the sensitivity and blocked part of the sensor with white electrical tape.Today, all Leviton devices dropped off the WiFi network.  No other devices were affected.  Rebooting the wireless access point brought the Leviton devices back online.  This might be a problem with key rotation--an obvious flaw in Leviton's products.  I have a Cisco 2.4 GHz WiFi access point for these kinds of devices, and it shows the Leviton devices are using it.  The Leviton devices themselves do not provide the SSID of their WiFi network, apparently.  Changing WiFi settings requires a complete reset of the device--a huge inconvenience because the device loses its subscription to HomeKit, requiring re-subscription, becoming a new device, rewriting automations for the device, etc.Again, all six Leviton devices dropped off the WiFi network.  This time, I was at home and saw that a short-duration power surge had occurred.  All devices were flashing an amber light, indicating that WiFi connectivity was lost.  My wireless access point is protected from power problems by a UPS.  I tried the reboot instructions above, and none of the devices were recovered.  The Leviton app was incapable of recognizing and communicating with these devices.  The wireless access point did not show the Leviton devices connected.  Rebooting the wireless access point brought the Leviton devices back online.  Again, this is Leviton's fault, not Cisco's.  This problem has not recurred after several months, so it may have been fixed..I found that these devices apparently do not save their DHCP lease.  If they boot when the DHCP server is down, they will not have the TCP-IP configurations they received from the server, meaning they lose connectivity.  They do poll for the server and will regain their configuration if the server comes back online.Leviton pushes firmware updates to these devices, even though \"auto-updates\" is off.  Leviton publishes some descriptions of the updates, but those are not timely, and details are

      "Significant response time###significant<0:11>|response<12:20>|response time<12:25>|||B08RSM1KYN ★☆☆☆☆ [2024-03-26] <b>Problem Here</b> These are easy to install and setup.  Their overall quality is higher than the Meross devices I replaced.  They require an account with Leviton for initial configuration, an undesirable privacy sacrifice, but Leviton's privacy policy is not egregiously bad.  A mobile phone is required for configuration, and the mobile app works well.  I am afraid to try the Matter capability because that is irreversible.  I have an Apple HomePod Mini, but I actually use Home Assistant, running on a Raspberry Pi, for domotics.At the time I purchased these, the instructions showed no means of rebooting the devices.  According to a Leviton support article, \"Simply press and hold the up paddle/button for 3 to 5 seconds and then release.  This reboots the device and runs a diagnostic mode.\"  According to the device documentation, holding the up/on button for seven seconds puts the device into \"setup mode\", temporarily.  Whether the device reboots is unclear.  Holding the up/on button for an additional seven seconds causes a reset to factory defaults--yikes.Regarding the motion-sensing switch, I have been tinkering with the motion-detection settings for more than a month.  It appears that the motion detection has significant variance in its radial sensitivity.  The response time is significant: you can walk by it in a hallway before it turns the light on.  Increasing the sensitivity improves that performance, but also causes nuisance trips.  I increased the sensitivity and blocked part of the sensor with white electrical tape.Today, all Leviton devices dropped off the WiFi network.  No other devices were affected.  Rebooting the wireless access point brought the Leviton devices back online.  This might be a problem with key rotation--an obvious flaw in Leviton's products.  I have a Cisco 2.4 GHz WiFi access point for these kinds of devices, and it shows the Leviton devices are using it.  The Leviton devices themselves do not provide the SSID of their WiFi network, apparently.  Changing WiFi settings requires a complete reset of the device--a huge inconvenience because the device loses its subscription to HomeKit, requiring re-subscription, becoming a new device, rewriting automations for the device, etc.Again, all six Leviton devices dropped off the WiFi network.  This time, I was at home and saw that a short-duration power surge had occurred.  All devices were flashing an amber light, indicating that WiFi connectivity was lost.  My wireless access point is protected from power problems by a UPS.  I tried the reboot instructions above, and none of the devices were recovered.  The Leviton app was incapable of recognizing and communicating with these devices.  The wireless access point did not show the Leviton devices connected.  Rebooting the wireless access point brought the Leviton devices back online.  Again, this is Leviton's fault, not Cisco's.  This problem has not recurred after several months, so it may have been fixed..I found that these devices apparently do not save their DHCP lease.  If they boot when the DHCP server is down, they will not have the TCP-IP configurations they received from the server, meaning they lose connectivity.  They do poll for the server and will regain their configuration if the server comes back online.Leviton pushes firmware updates to these devices, even though \"auto-updates\" is off.  Leviton publishes some descriptions of the updates, but those are not timely, and details are lacking.###problem<3:10>|re<13:15>|re<27:29>|easy<30:34>|install<38:45>|setup<50:55>|overall<64:71>|high<83:89>|meross<99:105>|device<106:112>|device<106:113>|re<116:118>|replace<116:124>|re<132:134>|re<137:139>|require<132:139>|account<143:150>|an

The motion module also works when it's turned off or snoozed in the app so it can be used for regular motion events even if it's \"disabled\".Also just a very good and high quality dimmer. I have 7 of these in total now and they work way better than the cheaper kasa dimmers. I have LED enclosures and these dim them without issue.

The two issues I have with it are:1) The minimum dimmer setting is too bright. I have 2 dimmers nearby, and this one is almost 75% brighter than their lowest setting. If you really want dim light, skip this switch!2) The faceplate snaps on. It comes connected to the switch, trying to install it almost broke the faceplate as it wouldn't snap off easily. Now that it's on the wall, pretty sure the only way the plate comes off is to break it or get lucky. Definitely not long lasting, but it's just a faceplate (can use another if you choose).###impressed<27:36>|a couple<40:48>|couple<42:48>|alexa<74:79>|now<95:98>|install<109:116>|instal<109:118>|issue<137:143>|minimum<170:177>|dim<178:181>|dimmer<178:184>|setting<185:192>|bright<200:206>|dim<217:220>|dimmer<217:223>|dimmer<217:224>|one<242:245>|almost<249:255>|bright<260:266>|bright<260:268>|low<280:286>|low setting<280:294>|setting<287:294>|dim<315:318>|skip<326:330>|plate<354:359>|faceplate<350:359>|snap<360:364>|snap<360:365>|connect<379:388>|install<414:421>|almost<425:431>|break<432:437>|faceplate<442:451>|plate<446:451>|snap<467:471>|easily<476:482>|now<484:487>|wall<505:509>|pretty<511:517>|plate<540:545>|break<562:567>|lucky<578:583>|definitely<585:595>|long<600:604>|faceplate<630:639>|plate<634:639>|choose<664:670>",

This is very important because if you want to include it in a double gang setting you're going to have a problem.2) The on/off is slow.

They're great switches with one VERY annoying flaw. They just do not sit flush with the wall. Something about the way they are built causes the wallplate to stick outwards, leaving an unsightly gap in every single switch installed. I've tried with Kasa switch plates and other wallplates as well but no luck. If I use a Kasa switch and another switch in a dual gang wallplate, the Kasa switch side leaves a gap, the other doesn't. This is a flaw.Secondly, there are a lot of conflicting reports about this online so let me clear it up. The option to use this in combination with a remote switch does not work as confirmed by Kasa Support. E.g. If I have one as a wall switch, and want a secondary switch on my desk to control the same device, I cannot to that. Don't waste your money like me trying it out.###sit<12:15>|flush<16:21>|otherwise<26:35>|house<75:80>|annoying<119:127>|flaw<128:132>|sit<151:154>|flush<155:160>|wall<170:174>|build<209:214>|cause<215:221>|wall<226:230>|wallplate<226:235>|stick<239:244>|leave<255:262>|gap<276:279>|single<289:295>|instal<303:312>|kasa<330:334>|plate<342:348>|wall<359:363>|wallplate<359:368>|wallplate<359:369>|plate<363:369>|luck<385:389>|no luck<382:389>|kasa<402:406>|dual<438:442>|gang<443:447>|wall<448:452>|gang wallplate<443:457>|wallplate<448:457>|kasa<463:467>|side<475:479>|leave<480:486>|a gap<487:492>|gap<489:492>|flaw<523:527>|report<569:576>|online<588:594>|let<598:601>|clear<605:610>|option<622:628>|combination<644:655>|remote<663:669>|confirm<694:703>|kasa<707:711>|support<712:719>|wall<745:749>|control<800:807>|same<812:816>|device<817:823>|waste<849:854>|money<860:865>",

      "Trim plate consists of two pieces###trim<0:4>|plate<5:10>|trim plate<0:10>|piece<27:33>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★☆☆☆ [2025-02-23] <b>Significant downgrade from the Gen 1 switches, removed support for 5Ghz WiFi</b> I already have multiple Leviton smart switches installed in my home as well as some installed in my parents house.  I have been very happy with these switches and have recommended them to multiple people over the years.I wanted to replace another switch in my home with a smart switch and honestly did not even consider any other brand besides Leviton.  I did however decided to get one of the newer 2nd generation switches that (supposedly) supports Matter, figuring it would be more future proof.For starters, the installation wasn't terrible, but wasn't any easier than the Gen 1 switches I have installed before.  Was hoping that the body of the switch would have shrunk a bit making for easier installation in tight switch boxes in our older home.After I got the install done I had a TERRIBLE time getting the switch trim plate on.  The trim plate is two pieces, the first piece (let's call it the base) is screwed onto the switch and the second snaps onto the first.  Well the screws that are provided to attach the base to the switch are very short.  This would not be such a big problem except that the holes don't line up well.  Eventually after much frustration I was able to get it on by backing the screws that held the switch in place but even then it doesn't feel secure.  I sure hope I can use a standard decora trim plate on this switch because I think I'm going to need to replace it.2nd problem was when I went to configure it, I already had the My Leviton app installed on my phone to support my existing switches.  I was able to connect the app to the new switch but was not able to see or select the network I wanted.  After more frustration I discovered that inexplicably Leviton decided to REMOVE support for 5Ghz WiFi networks.  I know that 2.4Ghz only WiFi chips are slightly cheaper than ones that support both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz but this level of feature cutting is a very bad sign.Honestly the primary reason I selected Leviton switches over TP-Link or others was the support for 5Ghz WiFi.  Leviton has deleted their sole competitive advantage over other, less expensive smart switches.Finally, as for the supposed Matter support.  I will admit I don't know a lot about Matter but I did try to use Matter to add it to my Google Home (instead of using the linked connection to the My Leviton app) but was unable to.  Google wanted me to scan a QR code on the box but the only QR coded on the box or in the manuals did not work and neither the box nor the manual said anything at all about Matter support.  So who knows if this device even supports Matter like the listing says it does, in any case I could not get it to work.Honestly, if it wouldn't have been such a PITA to rip this switch out of the wall and return it I would have.I did give 2* instead of 1 because it _does_ work.  I was able to get it connected to my Google Home via the link to My Leviton and am able to control it but it's fallen FAR short of my expectations.###significant<3:14>|downgrade<15:24>|gen<34:37>|remove<50:57>|support<58:65>|wifi<75:79>|already<86:93>|multiple<99:107>|leviton<108:115>|smart<116:121>|leviton smart switch<108:130>|all<135:138>|install<131:138>|instal<131:140>|home<147:151>|install<168:175>|all<172:175>|instal<168:177>|parent<184:191>|house<192:197>|happy<217:222>|recommend<252:263>|multiple<272:280>|people<281:287>|year<297:302>|replace<315:322>|place<317:322>|home<344:348>|smart<356:361>|one<374:377>|one<374:378>|honestly<373:381>|consider<395:403>|other brand<408:419>|brand<414:419>|leviton<428:435>|however<444:451>|decide<452:459>|one<467:470>|new<478:481>|new<478:483>|2nd<484:487>|generation<488:498>|2nd generation<484:498>|suppose<514:522>|support<526:533>|support<526:534>|matter<535:541>|figure<543:551>|future<569:575>|future proof<569:581>|proof<576:581>|all<604:607>|install<600:607>|installation<600:612>|easy<645:651>|gen<661:664>|all<687:690>|install<683:690>|instal<683:692>|hope<706:712>|body<722:726>|easy<776:782>|install<783:790>|all<787:790>|installation<783:795>|easy installation<776:795>|tight<799:804>|box<812:815>|box<812:817>|old<825:830>|old home<825:835>|home<831:835>|install<852:859>|all<856:859>|one<861:864>|trim<906:910>|trim plate<906:916>|plate<911:916>|trim<926:930>|plate<931:936>|trim plate<926:936>|piece<944:949>|piece<944:950>|first<956:961>|piece<962:967>|let<969:972>|all<976:979>|call<975:979>|base<987:991>|screw<996:1003>|second<1028:1034>|snap<1035:1040>|first<1050:1055>|screw<1067:1073>|provide<1083:1091>|attach<1095:1101>|base<1106:1110>|short<1134:1139>|big<1167:1170>|problem<1171:1178>|hole<1195:1200>|line<1207:1211>|all<1228:1231>|eventually<1222:1232>|frustration<1244:1255>|able<1262:1266>|back<1283:1290>|screw<1295:1301>|hold<1307:1311>|place<1326:1331>|feel<1357:1361>|secure<1362:1368>|hope<1378:1382>|standard<1395:1403>|decora<1404:1410>|standard decora<1395:1410>|trim<1411:1415>|trim plate<1411:1421>|plate<1416:1421>|replace<1474:1481>|place<1476:1481>|2nd<1485:1488>|problem<1489:1496>|configure<1516:1525>|already<1532:1539>|leviton<1551:1558>|leviton app<1551:1562>|all<1567:1570>|install<1563:1570>|instal<1563:1572>|one<1581:1584>|phone<1579:1584>|support<1588:1595>|exist<1599:1607>|able<1625:1629>|connect<1633:1640>|new<1656:1659>|able<1679:1683>|select<1694:1700>|network<1705:1712>|frustration<1735:1746>|discover<1749:1759>|leviton<1778:1785>|decide<1786:1793>|remove<1797:1803>|support<1804:1811>|wifi<1821:1825>|network<1826:1833>|wifi network<1821:1834>|network<1826:1834>|wifi<1861:1865>|slightly<1876:1884>|cheap<1885:1892>|one<1898:1901>|one<1898:1902>|support<1908:1915>|level<1946:1951>|feature<1955:1962>|sign<1985:1989>|one<1991:1994>|one<1991:1995>|honestly<1990:1998>|primary<2003:2010>|reason<2011:2017>|select<2020:2026>|select<2020:2028>|leviton<2029:2036>|tp<2051:2053>|link<2054:2058>|tp link<2051:2058>|support<2077:2084>|wifi<2094:2098>|leviton<2101:2108>|let<2115:2118>|delete<2113:2120>|less<2166:2170>|expensive<2171:2180>|smart<2181:2186>|all<2199:2202>|finally<2196:2203>|suppose<2216:2224>|matter<2225:2231>|support<2232:2239>|matter support<2225:2239>|admit<2249:2254>|matter<2280:2286>|matter<2308:2314>|add<2318:2321>|google<2331:2337>|home<2338:2342>|google home<2331:2342>|instead<2344:2351>|link<2365:2369>|link<2365:2371>|connect<2372:2379>|connection<2372:2382>|leviton<2393:2400>|leviton app<2393:2404>|unable<2414:2420>|able<2416:2420>|google<2426:2432>|scan<2446:2450>|qr<2453:2455>|a qr code<2451:2460>|qr code<2453:2460>|code<2456:2460>|box<2468:2471>|qr<2485:2487>|qr code<2485:2492>|code<2488:2492>|code<2488:2493>|qr code<2485:2493>|box<2501:2504>|manual<2515:2521>|manual<2515:2522>|box<2552:2555>|manual<2564:2570>|all<2588:2591>|matter<2598:2604>|support<2605:2612>|matter support<2598:2612>|device<2636:2642>|support<2648:2655>|support<2648:2656>|matter<2657:2663>|listing<2673:2680>|case<2702:2706>|one<2735:2738>|one<2735:2739>|honestly<2734:2742>|rip<2784:2787>|all<2812:2815>|wall<2811:2815>|return<2820:2826>|give<2849:2853>|instead<2857:2864>|able<2901:2905>|connect<2916:2923>|connect<2916:2925>|google<2932:2938>|home<2939:2943>|google home<2932:2943>|link<2952:2956>|leviton<2963:2970>|able<2978:2982>|control<2986:2993>|all<3007:3010>|fall<3006:3012>|far<3013:3016>|short<3017:3022>|expectation<3029:3041>",

      "Plate with zero screws###plate<0:5>|screw<16:22>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2020-05-21] <b>Amazing switch- first time smart switch installer!</b> I absolutely love these switches. I have small 2 kids and they constantly leave the lights on in our entire downstairs family room area. I often wouldn't know that they left a light on for hours or, for the garage, the whole night sometimes.So I had to find something that would stop the headache. T bought this switch specifically for our family room/playroomMy goals when I started shopping:* Find a switch that has a plate with zero screws if I could- I liked the look for areas that mattered. this is a single switch and comes with a plate with no screws. I couldn't use it for where I was installing this but will save the plate for something else* Reliable light that would work well with wifi and my Amazon Alexa* \"Quick\" response when you give the order to Alexa- some lights had a bit of a delay from your request to when it actually turned on* a brand that could offer multiple models so I wouldn't have to download multiple apps to get them to work* a switch that did not have a super bright light that stayed on all the time- like the little green light. This one has a faint circle when the light is off that is perfect.These covered it all. I am pretty handy with electrical and I was able to install these myself in about 10-15 mins. The app has an amazing walk through to make it even easier.From there it was basically 2 clicks to have it sync with my Alexa and I was well on my way. I couldn't be happier.Couple of things to note:1) make sure you have a strong wifi signal in the area where you are wanting to set these up- I put 2 of them in my garage and it took a bit longer for them to sync as the wifi isn't super strong as soon as i walk through my garage doors2) This brand does not come as a double with a double plate- so as you will notice in the picture in the case of the double switch I used one that had exposed screws.3) The dimmer function is great- it has you test how low your lights will go during setup and then that sets the \"range\" that it dims. You can also use the app to further customize the range.Love these and plan on buying many more of this brand.###first<19:24>|first time<19:29>|smart<30:35>|install<43:50>|absolutely<60:70>|love<71:75>|small<99:104>|kid<107:111>|constantly<121:131>|leave<132:137>|entire<159:165>|family<177:183>|family room<177:188>|room<184:188>|area<189:193>|often<197:202>|leave<227:231>|hour<247:252>|garage<265:271>|whole<277:282>|night<283:288>|sometimes<289:298>|find<311:315>|stop<337:341>|headache<346:354>|specifically<377:389>|family<398:404>|family room<398:409>|room<405:409>|room<414:418>|start<434:441>|shop<442:450>|find<453:457>|plate<478:483>|screw<494:500>|area<534:538>|area<534:539>|matter<545:553>|single<565:571>|plate<596:601>|screw<610:616>|install<652:659>|instal<652:662>|save<677:681>|plate<686:691>|reliable<712:720>|able<716:720>|wifi<753:757>|amazon alexa<765:777>|alexa<772:777>|quick<780:785>|quick response<780:795>|response<787:795>|give<805:809>|alexa<823:828>|delay<857:862>|request<873:880>|actually<892:900>|turn<901:907>|brand<914:919>|offer<931:936>|multiple<937:945>|model<946:952>|download<975:983>|multiple<984:992>|super<1048:1053>|bright<1054:1060>|stay<1072:1078>|green<1112:1117>|one<1130:1133>|faint<1140:1145>|circle<1146:1152>|cover<1197:1204>|pretty<1218:1224>|handy<1225:1230>|electrical<1236:1246>|able<1257:1261>|install<1265:1272>|min<1301:1305>|walk<1330:1334>|easy<1359:1365>|basically<1384:1393>|click<1396:1402>|sync<1414:1418>|alexa<1427:1432>|happy<1473:1480>|couple<1481:1487>|strong<1530:1536>|wifi<1537:1541>|signal<1542:1548>|wifi signal<1537:1548>|area<1556:1560>|set<1586:1589>|put<1602:1605>|garage<1622:1628>|long<1647:1653>|sync<1666:1670>|wifi<1678:1682>|super<1689:1694>|strong<1695:1701>|soon<1705:1709>|walk<1715:1719>|garage<1731:1737>|brand<1751:1756>|double<1776:1782>|double<1790:1796>|plate<1797:1802>|notice<1819:1825>|picture<1833:1840>|case<1848:1852>|double<1860:1866>|one<1881:1884>|screw<1902:1908>|dimmer<1916:1922>|function<1923:1931>|the dimmer function<1912:1931>|test<1953:1957>|low<1962:1965>|set<1993:1996>|setup<1993:1998>|set<2013:2016>|set<2013:2017>|range<2023:2028>|dim<2038:2042>|far<2072:2079>|customize<2080:2089>|range<2094:2099>|love<2100:2104>|plan<2115:2119>|brand<2148:2153>",
      "Removable, screwless faceplate###screwless<11:20>|faceplate<21:30>|||B079775ZZQ ★★☆☆☆ [2023-01-14] <b>Not the best design and no web interface. Requires app for install and updates.</b> These are smart / WiFi dimmers that are hard-wired into a junction box for switched lights.Only supports 2.4 Ghz WifI band -- some of the hardware variants used in individual dimmers will stay connected indefinitely and some will disconnect and reconnect randomly and as frequently every few minutes.  It apparently has to do with the WiFi chips, firmware, or both.Sometimes the brightness level LEDs on the top if the dimmer will get stuck and stay on and at other times, they turn off after a few seconds.Alexa integration is OK for basic functions, but gets complicated rapidly as the number of named devices increases. You will need to come up with creative names if, for example, you have more than one dimmer per named room and then you will have to remember which are which. There is no alexa integration for calibration. firmware updates, or time or time zone adjustments.These dimmers work for most light sources:  incandescent (but wattage is limited to 200) and some dimmable fluorescent and some LED bulbs.Requires an app for initial installation, dimmer calibration, and for firmware or time updates.There is no easy reference source on the product page for bulb compatibility, so be sure you test your bulbs before going to the trouble to install these dimmers.Worked poorly on Feit LED candelabra bulbs: there was noticeable bulb flickering at dimming levels below 60 percent.Single pole (one switch) only.  Requires a neutral and ground connection, so there will be four wire connections per dimmer (green, white, and two for the controlled device).  Oddly, the green and white connections require wire nuts but the line and load are screwed into the side of the dimmer.Large back cover uses a lot of space in the junction box, so not the best choice for small or crowded junction boxes.The front up and down controls are too small and should be bigger.The indicator LED bulb is very dim and cannot be seen in a bright room.  A dimmable indicator on a dimmer would have been be a logical design choice, but it's not available on this model.There still is no web interface for these smart dimmers -- only app controls.  The Apple app does not support accessibility options and is not suitable for those with vision issues -- moreover, the contrast and size on the app screens is very poor even for those with good vision -- especially if your Apple device uses adaptive backlighting.There is a removable, screwless faceplate which is a nice feature. The face plate and switch front are a high gloss finish that shows fingerprints and scratches; a matte finish would be much better.There are two very small, unmarked and hard-to-access switches built into the dimmer bottom.  One reboots the dimmer without removing the programming and account information. The other wipes the device and removes it from an account.For those who prefer a flawless installation, be sure that the dimmer is not angled when you screw it into the junction box.  If there is any angle, the face plate will not fit flush with the dimmer. This is especially important if there are more than one switch or dimmer in a junction box.###design<16:22>|web<30:33>|interface<34:43>|face<39:43>|require<45:53>|install<62:69>|update<74:81>|smart<97:102>|wifi<105:109>|dim<110:113>|dimmer<110:116>|dimmer<110:117>|hard<127:131>|wire<132:136>|wire<132:137>|junction<145:153>|box<154:157>|junction

      "Switch plate doesn't sit well on the wall###plate<7:12>|sit<21:24>|wall<37:41>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2024-04-25] <b>It works</b> I like the way this dimmer functions. The build is not as refined as the more expensive units. Wiring the unit was easy. My main complaint is the mounting plate is fat, which makes the switch plate not sit well on the wall. This is with a remodel outlet box, results might be different with an old work box. I ground the back of the switch plate to make the plate fit to the wall. I have an expensive smart dimmer in another spot and the mounting plate was thinner so the switch plate fit the wall well.Side note, the privacy policy for using the app is less private than I would like. You either agree to it or you don't have smart dimmers. They do function without the app.###dimmer<36:42>|function<43:51>|function<43:52>|build<58:63>|expensive<94:103>|unit<104:108>|unit<104:109>|wire<111:117>|unit<122:126>|easy<131:135>|main<140:144>|complaint<145:154>|mount<162:170>|plate<171:176>|plate<208:213>|sit<218:221>|wall<234:238>|remodel<255:262>|outlet<263:269>|box<270:273>|outlet box<263:273>|result<275:282>|different<292:301>|old<310:313>|box<319:322>|ground<326:332>|back<337:341>|plate<356:361>|plate<374:379>|fit<380:383>|wall<391:395>|expensive<407:416>|smart<417:422>|dimmer<423:429>|smart dimmer<417:429>|spot<441:445>|mount<454:462>|plate<463:468>|thin<473:480>|plate<495:500>|fit<501:504>|wall<509:513>|side<519:523>|note<524:528>|privacy<534:541>|policy<542:548>|less<570:574>|smart<643:648>|dimmer<649:655>|smart dimmer<643:655>|smart dimmer<643:656>|dimmer<649:656>|function<666:674>",
      "Gap between wall and faceplate###gap<0:3>|wall<12:16>|faceplate<21:30>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2022-12-11] <b>Easy to install, set up and control with Alexa. Does not look perfect under standard faceplate.</b> I have installed five Kasa switches in my house and have a few more to do. No problems with any of the switches and they hook up and integrate well with Alexa. You have to download the Kasa application follow the prompts and set up the switch and once that is done go to your alexa application and find and enable the kasa skill, tell alexa to search for new devices and it will find your new switch.  It work so well I plan to do all my switches. Get yourself an electricity tester pen before you start and know your wire colors. Trust me you will need it for the three way version which is a little tricky to install.  Basic switch is easy if you have the white neutral wire which is required.  The only thing I absolutely do not like is how they don't sit well under a standard faceplate. It doesn't sit flat under the faceplate and leaves a gap around the edge.  If you only have one switch on the wall then the faceplate you get in the box will work fine but many of my switches have two or three switches side by side.  Kasa needs to make their switch lay flat against the wall so a standard cover will hide it better without that gap between the wall and the faceplate.###easy<3:7>|install<11:18>|set<20:23>|control<31:38>|alexa<44:49>|standard<79:87>|faceplate<88:97>|install<110:117>|instal<110:119>|kasa<125:129>|house<145:150>|no problem<178:189>|problem<181:189>|hook<224:228>|integrate<236:245>|alexa<256:261>|download<275:283>|kasa<288:292>|application<293:304>|follow<305:311>|prompt<316:323>|set<328:331>|alexa<379:384>|application<385:396>|find<401:405>|enable<410:416>|kasa<421:425>|skill<426:431>|alexa<438:443>|search<447:453>|new<458:461>|device<462:469>|find<482:486>|new<492:495>|plan<523:527>|electricity<567:578>|start<601:606>|wire<621:625>|color<626:632>|trust<634:639>|three way<668:677>|version<678:685>|tricky<704:710>|install<714:721>|basic<724:729>|easy<740:744>|white<761:766>|neutral<767:774>|neutral wire<767:779>|wire<775:779>|require<789:797>|absolutely<817:827>|sit<858:861>|standard<875:883>|faceplate<884:893>|sit<906:909>|flat<910:914>|faceplate<925:934>|leave<939:945>|gap<948:951>|a gap<946:951>|edge<963:967>|wall<1005:1009>|faceplate<1019:1028>|box<1044:1047>|side<1114:1118>|side<1122:1126>|side by side<1114:1126>|kasa<1129:1133>|lay<1161:1164>|flat<1165:1169>|wall<1182:1186>|standard<1192:1200>|cover<1201:1206>|hide<1212:1216>|gap<1240:1243>|wall<1256:1260>|faceplate<1269:1278>",

Because of that it took some work to get the old faceplate on and screwed in.That said, setup is incredibly easy if you follow through the app. Price is good to have the benefit of turning lights on at times intervals etc (I travel a lot so this is a huge help).Would buy again.###instal<31:40>|kasa<58:62>|total<83:88>|hour<103:107>|an hour<100:107>|dimmer<127:133>|one<134:137>|guess<188:193>|load<208:212>|live<217:221>|wire<222:226>|same<310:314>|plate<315:320>|screwless<343:352>|plate<353:358>|old<418:421>|plate<426:431>|faceplate<422:431>|screw<439:446>|setup<461:466>|incredibly<470:480>|easy<481:485>|follow<493:499>|price<517:522>|benefit<543:550>|turn<554:561>|interval<581:590>|travel<598:604>|huge<624:628>|again<645:650>",

This was particularly bothersome as I installed this in a 2-gang switch box along with a regular switch and it left the switch plate unbalanced. The Android widget is rather big (I think 1x3) for such a simple task (on/off, which could fit in 1x1) and strangely the app provides no info on the current status of the switch (whether it is on or off) - you basically get a bulky dumb remote on your phone with no useful information. The physical click switch looks like it is 'on' all the time and if you are someone who gets annoyed by switches not being in the 'right' position I think there is a chance you will get annoyed. I would have preferred a neutral or flat switch instead of one that is tilted on one side.###annoying<8:16>|point<17:23>|end<52:57>|intend<49:57>|wi<62:64>|wi fi<62:67>|fi<65:67>|wi fi connection<62:78>|fi connection<65:78>|connection<68:78>|easy<83:87>|end<91:96>|though<114:120>|mount<126:134>|plate<135:140>|plastic<152:159>|vs<161:163>|metal<164:169>|most<174:178>|wall<179:183>|thick<218:223>|leave<230:234>|a gap<235:240>|gap<237:240>|wall<253:257>|plate<273:278>|annoying<296:304>|particularly<315:327>|instal<344:353>|gang<366:370>|2 gang<364:370>|gang switch box<366:381>|box<378:381>|regular<395:402>|a regular switch<393:409>|leave<417:421>|plate<433:438>|android<455:462>|widget<463:469>|big<480:483>|simple<509:515>|task<516:520>|fit<542:545>|provide<576:584>|info<588:592>|current<600:607>|status<608:614>|basically<661:670>|bulky<677:682>|dumb<683:687>|remote<688:694>|phone<703:708>|useful<717:723>|info<724:728>|information<724:735>|physical<741:749>|click<750:755>|annoy<830:837>|position<875:883>|a chance<901:909>|chance<903:909>|annoy<923:930>|prefer<945:954>|neutral<957:964>|flat<968:972>|instead<980:987>|side<1017:1021>",
      "Holes for screws don't align well###hole<0:5>|screw<10:16>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★☆☆☆ [2025-02-23] <b>Significant downgrade from the Gen 1 switches, removed support for 5Ghz WiFi</b> I already have multiple Leviton smart switches installed in my home as well as some installed in my parents house.  I have been very happy with these switches and have recommended them to multiple people over the years.I wanted to replace another switch in my home with a smart switch and honestly did not even consider any other brand besides Leviton.  I did however decided to get one of the newer 2nd generation switches that (supposedly) supports Matter, figuring it would be more future proof.For starters, the installation wasn't terrible, but wasn't any easier than the Gen 1 switches I have installed before.  Was hoping that the body of the switch would have shrunk a bit making for easier installation in tight switch boxes in our older home.After I got the install done I had a TERRIBLE time getting the switch trim plate on.  The trim plate is two pieces, the first piece (let's call it the base) is screwed onto the switch and the second snaps onto the first.  Well the screws that are provided to attach the base to the switch are very short.  This would not be such a big problem except that the holes don't line up well.  Eventually after much frustration I was able to get it on by backing the screws that held the switch in place but even then it doesn't feel secure.  I sure hope I can use a standard decora trim plate on this switch because I think I'm going to need to replace it.2nd problem was when I went to configure it, I already had the My Leviton app installed on my phone to support my existing switches.  I was able to connect the app to the new switch but was not able to see or select the network I wanted.  After more frustration I discovered that inexplicably Leviton decided to REMOVE support for 5Ghz WiFi networks.  I know that 2.4Ghz only WiFi chips are slightly cheaper than ones that support both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz but this level of feature cutting is a very bad sign.Honestly the primary reason I selected Leviton switches over TP-Link or others was the support for 5Ghz WiFi.  Leviton has deleted their sole competitive advantage over other, less expensive smart switches.Finally, as for the supposed Matter support.  I will admit I don't know a lot about Matter but I did try to use Matter to add it to my Google Home (instead of using the linked connection to the My Leviton app) but was unable to.  Google wanted me to scan a QR code on the box but the only QR coded on the box or in the manuals did not work and neither the box nor the manual said anything at all about Matter support.  So who knows if this device even supports Matter like the listing says it does, in any case I could not get it to work.Honestly, if it wouldn't have been such a PITA to rip this switch out of the wall and return it I would have.I did give 2* instead of 1 because it _does_ work.  I was able to get it connected to my Google Home via the link to My Leviton and am able to control it but it's fallen FAR short of my expectations.###significant<3:14>|downgrade<15:24>|gen<34:37>|remove<50:57>|support<58:65>|wifi<75:79>|already<86:93>|multiple<99:107>|leviton<108:115>|smart<116:121>|leviton smart switch<108:130>|all<135:138>|install<131:138>|instal<131:140>|home<147:151>|install<168:175>|all<172:175>|instal<168:177>|parent<184:191>|house<192:197>|happy<217:222>|recommend<252:263>|multiple<272:280>|people<281:287>|year<297:302>|replace<315:322>|place<317:322>|home<344:348>|smart<356:361>|one<374:377>|one<374:378>|honestly<373:381>|consider<395:403>|other brand<408:419>|brand<414:419>|leviton<428:435>|however<444:451>|decide<452:459>|one<467:470>|new<478:481>|new<478:483>|2nd<484:487>|generation<488:498>|2nd generation<484:498>|suppose<514:522>|support<526:533>|support<526:534>|matter<535:541>|figure<543:551>|future<569:575>|future proof<569:581>|proof<576:581>|all<604:607>|install<600:607>|installation<600:612>|easy<645:651>|gen<661:664>|all<687:690>|install<683:690>|instal<683:692>|hope<706:712>|body<722:726>|easy<776:782>|install<783:790>|all<787:790>|installation<783:795>|easy installation<776:795>|tight<799:804>|box<812:815>|box<812:817>|old<825:830>|old home<825:835>|home<831:835>|install<852:859>|all<856:859>|one<861:864>|trim<906:910>|trim plate<906:916>|plate<911:916>|trim<926:930>|plate<931:936>|trim plate<926:936>|piece<944:949>|piece<944:950>|first<956:961>|piece<962:967>|let<969:972>|all<976:979>|call<975:979>|base<987:991>|screw<996:1003>|second<1028:1034>|snap<1035:1040>|first<1050:1055>|screw<1067:1073>|provide<1083:1091>|attach<1095:1101>|base<1106:1110>|short<1134:1139>|big<1167:1170>|problem<1171:1178>|hole<1195:1200>|line<1207:1211>|all<1228:1231>|eventually<1222:1232>|frustration<1244:1255>|able<1262:1266>|back<1283:1290>|screw<1295:1301>|hold<1307:1311>|place<1326:1331>|feel<1357:1361>|secure<1362:1368>|hope<1378:1382>|standard<1395:1403>|decora<1404:1410>|standard decora<1395:1410>|trim<1411:1415>|trim plate<1411:1421>|plate<1416:1421>|replace<1474:1481>|place<1476:1481>|2nd<1485:1488>|problem<1489:1496>|configure<1516:1525>|already<1532:1539>|leviton<1551:1558>|leviton app<1551:1562>|all<1567:1570>|install<1563:1570>|instal<1563:1572>|one<1581:1584>|phone<1579:1584>|support<1588:1595>|exist<1599:1607>|able<1625:1629>|connect<1633:1640>|new<1656:1659>|able<1679:1683>|select<1694:1700>|network<1705:1712>|frustration<1735:1746>|discover<1749:1759>|leviton<1778:1785>|decide<1786:1793>|remove<1797:1803>|support<1804:1811>|wifi<1821:1825>|network<1826:1833>|wifi network<1821:1834>|network<1826:1834>|wifi<1861:1865>|slightly<1876:1884>|cheap<1885:1892>|one<1898:1901>|one<1898:1902>|support<1908:1915>|level<1946:1951>|feature<1955:1962>|sign<1985:1989>|one<1991:1994>|one<1991:1995>|honestly<1990:1998>|primary<2003:2010>|reason<2011:2017>|select<2020:2026>|select<2020:2028>|leviton<2029:2036>|tp<2051:2053>|link<2054:2058>|tp link<2051:2058>|support<2077:2084>|wifi<2094:2098>|leviton<2101:2108>|let<2115:2118>|delete<2113:2120>|less<2166:2170>|expensive<2171:2180>|smart<2181:2186>|all<2199:2202>|finally<2196:2203>|suppose<2216:2224>|matter<2225:2231>|support<2232:2239>|matter support<2225:2239>|admit<2249:2254>|matter<2280:2286>|matter<2308:2314>|add<2318:2321>|google<2331:2337>|home<2338:2342>|google home<2331:2342>|instead<2344:2351>|link<2365:2369>|link<2365:2371>|connect<2372:2379>|connection<2372:2382>|leviton<2393:2400>|leviton app<2393:2404>|unable<2414:2420>|able<2416:2420>|google<2426:2432>|scan<2446:2450>|qr<2453:2455>|a qr code<2451:2460>|qr code<2453:2460>|code<2456:2460>|box<2468:2471>|qr<2485:2487>|qr code<2485:2492>|code<2488:2492>|code<2488:2493>|qr code<2485:2493>|box<2501:2504>|manual<2515:2521>|manual<2515:2522>|box<2552:2555>|manual<2564:2570>|all<2588:2591>|matter<2598:2604>|support<2605:2612>|matter support<2598:2612>|device<2636:2642>|support<2648:2655>|support<2648:2656>|matter<2657:2663>|listing<2673:2680>|case<2702:2706>|one<2735:2738>|one<2735:2739>|honestly<2734:2742>|rip<2784:2787>|all<2812:2815>|wall<2811:2815>|return<2820:2826>|give<2849:2853>|instead<2857:2864>|able<2901:2905>|connect<2916:2923>|connect<2916:2925>|google<2932:2938>|home<2939:2943>|google home<2932:2943>|link<2952:2956>|leviton<2963:2970>|able<2978:2982>|control<2986:2993>|all<3007:3010>|fall<3006:3012>|far<3013:3016>|short<3017:3022>|expectation<3029:3041>"

The plate is proprietary which seems unnecessary, and larger than it needs to be/normal Decora plates are.Overall though, I'm happy with it and plant to get a couple more of these and several of the 3 way ones.###minor<15:20>|downside<21:30>|description<77:88>|connect<94:102>|wifi<106:110>|easily<111:117>|kasa<130:134>|the kasa app<126:138>|kasa app<130:138>|adjustable<144:154>|dim<155:158>|dimmer<155:161>|limit<162:168>|google<185:191>|home<192:196>|google home<185:196>|turn<205:209>|dim<224:227>|minor<232:237>|downside<238:247>|size<255:259>|hard<284:288>|fit<292:295>|old<306:309>|box<310:315>|house<345:350>|plate<359:364>|plate<371:376>|proprietary<380:391>|large<421:427>|normal<448:454>|decora<455:461>|plate<462:467>|plate<462:468>|overall<473:480>|though<481:487>|happy<493:498>|a couple<524:532>|couple<526:532>|3 way<566:571>|one<572:576>",
      "Mounting screws too short###mount<0:8>|screw<9:15>|short<20:25>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2022-06-22] <b>Works well, but poor instructions and installation not for the faint of heart.</b> Took about 4 hours to install and get to work with Alexa.  The mounting screws were too short and I had to buy longer ones at the hardware store.  Although I regard myself as a pretty knowledge person regarding electric circuits and computers, Instructions for installation very confusing and difficult to follow. if you don't connect the line wire (coming from the power source) and the load wire (going to the bulb) to the correct terminals, the switch won't work, but the instructions don't warn you of this or tell you which terminal to connect which wire to.  Cost me an extra hour or so to figure this out.  You need to download the separate app from KASA and open a KASA account before connection to Alexa will work.  But looking for KASA on the list of compatible devices is just one of the annoyances.  The list is several hundred items long, and KASA is listed under \"T\", not \"K\" (for TP-Link), which cost me another 30 minutes to figure out. There was no warning to use only dimmable bulbs.  If you use non-dimmable bulbs, the switch will work but there will be a flicker--barely noticeable if you don't attempt to dim them, but increasingly noticeable and annoying if you do try to dim them.  When I replaced the bulbs with dimmable bulbs, everything worked perfectly.  I subtracted one star because of confusing or missing wiring instructions, failure to warn against using nondimmable bulbs and the need to buy longer mounting screws.One negative review claims that the switch will not work if you use more than one bulb in the circuit, but I found that incorrect and, in fact, the user manual, which can be downloaded from Amazon, tells you to test the dimmer function when installing the switch using \"bulbs\", in the plural. I am using multiple bulbs without a problem.###instruction<24:36>|install<41:48>|installation<41:53>|faint<66:71>|hour<99:103>|hour<99:104>|install<108:115>|alexa<137:142>|mount<149:157>|screw<158:164>|short<174:179>|long<197:201>|long<197:203>|one<204:207>|one<204:208>|hardware<216:224>|store<225:230>|regard<244:250>|pretty<263:269>|knowledge<270:279>|person<280:286>|regard<287:293>|regard<287:296>|electric<297:305>|circuit<306:313>|circuit<306:314>|computer<319:328>|instruction<330:342>|install<347:354>|installation<347:359>|confusing<365:374>|confuse<365:374>|difficult<379:388>|follow<392:398>|connect<413:420>|line<425:429>|wire<430:434>|power<452:457>|source<458:464>|load<474:478>|wire<479:483>|load wire<474:483>|bulb<498:502>|correct<511:518>|terminal<519:527>|terminal<519:528>|instruction<561:573>|warn<580:584>|terminal<615:623>|connect<627:634>|wire<641:645>|cost<651:655>|extra<662:667>|hour<668:672>|figure<682:688>|download<712:720>|load<716:720>|separate<725:733>|kasa<743:747>|open<752:756>|kasa<759:763>|kasa account<759:771>|account<764:771>|connect<779:786>|connection<779:789>|connection to alexa<779:798>|alexa<793:798>|kasa<827:831>|list<839:843>|compatible<847:857>|device<858:865>|one<874:877>|annoyance<885:895>|list<902:906>|long<932:936>|kasa<942:946>|list<950:954>|list<950:956>|tp<981:983>|tp link<981:988>|link<984:988>|cost<997:1001>|minute<1016:1023>|30 minute<1013:1023>|figure<1027:1033>|warn<1052:1056>|warning<1052:1059>|dim<1072:1075>|dimmable<1072:1080>|bulb<1081:1085>|bulb<1081:1086>|dimmable bulb<1072:1086>|bulbs<1081:1086>|non<1100:1103>|dim<1104:1107>|dimmable<1104:1112>|bulb<1113:1117>|dimmable bulb<1104:1118>|bulb<1113:1118>|bulbs<1113:1118>|flicker<1161:1168>|barely<1170:1176>|noticeable<1177:1187>|attempt<1201:1208>|dim<1212:1215>|noticeable<1239:1249>|annoying<1254:1262>|dim<1280:1283>|replace<1298:1306>|bulb<1311:1315>|bulb<1311:1316>|bulbs<1311:1316>|dim<1322:1325>|dimmable<1322:1330>|bulb<1331:1335>|dimmable bulb<1322:1336>|bulb<1331:1336>|bulbs<1331:1336>|perfectly<1356:1365>|one<1381:1384>|one star<1381:1389>|confuse<1401:1410>|confusing<1401:1410>|missing<1414:1421>|wiring<1422:1428>|wiring instruction<1422:1441>|instruction<1429:1441>|failure<1443:1450>|warn<1454:1458>|non<1473:1476>|dim<1476:1479>|dimmable<1476:1484>|bulb<1485:1489>|dimmable bulb<1476:1490>|bulbs<1485:1490>|bulb<1485:1490>|long<1511:1515>|long<1511:1517>|mount<1518:1526>|screw<1527:1533>|one<1534:1537>|negative<1538:1546>|claim<1554:1560>|one<1612:1615>|bulb<1616:1620>|circuit<1628:1635>|find<1643:1648>|correct<1656:1663>|incorrect<1654:1663>|fact<1672:1676>|user<1682:1686>|manual<1687:1693>|load<1712:1716>|download<1708:1716>|download<1708:1718>|test<1745:1749>|dim<1754:1757>|dimmer<1754:1760>|the dimmer function<1750:1769>|function<1761:1769>|install<1775:1782>|instal<1775:1785>|bulb<1804:1808>|bulbs<1804:1809>|bulb<1804:1809>|multiple<1838:1846>|bulb<1847:1851>|bulbs<1847:1852>|bulb<1847:1852>|multiple bulb<1838:1852>|problem<1863:1870>",

A little disappointing.</b> At this price point, it's hard to argue against this switch.  It will listen to your voice assistant and give you the dimmed settings you want.  My complaints are not enough to justify giving this more than one star off, but they are a little annoying.First is that the switch is a little slow to respond to regular operation (touching the switch itself).  It takes maybe a second for the lights to turn on.Second, the dimming stages are a little rough.  It gets about halfway up, pauses, then goes full brightness.  It's not my bulbs, either, these are brand-new, dimmable LEDs from a reputable manufacturer.Third, the switch is only available in white.  I realize that an alternate almond/ivory plate is probably more in the realm of much more expensive products (and a little wasteful to include only as a contingency alternative), but other brands offer replaceable faceplates that match your installed switches.Fourth, the included faceplate only goes on well if your wall and electrical box are well done.  This is probably more a knock on the contractor who installed the boxes in the room where I used this, but even so.  Many contractors don't bother with making boxes anything other than functional.  I had to buy a separate faceplate to make it work.Overall, though, combined with an inexpensive pack of bulbs, it's hard to argue against this price point.  Certainly beats putting smart bulbs everywhere in a situation where you have to control a large number of lights.###mostly<3:9>|job<19:22>|point<39:44>|disappointing<34:47>|price<61:66>|point<67:72>|price point<61:72>|hard<79:83>|listen<123:129>|voice<138:143>|assistant<144:153>|voice assistant<138:153>|give<158:162>|dim<171:177>|setting<178:186>|complaint<201:211>|give<238:244>|one star<260:268>|annoying<296:304>|first<305:310>|slow<342:346>|respond<350:357>|regular<361:368>|operation<369:378>|touch<380:388>|second<427:433>|turn<452:456>|second<460:466>|dim<472:479>|full<552:556>|full brightness<552:567>|brightness<557:567>|bulb<582:587>|either<589:595>|brand<607:612>|new<613:616>|dimmable<618:626>|dimmable led<618:631>|led<627:631>|manufacturer<649:661>|third<662:667>|available<688:697>|white<701:706>|realize<711:718>|almond<737:743>|plate<750:755>|probably<759:767>|expensive<799:808>|include<844:851>|alternative<874:885>|brand<898:903>|other brand<892:904>|brand<898:904>|offer<905:910>|plate<927:932>|faceplate<923:932>|faceplate<923:933>|match<939:944>|instal<950:959>|include<981:988>|include<981:989>|faceplate<990:999>|plate<994:999>|wall<1026:1030>|electrical<1035:1045>|electrical box<1035:1049>|box<1046:1049>|probably<1074:1082>|knock<1090:1095>|contractor<1103:1113>|instal<1118:1127>|box<1132:1135>|box<1132:1137>|room<1145:1149>|contractor<1188:1198>|contractor<1188:1199>|bother<1206:1212>|box<1225:1228>|box<1225:1230>|functional<1251:1261>|separate<1279:1287>|faceplate<1288:1297>|plate<1292:1297>|overall<1314:1321>|though<1323:1329>|combine<1331:1339>|expensive<1350:1359>|inexpensive<1348:1359>|pack<1360:1364>|bulb<1368:1373>|hard<1380:1384>|price<1407:1412>|point<1413:1418>|price point<1407:1418>|certainly<1421:1430>|put<1437:1444>|smart<1445:1450>|bulb<1451:1456>|everywhere<1457:1467>|situation<1473:1482>|control<1501:1508>|large<1511:1516>|number<1517:1523>"

I have been very happy with these switches and have recommended them to multiple people over the years.I wanted to replace another switch in my home with a smart switch and honestly did not even consider any other brand besides Leviton.  I did however decided to get one of the newer 2nd generation switches that (supposedly) supports Matter, figuring it would be more future proof.For starters, the installation wasn't terrible, but wasn't any easier than the Gen 1 switches I have installed before.  Was hoping that the body of the switch would have shrunk a bit making for easier installation in tight switch boxes in our older home.After I got the install done I had a TERRIBLE time getting the switch trim plate on.  The trim plate is two pieces, the first piece (let's call it the base) is screwed onto the switch and the second snaps onto the first.  Well the screws that are provided to attach the base to the switch are very short.  This would not be such a big problem except that the holes don't line up well.  Eventually after much frustration I was able to get it on by backing the screws that held the switch in place but even then it doesn't feel secure.  I sure hope I can use a standard decora trim plate on this switch because I think I'm going to need to replace it.2nd problem was when I went to configure it, I already had the My Leviton app installed on my phone to support my existing switches.  I was able to connect the app to the new switch but was not able to see or select the network I wanted.  After more frustration I discovered that inexplicably Leviton decided to REMOVE support for 5Ghz WiFi networks.  I know that 2.4Ghz only WiFi chips are slightly cheaper than ones that support both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz but this level of feature cutting is a very bad sign.Honestly the primary reason I selected Leviton switches over TP-Link or others was the support for 5Ghz WiFi.  Leviton has deleted their sole competitive advantage over other, less expensive smart switches.Finally, as for the supposed Matter support.  I will admit I don't know a lot about Matter but I did try to use Matter to add it to my Google Home (instead of using the linked connection to the My Leviton app) but was unable to.  Google wanted me to scan a QR code on the box but the only QR coded on the box or in the manuals did not work and neither the box nor the manual said anything at all about Matter support.  So who knows if this device even supports Matter like the listing says it does, in any case I could not get it to work.Honestly, if it wouldn't have been such a PITA to rip this switch out of the wall and return it I would have.I did give 2* instead of 1 because it _does_ work.  I was able to get it connected to my Google Home via the link to My Leviton and am able to control it but it's fallen FAR short of my expectations.###significant<3:14>|downgrade<15:24>|gen<34:37>|remove<50:57>|support<58:65>|wifi<75:79>|already<86:93>|multiple<99:107>|leviton<108:115>|smart<116:121>|leviton smart switch<108:130>|all<135:138>|install<131:138>|instal<131:140>|home<147:151>|install<168:175>|all<172:175>|instal<168:177>|parent<184:191>|house<192:197>|happy<217:222>|recommend<252:263>|multiple<272:280>|people<281:287>|year<297:302>|replace<315:322>|place<317:322>|home<344:348>|smart<356:361>|one<374:377>|one<374:378>|honestly<373:381>|consider<395:403>|other brand<408:419>|brand<414:419>|leviton<428:435>|however<444:451>|decide<452:459>|one<467:470>|new<478:481>|new<478:483>|2nd<484:487>|generation<488:498>|2nd generation<484:498>|suppose<514:522>|support<526:533>|support<526:534>|matter<535:541>|figure<543:551>|future<569:575>|future proof<569:581>|proof<576:581>|all<604:607>|install<600:607>|installation<600:612>|easy<645:651>|gen<661:664>|all<687:690>|install<683:690>|instal<683:692>|hope<706:712>|body<722:726>|easy<776:782>|install<783:790>|all<787:790>|installation<783:795>|easy installation<776:795>|tight<799:804>|box<812:815>|box<812:817>|old<825:830>|old home<825:835>|home<831:835>|install<852:859>|all<856:859>|one<861:864>|trim<906:910>|trim plate<906:916>|plate<911:916>|trim<926:930>|plate<931:936>|trim plate<926:936>|piece<944:949>|piece<944:950>|first<956:961>|piece<962:967>|let<969:972>|all<976:979>|call<975:979>|base<987:991>|screw<996:1003>|second<1028:1034>|snap<1035:1040>|first<1050:1055>|screw<1067:1073>|provide<1083:1091>|attach<1095:1101>|base<1106:1110>|short<1134:1139>|big<1167:1170>|problem<1171:1178>|hole<1195:1200>|line<1207:1211>|all<1228:1231>|eventually<1222:1232>|frustration<1244:1255>|able<1262:1266>|back<1283:1290>|screw<1295:1301>|hold<1307:1311>|place<1326:1331>|feel<1357:1361>|secure<1362:1368>|hope<1378:1382>|standard<1395:1403>|decora<1404:1410>|standard decora<1395:1410>|trim<1411:1415>|trim plate<1411:1421>|plate<1416:1421>|replace<1474:1481>|place<1476:1481>|2nd<1485:1488>|problem<1489:1496>|configure<1516:1525>|already<1532:1539>|leviton<1551:1558>|leviton app<1551:1562>|all<1567:1570>|install<1563:1570>|instal<1563:1572>|one<1581:1584>|phone<1579:1584>|support<1588:1595>|exist<1599:1607>|able<1625:1629>|connect<1633:1640>|new<1656:1659>|able<1679:1683>|select<1694:1700>|network<1705:1712>|frustration<1735:1746>|discover<1749:1759>|leviton<1778:1785>|decide<1786:1793>|remove<1797:1803>|support<1804:1811>|wifi<1821:1825>|network<1826:1833>|wifi network<1821:1834>|network<1826:1834>|wifi<1861:1865>|slightly<1876:1884>|cheap<1885:1892>|one<1898:1901>|one<1898:1902>|support<1908:1915>|level<1946:1951>|feature<1955:1962>|sign<1985:1989>|one<1991:1994>|one<1991:1995>|honestly<1990:1998>|primary<2003:2010>|reason<2011:2017>|select<2020:2026>|select<2020:2028>|leviton<2029:2036>|tp<2051:2053>|link<2054:2058>|tp link<2051:2058>|support<2077:2084>|wifi<2094:2098>|leviton<2101:2108>|let<2115:2118>|delete<2113:2120>|less<2166:2170>|expensive<2171:2180>|smart<2181:2186>|all<2199:2202>|finally<2196:2203>|suppose<2216:2224>|matter<2225:2231>|support<2232:2239>|matter support<2225:2239>|admit<2249:2254>|matter<2280:2286>|matter<2308:2314>|add<2318:2321>|google<2331:2337>|home<2338:2342>|google home<2331:2342>|instead<2344:2351>|link<2365:2369>|link<2365:2371>|connect<2372:2379>|connection<2372:2382>|leviton<2393:2400>|leviton app<2393:2404>|unable<2414:2420>|able<2416:2420>|google<2426:2432>|scan<2446:2450>|qr<2453:2455>|a qr code<2451:2460>|qr code<2453:2460>|code<2456:2460>|box<2468:2471>|qr<2485:2487>|qr code<2485:2492>|code<2488:2492>|code<2488:2493>|qr code<2485:2493>|box<2501:2504>|manual<2515:2521>|manual<2515:2522>|box<2552:2555>|manual<2564:2570>|all<2588:2591>|matter<2598:2604>|support<2605:2612>|matter support<2598:2612>|device<2636:2642>|support<2648:2655>|support<2648:2656>|matter<2657:2663>|listing<2673:2680>|case<2702:2706>|one<2735:2738>|one<2735:2739>|honestly<2734:2742>|rip<2784:2787>|all<2812:2815>|wall<2811:2815>|return<2820:2826>|give<2849:2853>|instead<2857:2864>|able<2901:2905>|connect<2916:2923>|connect<2916:2925>|google<2932:2938>|home<2939:2943>|google home<2932:2943>|link<2952:2956>|leviton<2963:2970>|able<2978:2982>|control<2986:2993>|all<3007:3010>|fall<3006:3012>|far<3013:3016>|short<3017:3022>|expectation<3029:3041>",
      "Comes with single plate###single<11:17>|plate<18:23>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★☆☆ [2024-11-20] <b>It works great BUT... yes BUT</b> The product itself is very good. It works perfectly fine and it dims the lights on command with the help of its native app or Google or Alexa, so.. 5 stars there, oh and also the price point is very good too.Now, why 3 stars? Well, two main reasons:1) The device itself is very bulky and you have to have plenty of room inside the wall/box in order to insert this thing. It took me a good 30min to make it work.2) When I was about to put the faceplate (I didn't use the provided single plate that came with the switch because I am using it on a dual switch plate), anyway... the thing is too thick and the face plate wouldn't lay flush on the wall, no matter how much I screwed this thing in, so I had to grab the dremmel and file down a bunch of material around the dimmer switch in order for the faceplate to lay flush. I had to be very careful in order to avoid damaging the areas that were going to be visible after installing the faceplate, but lucky for me, I was able to make it work it and it looks great!With that being said, If I needed to buy another one I probably would buy a different brand that has a more slim/thin device or maybe since I already know how to make it work with the dremmel, I would perhaps buy this one again since the price is very good and I would like everything else to match!With all that being said, this was my particular case.. maybe your faceplate is deeper/thicker than mine and this switch would work without having to modify it. But, just keep this in mind in case you do actually have to make it work if you want a clean install.###perfectly<79:88>|dim<101:105>|command<120:127>|help<137:141>|native<149:155>|native app<149:159>|google<163:169>|alexa<173:178>|5 star<185:192>|price<216:221>|price point<216:227>|point<222:227>|now<245:248>|3 star<254:261>|main<273:277>|device<293:299>|bulky<315:320>|plenty<342:348>|room<352:356>|wall<368:372>|box<373:376>|thin<401:405>|put<471:474>|face<479:483>|faceplate<479:488>|plate<483:488>|provide<507:515>|single<516:522>|plate<523:528>|dual<582:586>|plate<594:599>|anyway<602:608>|thin<616:620>|thick<629:634>|face<643:647>|plate<648:653>|face plate<643:653>|the face plate<639:653>|lay<663:666>|flush<667:672>|wall<680:684>|matter<689:695>|screw<707:714>|thin<720:724>|grab<742:746>|file<763:767>|bunch<775:780>|a bunch<773:780>|material<784:792>|dimmer<804:810>|face<835:839>|plate<839:844>|faceplate<835:844>|lay<848:851>|flush<852:857>|careful<876:883>|avoid<896:901>|damage<902:910>|area<915:920>|visible<943:950>|install<957:964>|instal<957:967>|face<972:976>|faceplate<972:981>|plate<976:981>|lucky<987:992>|able<1007:1011>|one<1099:1102>|probably<1105:1113>|different<1126:1135>|different brand<1126:1141>|brand<1136:1141>|a different brand<1124:1141>|slim<1158:1162>|thin<1163:1167>|device<1168:1174>|already<1192:1199>|perhaps<1251:1258>|one<1268:1271>|again<1272:1277>|price<1288:1293>|thin<1329:1333>|particular<1387:1397>|case<1398:1402>|face<1416:1420>|faceplate<1416:1425>|plate<1420:1425>|deep<1429:1435>|thick<1436:1441>|thick<1436:1443>|keep<1520:1524>|mind<1533:1537>|case<1541:1545>|actually<1553:1561>|clean<1597:1602>|install<1603:1610>"

First though, let me say how well it has worked in the hours that I've been using it.  Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant are both controlling even better than I'd hoped.  It dims easily by voice commands, via all the apps for Alexa, Google Home and Kasa, and of course using the physical buttons on the switch.  I can dim it to pretty much any percentage that I want and, contrary to some of the answered questions I've seen, the switch remembers the last dimmer setting when it turns back on instead of full brightness.Here's where I avoided giving it that 5th star.  For the installation, the face plate came pre-assembled and was ridiculously difficult to remove in order to install the switch.  After several minutes of struggling, it finally came off but only after it cracked the plastic upper piece where it attaches to the the body of the switch.  Fortunately, it was not too damaged to properly install it and the crack was not visible since it is behind the face plate.  Kasa people: it's great that the face plate fits so tightly once completely installed, but please don't pre-assemble it in the box if it is going to be such a challenge.  Once installed the switch worked perfectly as a standalone unit, but then the setup via the Kasa app took a dozen or so attempts before the device could finally be discovered over Wifi.  That was very aggravating.  I've got both 2.4g and 5g networks and tried using one or the other to see if that was the issue but it didn't seem to make any difference.  Additionally, this device is closer to my router than an existing Kasa non-dimmer smart switch and my phone was literally just inches away from the device, so those helpful hints on how to resolve it were not helping at all.In the end, it was well worth the money and minimal trouble.  I love that it does not require a hub like other products which I won't name and I'm happy that I chose this Kasa product instead.  I only wish I'd bought two of them at the great price offered during Cyber Monday...###once<18:22>|all<27:30>|install<23:30>|instal<23:32>|setup<37:42>|all<51:54>|give<66:70>|option<110:116>|an option<107:116>|main<144:148>|reason<149:156>|all<162:165>|install<158:165>|installation<158:170>|setup<175:180>|first<183:188>|though<189:195>|let<197:200>|hour<238:243>|amazon alexa<270:282>|alexa<277:282>|google<287:293>|assistant<294:303>|google assistant<287:303>|control<313:324>|hope<346:351>|dim<357:360>|dim<357:361>|easily<362:368>|voice<372:377>|command<378:386>|voice command<372:386>|all<392:395>|alexa<409:414>|google<416:422>|home<423:427>|google home<416:427>|kasa<432:436>|course<445:451>|physical<462:470>|physical button<462:478>|button<471:478>|dim<501:504>|pre<511:514>|pretty<511:517>|percentage<527:537>|answer<579:587>|question<588:597>|remember<620:629>|last<634:638>|dim<639:642>|dimmer<639:645>|set<646:653>|turn<662:667>|back<668:672>|instead<676:683>|full<687:691>|brightness<692:702>|full brightness<687:702>|avoid<718:725>|give<726:732>|all<764:767>|install<760:767>|installation<760:772>|face<778:782>|the face plate<774:788>|plate<783:788>|face plate<778:788>|pre<794:797>|difficult<829:838>|remove<842:848>|all<865:868>|install<861:868>|minute<896:903>|struggle<907:917>|all<925:928>|finally<922:929>|last<970:974>|plastic<969:976>|upper<977:982>|piece<983:988>|attach<998:1006>|body<1018:1022>|damage<1067:1074>|properly<1078:1086>|all<1091:1094>|install<1087:1094>|visible<1120:1127>|face<1151:1155>|plate<1156:1161>|the face plate<1147:1161>|face plate<1151:1161>|kasa<1164:1168>|people<1169:1175>|face<1197:1201>|plate<1202:1207>|face plate<1197:1207>|the face plate<1193:1207>|fit<1208:1212>|once<1224:1228>|let<1233:1236>|completely<1229:1239>|install<1240:1247>|all<1244:1247>|instal<1240:1249>|pre<1268:1271>|box<1291:1294>|all<1325:1328>|challenge<1323:1332>|once<1335:1339>|install<1340:1347>|all<1344:1347>|instal<1340:1349>|perfectly<1368:1377>|unit<1394:1398>|setup<1413:1418>|kasa<1427:1431>|the kasa app<1423:1435>|kasa app<1427:1435>|dozen<1443:1448>|a dozen<1441:1448>|attempt<1455:1463>|device<1475:1481>|all<1491:1494>|finally<1488:1495>|discover<1499:1509>|wifi<1515:1519>|network<1576:1584>|issue<1641:1646>|difference<1678:1688>|all<1699:1702>|additionally<1691:1703>|device<1710:1716>|close<1720:1726>|router<1733:1739>|exist<1748:1756>|kasa<1757:1761>|non<1762:1765>|dim<1766:1769>|dimmer<1766:1772>|smart<1773:1778>|phone<1793:1798>|all<1808:1811>|literally<1803:1812>|away<1825:1829>|device<1839:1845>|helpful<1856:1863>|resolve<1880:1887>|help<1900:1907>|all<1911:1914>|end<1922:1925>|worth<1939:1944>|money<1949:1954>|minimal<1959:1966>|trouble<1967:1974>|love<1979:1983>|require<2001:2008>|hub<2011:2014>|name<2049:2053>|happy<2062:2067>|choose<2075:2080>|kasa<2086:2090>|instead<2099:2106>|wish<2116:2120>|price<2157:2162>|great price<2151:2162>|offer<2163:2170>",

The only thing that it needs is Homekit compatibility, but since I usually talk to Alexa to control my lights, it still works for me even if it isn't in Apple's Home app. I'm using it to control a chandelier that is fitted with multiple dimmable LED bulbs and it works like a charm -- no issues whatsoever with the LED bulbs. It responds quickly and accurately.The price was also good in comparison to the others I looked at. As long as it doesn't fail or something, and continues working as it is now, I can recommend it without qualification, as long as you can handle not having Homekit.One other thing, though -- yes, the plate that comes with it is difficult to remove.

I have other Kasa smart plugs and so I was already using the app. It was incredibly easy to install and get this dimmer switch working right out of the box. It was much easier than the Z-wave to install and is more user friendly. The only con is the switch plate. Once it's installed, it's almost impossible to take off without breaking it. I haven't had to remove it yet, but when I do...

A cursory search for what type of dimmer I should get noted a distinction between leading (incandescent) and trailing (electronic) edge dimmers, but I didn’t see any information about this on this particular dimmer (nor on the bulbs I purchased). This dimmer is quite clearly labeled LED compatible.I don’t know if the bulbs were designed to work with the leading edge dimmers over trailing.. so who knows what’s going on. Seems like manufacturers are leaving out some critical information or aren’t adopting some form of standard.The buzzing does not occur at 100% ie no dimming, but there is a clear correlation between dimmer % and buzzing volume between 10-90%.The face plate is a PAIN to remove, as others have noted. Make sure everything is in the correct orientation before clicking back into place. The Kasa app walks you through installation steps. Relatively straightforward and has nice illustrations to guide you.One problem came up - I have the switch and my router on the same circuit breaker. You can’t view the installation steps unless you are connected to a wifi network (but only the very last step requires a wifi connection).I had to go back and forth between the next step and flipping the breaker. This added a lot of time to the install.###first<21:26>|instal<43:52>|today<58:63>|turn<84:89>|long<101:105>|run<106:109>|led<124:127>|lead<124:127>|compatible<128:138>|dimmer<145:151>|buzz<152:158>|lead<168:171>|led<168:171>|led light<168:178>|install<181:188>|instal<181:190>|search<202:208>|type<218:222>|dimmer<226:232>|note<246:251>|lead<274:281>|incandescent<283:295>|electronic<311:321>|edge<323:327>|dimmer<328:334>|dimmer<328:335>|form<360:364>|information<358:369>|particular<389:399>|dimmer<400:406>|bulb<419:424>|dimmer<444:450>|clear<460:465>|clearly<460:467>|label<468:475>|led<476:479>|lead<476:479>|compatible<480:490>|bulb<511:516>|design<522:530>|lead<548:555>|edge<556:560>|dimmer<561:567>|dimmer<561:568>|manufacturer<626:639>|leave<644:651>|critical<661:669>|form<672:676>|information<670:681>|form<706:710>|standard<714:722>|buzzing<727:734>|occur<744:749>|dimming<764:771>|clear<788:793>|dimmer<814:820>|buzzing<827:834>|volume<835:841>|face<861:865>|plate<866:871>|face plate<861:871>|a pain<875:881>|pain<877:881>|remove<885:891>|note<908:913>|correct<946:953>|click<973:981>|back<982:986>|place<992:997>|kasa<1003:1007>|kasa app<1003:1011>|the kasa app<999:1011>|walk<1012:1017>|install<1030:1037>|installation<1030:1042>|step<1043:1047>|step<1043:1048>|relatively<1050:1060>|straightforward<1061:1076>|guide<1107:1112>|problem<1121:1128>|router<1164:1170>|same<1178:1182>|circuit<1183:1190>|breaker<1191:1198>|circuit breaker<1183:1198>|install<1219:1226>|installation<1219:1231>|step<1232:1236>|step<1232:1237>|connect<1253:1262>|wifi<1268:1272>|wifi network<1268:1280>|network<1273:1280>|last<1300:1304>|step<1305:1309>|require<1310:1318>|wifi<1321:1325>|back<1350:1354>|forth<1359:1364>|next<1377:1381>|step<1382:1386>|next step<1377:1386>|flip<1391:1399>|breaker<1404:1411>|add<1418:1423>|install<1445:1452>",

      "Difficult to remove faceplate###difficult<0:9>|remove<13:19>|faceplate<20:29>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2021-07-04] <b>Installation required Googling but I am still happy with it</b> We have quite quite a few Kasa SmartPlugs in our home so I thought I would give this a try since our dining room dimmer switch needed replacing.First, the \"Good\":- This is working very well on an antique oil chandelier that was converted to electric many years ago, and has an LED bulb.  If it is working well for that, I would imagine it will work well for just about any light.- It integrates  well with Alexa.  I am sitting in the family room right now and via voice turned it on, dimmed it, and then turned it off.  As will other Kasa smart devices, you can set a schedule and turn it on/off remotely.- It has a nice, oversized faceplate which I really like because it keeps the wall around the plate cleaner since there is less chance for hand contact.The \"Not Good\":- The faceplate is very difficult to remove when you pull the product from the box.  You fear you are going to break it.- It is even more difficult to remove if you have it mounted to the wall and need to make a \"depth\" adjustment to get a really good flush mount to the wall.- There is little to know guidance from Kasa in the box or on the web about how to remove the faceplate more easily.  Most of what I found was from their help forum from other buyers who had the same question.Advisements that don't affect my review but could help you:- My old dimmer switch had wire \"leads\" that made connecting the red and black wires.  This Kasa does not, which required me to flatten and straighten them so as not to loose any wire length.  That requires some tools a just a bit of manual dexterity.  The advantage of no lead wires is having less wiring and fewer wire caps to push back into the wall once you are done.- My old dimmer also had no ground wire.  If you are not used to replacing light switches and don't know, don't skip this step and call an electrician if you are unsure about good grounding.- Speaking of calling an electrician:  This Kasa requires an additional white (neutral) wire to work.  Do no assume that  because you have shut off power to your red/black wires that power it is also off to your white wire.  Again, call an electrician if you are not sure, or at the very least use a voltage tester.###installation<3:15>|require<16:24>|red<21:24>|still<43:48>|happy<49:54>|kasa<93:97>|home<116:120>|give<142:146>|dining<168:174>|dining room<168:179>|room<175:179>|dimmer<180:186>|replace<201:210>|first<211:216>|hand<276:280>|chandelier<275:285>|convert<295:304>|electric<308:316>|many year<317:327>|year<322:327>|ago<328:331>|led<344:347>|led bulb<344:352>|bulb<348:352>|imagine<395:402>|integrate<451:461>|alexa<473:478>|sit<486:493>|family<501:507>|family room<501:512>|room<508:512>|now<519:522>|voice<531:536>|turn<537:541>|turn<537:543>|dim<551:557>|turn<571:575>|turn<571:577>|kasa<601:605>|smart<606:611>|device<612:619>|kasa smart device<601:619>|set<629:632>|schedule<635:643>|turn<648:652>|oversized<689:698>|plate<703:708>|faceplate<699:708>|keep<740:745>|wall<750:754>|plate<766:771>|clean<772:779>|less<795:799>|chance<800:806>|hand<811:815>|contact<816:823>|faceplate<845:854>|plate<849:854>|difficult<863:872>|remove<876:882>|pull<892:896>|box<918:921>|break<950:955>|difficult<977:986>|remove<990:996>|mount<1012:1017>|mount<1012:1019>|wall<1027:1031>|depth<1052:1057>|adjustment<1059:1069>|flush<1091:1096>|mount<1097:1102>|flush mount<1091:1102>|wall<1110:1114>|now<1137:1140>|kasa<1155:1159>|box<1167:1170>|web<1181:1184>|remove<1198:1204>|faceplate<1209:1218>|plate<1213:1218>|easily<1224:1230>|most<1233:1237>|find<1248:1253>|help<1269:1273>|forum<1274:1279>|buyer<1291:1297>|same<1310:1314>|question<1315:1323>|affect<1347:1353>|help<1374:1378>|old<1388:1391>|dimmer<1392:1398>|old dimmer switch<1388:1405>|wire<1410:1414>|lead<1416:1420>|lead<1416:1421>|connect<1433:1443>|red<1448:1451>|black<1456:1461>|wire<1462:1466>|wire<1462:1467>|black wire<1456:1467>|kasa<1475:1479>|red<1501:1504>|require<1496:1504>|loose<1552:1557>|wire<1562:1566>|length<1567:1573>|require<1581:1589>|tool<1595:1600>|manual<1617:1623>|lead<1656:1660>|wire<1661:1665>|wire<1661:1666>|less<1677:1681>|wiring<1682:1688>|wire<1699:1703>|cap<1704:1708>|push<1712:1716>|back<1717:1721>|wall<1731:1735>|old<1759:1762>|dimmer<1763:1769>|ground<1782:1788>|wire<1789:1793>|ground wire<1782:1793>|replace<1819:1828>|now<1855:1858>|skip<1866:1870>|step<1876:1880>|call<1885:1889>|electric<1893:1901>|electrician<1893:1904>|an electrician<1890:1904>|ground<1934:1940>|call<1958:1962>|call<1958:1965>|electric<1969:1977>|an electrician<1966:1980>|electrician<1969:1980>|kasa<1988:1992>|require<1993:2001>|additional<2005:2015>|white<2016:2021>|neutral<2023:2030>|neutral wire<2023:2036>|wire<2032:2036>|assume<2053:2059>|shut<2083:2087>|power<2092:2097>|red<2106:2109>|black<2110:2115>|wire<2116:2120>|wire<2116:2121>|black wire<2110:2121>|power<2127:2132>|white<2156:2161>|wire<2162:2166>|white wire<2156:2166>|again<2169:2174>|call<2176:2180>|electric<2184:2192>|an electrician<2181:2195>|electrician<2184:2195>|least<2232:2237>|voltage<2244:2251>",

I bought these so I can ask Alexa to turn off the lights when I start a movie. They are fairly easy to install, the app really walks you through everything. Make sure you have a voltage detector to find out the line and load wires. Also the faceplate came with the switch is a little tough to remove and a pain to put back on after you finish installing. I would recommend go buy some screw in faceplates rather than using the ones came with it. My Alexa app notified me of having new smart devices as soon as I set these up in the Kasa app. Great product, now considering changing all the switches in the house to Kasa.###dimmer<9:15>|easy<24:28>|install<32:39>|dimmer<67:73>|these dimmer switch<61:82>|ask<108:111>|alexa<112:117>|turn<121:125>|start<148:153>|movie<156:161>|fairly<172:178>|easy<179:183>|install<187:194>|walk<211:216>|voltage<262:269>|find<282:286>|line<295:299>|load<304:308>|load wire<304:314>|wire<309:314>|faceplate<325:334>|remove<377:383>|a pain<388:394>|pain<390:394>|put<398:401>|back<402:406>|finish<420:426>|install<427:434>|instal<427:437>|recommend<447:456>|screw<469:474>|faceplate<478:487>|faceplate<478:488>|one<511:515>|alexa<533:538>|new<565:568>|smart<569:574>|device<575:582>|soon<586:590>|set<596:599>|kasa<616:620>|the kasa app<612:624>|kasa app<616:624>|now<641:644>|consider<645:656>|change<657:665>|house<690:695>|kasa<699:703>",

It appears very well made, the dimmer range is excellent and doesnt make my LED bulbs flicker or any anomalies.Why 3 stars?1) No instruction on how to remove the faceplate.  And its very tightly held by small tabs. I thought the tabs were going to break when I tried to remove the faceplate so go easy.2) No wiring instruction inside the box either.  WTH?So how to wire it:Make sure you have a neutral wire (white wire).  Neutral wire is required for this switch to work properly.There are 5 connections.  2 wires sticking out of the switch, 2 terminals on the switch to hook up to, and one ground.Hook up the load wire / wire that hooks up to the LED bulbs to the terminal that has a red screw.Hook up the black power wire to the terminal on the switch with the black screw.Hook up the dimmer switch white wire to your house white wire.Hook up dimmer switch ground wire to your house ground wire.Now download the KASA app and follow the instructions on how to set up smart dimmer switch.I read a reviewer unhappy that the LED light on the switch itself is too bright.  They fixed that already and it is now very very dim.  I actually prefer that switch LED light indicator to be bright (personal preference) but the maker did not provide the ability to adjust the switch LED light indicator adjustment.Hope that helps some of you.###smart<13:18>|dim<19:22>|dimmer<19:25>|smart dimmer<13:25>|smart dimmer switch<13:32>|outstanding<54:65>|appear<71:78>|dim<99:102>|dimmer<99:105>|range<106:111>|led<144:147>|lead<144:147>|bulb<148:153>|led bulb<144:153>|flicker<154:161>|instruction<197:208>|remove<219:225>|faceplate<230:239>|hold<263:267>|small<271:276>|tab<277:281>|tab<297:301>|break<316:321>|remove<338:344>|faceplate<349:358>|wiring<376:382>|wiring instruction<376:394>|instruction<383:394>|box<406:409>|either<410:416>|wire<433:437>|neutral<462:469>|neutral wire<462:474>|wire<470:474>|a neutral wire<460:474>|white<476:481>|wire<482:486>|white wire<476:486>|neutral<490:497>|wire<498:502>|neutral wire<490:502>|require<506:514>|red<511:514>|properly<539:547>|connection<560:571>|wire<576:580>|wire<576:581>|stick<582:590>|terminal<612:620>|terminal<612:621>|hook<639:643>|ground<659:665>|hook<666:670>|load<678:682>|wire<683:687>|load wire<678:687>|wire<690:694>|hook<700:704>|hook<700:705>|lead<716:719>|led<716:719>|the led bulb<712:725>|bulb<720:725>|led bulb<716:725>|terminal<733:741>|red<753:756>|screw<757:762>|hook<763:767>|black<775:780>|power<781:786>|wire<787:791>|terminal<799:807>|black<831:836>|screw<837:842>|hook<843:847>|dim<855:858>|dimmer<855:861>|white<869:874>|wire<875:879>|white wire<869:879>|house<888:893>|white<894:899>|white wire<894:904>|wire<900:904>|hook<905:909>|dim<913:916>|dimmer<913:919>|ground<927:933>|ground wire<927:938>|wire<934:938>|house<947:952>|ground<953:959>|wire<960:964>|ground wire<953:964>|now<965:968>|download<969:977>|load<973:977>|kasa<982:986>|kasa app<982:990>|the kasa app<978:990>|follow<995:1001>|instruction<1006:1017>|instruction<1006:1018>|set<1029:1032>|smart<1036:1041>|dim<1042:1045>|dimmer<1042:1048>|smart dimmer<1036:1048>|smart dimmer switch<1036:1055>|read<1058:1062>|lead<1091:1094>|led<1091:1094>|bright<1129:1135>|fix<1143:1148>|read<1156:1160>|already<1154:1161>|now<1172:1175>|dim<1186:1189>|actually<1194:1202>|prefer<1203:1209>|lead<1222:1225>|led<1222:1225>|indicator<1232:1241>|bright<1248:1254>|prefer<1265:1271>|provide<1299:1306>|ability<1311:1318>|adjust<1322:1328>|lead<1340:1343>|led<1340:1343>|indicator<1350:1359>|adjust<1360:1366>|adjustment<1360:1370>|hope<1371:1375>|help<1381:1386>",

I googled YouTube videos to see if I was missing something with trying to remove it to install. I felt like I was going to break it, but it finally popped off after putting a flathead screwdriver behind it to pry it apart. Now that it is on the wall, I literally can not remove it again.

      "Faceplate fits tightly once installed###faceplate<0:9>|fit<10:14>|once<23:27>|instal<28:37>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2018-11-28] <b>Works great... once installed and setup</b> I really wanted to give this a 5 rating (or 4.5 if that was an option) but I went with 4 for two main reasons: installation and setup.  First though, let me say how well it has worked in the hours that I've been using it.  Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant are both controlling even better than I'd hoped.  It dims easily by voice commands, via all the apps for Alexa, Google Home and Kasa, and of course using the physical buttons on the switch.  I can dim it to pretty much any percentage that I want and, contrary to some of the answered questions I've seen, the switch remembers the last dimmer setting when it turns back on instead of full brightness.Here's where I avoided giving it that 5th star.  For the installation, the face plate came pre-assembled and was ridiculously difficult to remove in order to install the switch.  After several minutes of struggling, it finally came off but only after it cracked the plastic upper piece where it attaches to the the body of the switch.  Fortunately, it was not too damaged to properly install it and the crack was not visible since it is behind the face plate.  Kasa people: it's great that the face plate fits so tightly once completely installed, but please don't pre-assemble it in the box if it is going to be such a challenge.  Once installed the switch worked perfectly as a standalone unit, but then the setup via the Kasa app took a dozen or so attempts before the device could finally be discovered over Wifi.  That was very aggravating.  I've got both 2.4g and 5g networks and tried using one or the other to see if that was the issue but it didn't seem to make any difference.  Additionally, this device is closer to my router than an existing Kasa non-dimmer smart switch and my phone was literally just inches away from the device, so those helpful hints on how to resolve it were not helping at all.In the end, it was well worth the money and minimal trouble.  I love that it does not require a hub like other products which I won't name and I'm happy that I chose this Kasa product instead.  I only wish I'd bought two of them at the great price offered during Cyber Monday...###once<18:22>|all<27:30>|install<23:30>|instal<23:32>|setup<37:42>|all<51:54>|give<66:70>|option<110:116>|an option<107:116>|main<144:148>|reason<149:156>|all<162:165>|install<158:165>|installation<158:170>|setup<175:180>|first<183:188>|though<189:195>|let<197:200>|hour<238:243>|amazon alexa<270:282>|alexa<277:282>|google<287:293>|assistant<294:303>|google assistant<287:303>|control<313:324>|hope<346:351>|dim<357:360>|dim<357:361>|easily<362:368>|voice<372:377>|command<378:386>|voice command<372:386>|all<392:395>|alexa<409:414>|google<416:422>|home<423:427>|google home<416:427>|kasa<432:436>|course<445:451>|physical<462:470>|physical button<462:478>|button<471:478>|dim<501:504>|pre<511:514>|pretty<511:517>|percentage<527:537>|answer<579:587>|question<588:597>|remember<620:629>|last<634:638>|dim<639:642>|dimmer<639:645>|set<646:653>|turn<662:667>|back<668:672>|instead<676:683>|full<687:691>|brightness<692:702>|full brightness<687:702>|avoid<718:725>|give<726:732>|all<764:767>|install<760:767>|installation<760:772>|face<778:782>|the face plate<774:788>|plate<783:788>|face plate<778:788>|pre<794:797>|difficult<829:838>|remove<842:848>|all<865:868>|install<861:868>|minute<896:903>|struggle<907:917>|all<925:928>|finally<922:929>|last<970:974>|plastic<969:976>|upper<977:982>|piece<983:988>|attach<998:1006>|body<1018:1022>|damage<1067:1074>|properly<1078:1086>|all<1091:1094>|install<1087:1094>|visible<1120:1127>|face<1151:1155>|plate<1156:1161>|the face plate<1147:1161>|face plate<1151:1161>|kasa<1164:1168>|people<1169:1175>|face<1197:1201>|plate<1202:1207>|face plate<1197:1207>|the face plate<1193:1207>|fit<1208:1212>|once<1224:1228>|let<1233:1236>|completely<1229:1239>|install<1240:1247>|all<1244:1247>|instal<1240:1249>|pre<1268:1271>|box<1291:1294>|all<1325:1328>|challenge<1323:1332>|once<1335:1339>|install<1340:1347>|all<1344:1347>|instal<1340:1349>|perfectly<1368:1377>|unit<1394:1398>|setup<1413:1418>|kasa<1427:1431>|the kasa app<1423:1435>|kasa app<1427:1435>|dozen<1443:1448>|a dozen<1441:1448>|attempt<1455:1463>|device<1475:1481>|all<1491:1494>|finally<1488:1495>|discover<1499:1509>|wifi<1515:1519>|network<1576:1584>|issue<1641:1646>|difference<1678:1688>|all<1699:1702>|additionally<1691:1703>|device<1710:1716>|close<1720:1726>|router<1733:1739>|exist<1748:1756>|kasa<1757:1761>|non<1762:1765>|dim<1766:1769>|dimmer<1766:1772>|smart<1773:1778>|phone<1793:1798>|all<1808:1811>|literally<1803:1812>|away<1825:1829>|device<1839:1845>|helpful<1856:1863>|resolve<1880:1887>|help<1900:1907>|all<1911:1914>|end<1922:1925>|worth<1939:1944>|money<1949:1954>|minimal<1959:1966>|trouble<1967:1974>|love<1979:1983>|require<2001:2008>|hub<2011:2014>|name<2049:2053>|happy<2062:2067>|choose<2075:2080>|kasa<2086:2090>|instead<2099:2106>|wish<2116:2120>|price<2157:2162>|great price<2151:2162>|offer<2163:2170>"

      "Springy feel without tactile click###feel<8:12>|tactile<21:28>|click<29:34>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★★ [2021-04-30] <b>Very happy to have this installed.</b> I'm using a set of string lights with 15 3.5W dimmable LED bulbs (52.5W total) as the main lighting in my living room and for years I was using a Lutron on-cord sliding dimmer.  It worked, but the dimming range was very limited and the lights would flicker and/or surge when dimmed.  I wanted a proper dimming switch but the lights are just plugged into an outlet and run up the wall to the ceiling.I ended up installing this switch in a single gang surface-mount box using an extension cord that I cut the female end off of to feed the switch and then the cord to the string lights (with the plug cut off) exiting the switch.  Now I have a proper switch to turn the lights on mounted to the wall just inside my door, with the added bonus of being able to control it from my phone.  The range of dimming is much better than what I had before and there is no more flickering or surging at any level.I do wish would be that the switch itself had more of a tactile feel; it has a springy feel to it, but more of a 'click' would be nice.  Also, it would be nice if you could push either the top or bottom of the switch to activate (it's just the bottom for on & off).  It's just a \"what you're used to\" thing, I'm still very happy with this switch.###happy<8:13>|instal<27:36>|set<54:57>|string<61:67>|string light<61:74>|dimmable<88:96>|able<92:96>|dimmable led<88:100>|led<97:100>|bulb<101:106>|led bulb<97:106>|dimmable led bulb<88:106>|total<114:119>|main<128:132>|lighting<133:141>|living<148:154>|living room<148:159>|room<155:159>|year<168:173>|lutron<188:194>|cord<198:202>|dimmer<211:217>|dim<239:246>|dimming<239:246>|range<247:252>|limited<262:269>|flicker<291:298>|surge<306:311>|dim<317:323>|proper<337:343>|dimming<344:351>|dim<344:351>|plug<383:387>|plug<383:390>|outlet<399:405>|run<410:413>|wall<421:425>|ceiling<433:440>|end<443:446>|end<443:448>|instal<452:462>|single<480:486>|a single gang<478:491>|single gang<480:491>|gang<487:491>|surface<492:499>|mount<500:505>|box<506:509>|extension<519:528>|cord<529:533>|cut<541:544>|end<556:559>|cord<599:603>|string<611:617>|string light<611:624>|plug<635:639>|cut<640:643>|now<670:673>|proper<683:689>|turn<700:704>|mount<719:724>|mount<719:726>|wall<734:738>|door<754:758>|add<769:774>|bonus<775:780>|able<790:794>|control<798:805>|phone<817:822>|range<829:834>|dimming<838:845>|dim<838:845>|flicker<905:912>|flickering<905:915>|surge<919:926>|level<934:939>|wish<945:949>|tactile<996:1003>|feel<1004:1008>|feel<1027:1031>|click<1054:1059>|push<1113:1117>|top<1129:1132>|bottom<1136:1142>|activate<1160:1168>|bottom<1184:1190>|still<1252:1257>|happy<1263:1268>",

I like my Amazon Basics switch that's in the kitchen better.The setup is awkward because on my unit at least the built-in WiFi used for setup stops responding to connection requests after the unit has been on for a wile. A solution to this is to use the reset button immediately before starting the pairing process.The manual switch function is very slow to respond and overall inferior to the Amazon Basics switch I have. The click of the internal button is not as crisp.The lowest dimmer setting is much brighter than the old analog dimmer switch would go to, so it's not the bulbs (100W equivalent LED). In fact, for a dining room table, which mine is used for, it's just not good at all. Someone might want to have bright bulbs as I do while still having a low brightness setting available.###setup<3:8>|manual<18:24>|slow<32:36>|low<33:36>|low<38:41>|low<38:44>|dimmer<45:51>|set<52:59>|setting<52:59>|bright<64:70>|overall<75:82>|all<79:82>|kitchen<143:150>|setup<162:167>|unit<193:197>|least<201:206>|build<211:216>|wifi<220:224>|setup<234:239>|stop<240:245>|respond<246:253>|respond<246:256>|connection<260:270>|request<271:279>|unit<290:294>|solution<321:329>|reset<352:357>|the reset button<348:364>|reset button<352:364>|button<358:364>|immediately<365:376>|start<384:392>|pairing<397:404>|process<405:412>|manual<417:423>|function<431:439>|low<449:452>|slow<448:452>|respond<456:463>|all<472:475>|overall<468:475>|click<525:530>|internal<538:546>|button<547:553>|low<574:577>|low<574:580>|dimmer<581:587>|set<588:595>|setting<588:595>|bright<604:610>|bright<604:612>|old<622:625>|analog<626:632>|dimmer<633:639>|analog dimmer<626:639>|bulb<676:681>|equivalent<688:698>|led<699:702>|fact<708:712>|dining<720:726>|dining room<720:731>|room<727:731>|all<785:788>|bright<817:823>|bulb<824:829>|still<844:849>|low<859:862>|bright<863:869>|brightness<863:873>|setting<874:881>|set<874:881>|available<882:891>",

So the integration with your wife, literally a cake walk. I’ve not seen any other gadget so seamless to integrate with your home with. Awesome.However, I do have one uneasy feeling. The share of their buttons is not that user friendly or aesthetic. It looks too bland. My old parents are not phone friendly so they end of using the switch physically and it’s not apparent to them if it turned on or off ;) Being an engineers/entrepreneur with multiple startups (successful exits and top notch products 😎), I can tell you that this can be done. Is this the major failure? Probably not if y’all are all phone users but for me with my lovely old parents, a big yes!Overall, I like this brand and bought few more things.

They are easy to control, have a nice solid feel when you press them, and I really like the glow they emit when off so you can find them in the dark. My only complaint is that these dimmers were very hard to fit into the electrical box when I installed them. They were standard ganged metal boxes (3 ganged together) and the contour of them interlocking parts interfered with the switch housing. I eventually made it work by swapping the 2 dimmers around with the 1 single pole I was putting in, but it was a major headache. Would be nice if Kasa gave a little more wiggle room on the housing. Even swapping boxes out wouldn't have helped since the issue was height and not depth. But now they're in and I'm very happy.###tight<16:21>|a tight fit<14:25>|tight fit<16:25>|fit<22:25>|box<33:36>|kasa<55:59>|dimmer<75:81>|these dimmer switch<69:90>|exception<98:107>|easy<118:122>|control<126:133>|solid<147:152>|feel<153:157>|press<167:172>|glow<201:205>|find<236:240>|dark<253:257>|complaint<267:276>|only complaint<262:276>|dimmer<291:297>|dimmer<291:298>|hard<309:313>|fit<317:320>|electrical<330:340>|box<341:344>|electrical box<330:344>|the electrical box<326:344>|instal<352:361>|standard<378:386>|gang<387:393>|metal<394:399>|box<400:403>|metal box<394:405>|box<400:405>|gang<409:415>|together<416:424>|part<463:468>|interfere<469:479>|housing<496:503>|eventually<507:517>|swap<534:542>|dimmer<549:555>|dimmer<549:556>|single<575:581>|single pole<575:586>|pole<582:586>|put<593:600>|major<618:623>|headache<624:632>|kasa<651:655>|give<656:660>|room<682:686>|housing<694:701>|swap<708:716>|box<717:720>|box<717:722>|help<741:747>|issue<758:763>|depth<783:788>|now<794:797>|happy<822:827>"

      "Buttons not slightly illuminated###button<0:7>|slightly<12:20>|||B08RSM1KYN ★☆☆☆☆ [2021-06-01] <b>Leviton needs to go back to the drawing board (review written by a technician)</b> A review is sometimes only as good as the experience of the person who is leaving it.  For this reason, I often ignore some reviews and give much more weight to others.  I will begin by saying that I have over 20 years experience as a computer technician and have a family full of people who work in trades (plumbing, heating, air conditioning, and electric) so my home network and my electrical system are in solid working order.  I have a wireless mesh network blanketing my property and there are no dead spots anywhere in my house.  Here is my review of this item:(1) Ergonomics.  Unlike other switches, this Leviton switch is a completely smooth, flat, featureless plastic surface.  It is impossible to reliably locate the on button in complete darkness - it is exactly the same as the off button.  While you can talk to it (and that has its own issues), the buttons should be easy to locate with your eyes closed and should be slightly illuminated so that you can see it but not be annoyed by it.(2) Connectivity.  As you will see in other reviews dating back to 2017, the devices bings and bongs, bleeps and beeps, randomly and annoyingly throughout the day and night.  It disconnects from the internet whenever it feels like it.  My wireless access points are not more than 20 feet away and not one of my 4 Leviton switches can maintain a solid connection.  The Tp-Link Kasa switch that is directly next to it has zero connectivity issues, and all my mobile devices have no issues with the home wifi.  Leviton's response to my email is that the wifi is getting affected by the fact that it is installed in a metal box with a metal cover.  \"Unfortunately, for wireless in-wall devices, metal wall boxes or metal wall plates typically attenuate the signal, so even if connected, it could be intermittent. While we recognize that it is difficult to change a metal wall box, if you can, we recommend using Leviton Decora wall plates.\"  If this is true, then why aren't the competitors' smart switches affected by the metal?  As you can see in my photo, the Tp-Link Kasa switch is right next to the Leviton switch and has never had any connectivity issues.(3) Lighting Performance.  To dim or brighten the lights, you must hold down the power on or off buttons.  It makes the job very imprecise.  In addition, every Leviton switch produces an audible hum over the internal speaker whenever the dimmer is used (I have halogen as well as LED bulb fixtures and it happens on all of them).  Maybe because it is so compact, Leviton needs to shield the internal speaker from the feedback of the dimmer.  I do not know why it happens but it happens on all four of mine.(4) Smart Home Performance.  Occasionally, I will tell Alexa to turn on the lights, she will say \"OK\", and nothing will happen.  I tell her to turn them off, she says \"OK\", and nothing happens.  I then have to completely reset the switch and join it to my Alexa network.  I have never had to do this with my Alexa Echo or my cheaper switches from Leviton's competitors.  Other times, I will send it a voice command and it will stutter and lock up.  When I try to use the switch to \"drop in\" on another Alexa device, it completely locks up the device and says \"Calling with Alexa is not supp...Calling with Alexa is not supp...Calling with Alexa is not supp...\" in a loop.  Leviton says it is a known bug.  Leviton has now informed me that using the switch to make a call is not supported, even though it has both a mic and a speaker and is connected to Alexa.  Um... why not?Bottom LineIf you expect this to be an Alexa Echo inside your wall, it is not and it probably never will be.  If you expect it to do its job as a dimmable light switch, it will do a poor job of it when compared to switches that are a quarter of the price.  If Amazon is your smart home platform of choice, buy an Alexa Echo for half the price of this switch and you will get all the features along with some decent quality speakers.  Then, buy your remaining switches from Tp-Link Kasa (pictured in the photo) or another capable manufacturer to round out your smart home purchase.

The bulbs were rated as dimmable but too bright for the TV room.  So, a dimmer switch was needed.  And since I needed a dimmer for other LED bulbs around the house, the 3-pack was perfect and just a little more than buying 2 switches separately.  I have all my switches integrated with Alexa automation and I like this control better at the switch than having to control each individual light (i.e. smart bulbs).  This automation also allows me to turn the house lights on and off during vacations so the house seems occupied when away.  I do the same with smart plugs.Just be aware of a couple of things.  First, the body of the switch is very big and bulky, as are all other smart switches.  This means it's going to be a tight fit in the electrical box and you've got some maneuvering ahead of you if you have a few wires and wire nuts in the box.  It also means you need a deep box if you're installing more than one of these in the same box.  So you may need a qualified electrician if you're not comfortable with electricity.  Second, the switch itself is a single tap vs. an on/off click.  This is necessary because of the smart capability (the electronics can't physically click the switch on/off).  It's not a big deal and you get used to it very quickly.All in all, a great buy and they do work very well with Alexa integration via wireless.  And yes, the switches still work even if the wireless is out.  You just have to manually turn them on and off.###integrate<3:13>|smoothly<14:22>|alexa<28:33>|bright<72:78>|brightness<72:82>|new<88:91>|all<96:99>|instal<92:101>|ceiling<102:109>|ceiling fan<102:114>|fan<110:114>|led<122:125>|led bulb<122:131>|bulb<126:131>|bulb<138:143>|rate<149:154>|dimmable<158:166>|bright<175:181>|tv<190:192>|room<193:197>|dimmer<206:212>|dimmer<254:260>|led<271:274>|bulb<275:280>|led bulb<271:280>|house<292:297>|pack<305:309>|3 pack<303:309>|separately<368:378>|all<388:391>|rate<409:414>|integrate<404:414>|alexa<420:425>|automation<426:436>|control<453:460>|control<497:504>|individual<510:520>|smart<533:538>|bulb<539:544>|automation<553:563>|all<569:572>|allow<569:575>|turn<582:586>|house<591:596>|vacation<622:631>|house<639:644>|away<665:669>|same<681:685>|smart<691:696>|plug<697:702>|smart plug<691:702>|aware<711:716>|couple<722:728>|a couple<720:728>|first<741:746>|body<752:756>|big<779:782>|bulky<787:792>|all<801:804>|smart<811:816>|other smart switch<805:825>|mean<833:838>|tight<858:863>|fit<864:867>|tight fit<858:867>|a tight fit<856:867>|electrical<875:885>|box<886:889>|the electrical box<871:889>|electrical box<875:889>|ahead<922:927>|wire<953:957>|wire<953:958>|wire<963:967>|wire nut<963:972>|nut<968:972>|box<980:983>|mean<994:999>|deep<1011:1015>|box<1016:1019>|all<1034:1037>|instal<1030:1040>|same<1071:1075>|box<1076:1079>|the same box<1067:1079>|electrician<1110:1121>|comfortable<1136:1147>|electricity<1153:1164>|second<1167:1173>|single<1198:1204>|single tap<1198:1208>|tap<1205:1208>|click<1223:1228>|necessary<1239:1248>|smart<1264:1269>|capability<1270:1280>|electronic<1286:1297>|all<1310:1313>|physically<1304:1314>|click<1315:1320>|big<1353:1356>|big deal<1353:1361>|a big deal<1351:1361>|deal<1357:1361>|quickly<1390:1397>|all<1398:1401>|all<1405:1408>|alexa<1454:1459>|integration<1460:1471>|alexa integration<1454:1471>|wire<1476:1480>|wireless<1476:1484>|still<1509:1514>|wire<1532:1536>|wireless<1532:1540>|all<1571:1574>|manually<1567:1575>|turn<1576:1580>",
      "Buttons not easily locatable in darkness###button<0:7>|easily<12:18>|||B08RSM1KYN ★☆☆☆☆ [2021-06-01] <b>Leviton needs to go back to the drawing board (review written by a technician)</b> A review is sometimes only as good as the experience of the person who is leaving it.  For this reason, I often ignore some reviews and give much more weight to others.  I will begin by saying that I have over 20 years experience as a computer technician and have a family full of people who work in trades (plumbing, heating, air conditioning, and electric) so my home network and my electrical system are in solid working order.  I have a wireless mesh network blanketing my property and there are no dead spots anywhere in my house.  Here is my review of this item:(1) Ergonomics.  Unlike other switches, this Leviton switch is a completely smooth, flat, featureless plastic surface.  It is impossible to reliably locate the on button in complete darkness - it is exactly the same as the off button.  While you can talk to it (and that has its own issues), the buttons should be easy to locate with your eyes closed and should be slightly illuminated so that you can see it but not be annoyed by it.(2) Connectivity.  As you will see in other reviews dating back to 2017, the devices bings and bongs, bleeps and beeps, randomly and annoyingly throughout the day and night.  It disconnects from the internet whenever it feels like it.  My wireless access points are not more than 20 feet away and not one of my 4 Leviton switches can maintain a solid connection.  The Tp-Link Kasa switch that is directly next to it has zero connectivity issues, and all my mobile devices have no issues with the home wifi.  Leviton's response to my email is that the wifi is getting affected by the fact that it is installed in a metal box with a metal cover.  \"Unfortunately, for wireless in-wall devices, metal wall boxes or metal wall plates typically attenuate the signal, so even if connected, it could be intermittent. While we recognize that it is difficult to change a metal wall box, if you can, we recommend using Leviton Decora wall plates.\"  If this is true, then why aren't the competitors' smart switches affected by the metal?  As you can see in my photo, the Tp-Link Kasa switch is right next to the Leviton switch and has never had any connectivity issues.(3) Lighting Performance.  To dim or brighten the lights, you must hold down the power on or off buttons.  It makes the job very imprecise.  In addition, every Leviton switch produces an audible hum over the internal speaker whenever the dimmer is used (I have halogen as well as LED bulb fixtures and it happens on all of them).  Maybe because it is so compact, Leviton needs to shield the internal speaker from the feedback of the dimmer.  I do not know why it happens but it happens on all four of mine.(4) Smart Home Performance.  Occasionally, I will tell Alexa to turn on the lights, she will say \"OK\", and nothing will happen.  I tell her to turn them off, she says \"OK\", and nothing happens.  I then have to completely reset the switch and join it to my Alexa network.  I have never had to do this with my Alexa Echo or my cheaper switches from Leviton's competitors.  Other times, I will send it a voice command and it will stutter and lock up.  When I try to use the switch to \"drop in\" on another Alexa device, it completely locks up the device and says \"Calling with Alexa is not supp...Calling with Alexa is not supp...Calling with Alexa is not supp...\" in a loop.  Leviton says it is a known bug.  Leviton has now informed me that using the switch to make a call is not supported, even though it has both a mic and a speaker and is connected to Alexa.  Um... why not?Bottom LineIf you expect this to be an Alexa Echo inside your wall, it is not and it probably never will be.  If you expect it to do its job as a dimmable light switch, it will do a poor job of it when compared to switches that are a quarter of the price.  If Amazon is your smart home platform of choice, buy an Alexa Echo for half the price of this switch and you will get all the features along with some decent quality speakers.  Then, buy your remaining switches from Tp-Link Kasa (pictured in the photo) or another capable manufacturer to round out your smart home purchase.  I had high hopes for these switches but they are all being returned after 2 months of struggling to make them work.###leviton<3:10>|back<23:27>|board<43:48>|write<57:64>|sometimes<98:107>|experience<128:138>|person<146:152>|leave<160:167>|reason<182:188>|often<192:197>|ignore<198:204>|give<222:226>|begin<263:268>|year<299:304>|experience<305:315>|computer<321:329>|family<352:358>|full<359:363>|people<367:373>|electric<435:443>|home<451:455>|network<456:463>|electric<471:479>|electrical<471:481>|system<482:488>|solid<496:501>|working<502:509>|wireless<527:535>|mesh<536:540>|network<541:548>|mesh

      "buttons feel a bit flimsy when pressing###button<0:7>|feel<8:12>|flimsy<19:25>|press<31:39>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★☆☆ [2024-02-04] <b>High latency and missing Matter support</b> I replaced a regular switch with this one, so I can control multiple lamps instead of just one.  One lamp is connected to the wired plug and the rest are connected to Leviton smart plugs. I use Android and Google Home.Pros:- Decent look- Easy installation- Easy configuration in Leviton appCons:- Buttons feel a bit flimsy when pressing them- Horrible latency (sometimes multiple seconds before light responds to switch)Switch has a simple, modern look and installation is easy, provided you have a neutral wire and enough room in the switch box (it can be a tight fit). The switch was easy to connect to Wi-Fi and configure with the Leviton app. The bottom button controls the wired light switch and the remaining buttons can be programmed to control other devices. There are a decent number of options, but I just have each button programmed to \"toggle one device\", which are the Leviton smart plugs used for my lamps. While you can program a button to set multiple devices to a particular state, there is no option to toggle multiple devices on or off with the same button. However, this is something that can be achieved by creating automations through other services. For example, I set up a routine in Google Home to keep one light switch in sync with another, so when one goes on or off, the other does as well.Not surprisingly, since this is a Wi-Fi switch, the biggest problem is latency. When I push a button, I assume the signal has to go out through the internet to Leviton servers and back to turn on my Wi-Fi smart plug. Most of the time, this takes around 1 to 2 seconds, which is just enough time to be annoying. Sometimes, when the connection is bad, nothing will happen at all when you push a button, and if you keep pressing it, the commands can queue up, leading to a bunch of light flickering when they finally make it through.I assume there is not really a solution to the latency problem until this device can be updated with Matter support. I contacted Leviton, and they said Matter support is planned, but there is no timeline. It's a shame, because the latency problem is really the only thing keeping this from being a 5-star device for me. In the meantime, waiting a few seconds for the lights to turn on is still better than having to walk across to room to turn them on at the source. Maybe people using Apple HomeKit will have a better experience.###high<3:7>|latency<8:15>|miss<20:27>|matter<28:34>|matter support<28:42>|support<35:42>|replace<49:57>|regular<60:67>|a regular switch<58:74>|one<85:88>|control<99:106>|multiple<107:115>|lamp<116:120>|lamp<116:121>|instead<122:129>|one<138:141>|one<144:147>|lamp<148:152>|connect<156:163>|connect<156:165>|wire<173:177>|wired<173:178>|plug<179:183>|rest<192:196>|the rest<188:196>|connect<201:208>|connect<201:210>|leviton<214:221>|smart<222:227>|plug<228:232>|smart plug<222:232>|smart plug<222:233>|leviton smart plug<214:233>|plug<228:233>|android<241:248>|google<253:259>|home<260:264>|google home<253:264>|decent<272:278>|easy<285:289>|all<294:297>|installation<290:302>|easy<304:308>|configuration<309:322>|leviton<326:333>|leviton app<326:337>|feel<352:356>|flimsy<363:369>|press<375:383>|latency<399:406>|sometimes<408:417>|multiple<418:426>|second<427:434>|respond<448:456>|simple<480:486>|modern<488:494>|modern look<488:499>|all<508:511>|installation<504:516>|easy<520:524>|provide<526:534>|neutral<546:553>|a neutral wire<544:558>|wire<554:558>|neutral wire<546:558>|room<570:574>|box<589:592>|tight<606:611>|fit<612:615>|a tight fit<604:615>|tight fit<606:615>|easy<633:637>|connect<641:648>|wi<652:654>|fi<655:657>|wi fi<652:657>|configure<662:671>|leviton<681:688>|the leviton app<677:692>|leviton app<681:692>|bottom<698:704>|button<705:711>|control<712:719>|control<712:720>|wire<725:729>|wired<725:730>|remain<752:761>|button<762:768>|button<762:769>|program<777:784>|program<777:787>|control<791:798>|device<805:811>|device<805:812>|decent<826:832>|number<833:839>|option<843:849>|option<843:850>|button<873:879>|program<880:887>|program<880:890>|toggle<895:901>|one<902:905>|device<906:912>|leviton<929:936>|smart<937:942>|smart plug<937:947>|plug<943:947>|smart plug<937:948>|plug<943:948>|leviton smart plug<929:948>|lamp<961:965>|lamp<961:966>|program<982:989>|button<992:998>|set<1002:1005>|multiple<1006:1014>|device<1015:1021>|device<1015:1022>|particular<1028:1038>|state<1039:1044>|option<1058:1064>|toggle<1068:1074>|multiple<1075:1083>|device<1084:1090>|device<1084:1091>|same<1111:1115>|button<1116:1122>|however<1124:1131>|create<1175:1183>|automation<1184:1195>|service<1210:1218>|example<1224:1231>|set<1235:1238>|routine<1244:1251>|google<1255:1261>|home<1262:1266>|google home<1255:1266>|keep<1270:1274>|one<1275:1278>|sync<1295:1299>|one<1322:1325>|wi<1399:1401>|a wi fi<1397:1404>|fi<1402:1404>|wi fi<1399:1404>|wi fi switch<1399:1411>|big<1417:1424>|problem<1425:1432>|latency<1436:1443>|push<1452:1456>|button<1459:1465>|assume<1469:1475>|signal<1480:1486>|internet<1513:1521>|leviton<1525:1532>|server<1533:1540>|back<1545:1549>|turn<1553:1557>|wi<1564:1566>|fi<1567:1569>|wi fi<1564:1569>|smart<1570:1575>|smart plug<1570:1580>|plug<1576:1580>|most<1582:1586>|second<1625:1632>|2 second<1623:1632>|annoying<1666:1674>|sometimes<1676:1685>|connect<1696:1703>|connection<1696:1706>|happen<1728:1734>|all<1738:1741>|push<1751:1755>|button<1758:1764>|keep<1777:1781>|press<1782:1790>|command<1799:1807>|queue<1812:1817>|lead<1822:1829>|a bunch<1833:1840>|bunch<1835:1840>|flickering<1850:1860>|light flickering<1844:1860>|all<1874:1877>|finally<1871:1878>|assume<1897:1903>|all<1919:1922>|solution<1926:1934>|latency<1942:1949>|problem<1950:1957>|device<1969:1975>|update<1983:1990>|matter<1996:2002>|matter support<1996:2010>|support<2003:2010>|contact<2014:2023>|leviton<2024:2031>|matter<2047:2053>|matter support<2047:2061>|support<2054:2061>|plan<2065:2072>|shame<2107:2112>|a shame<2105:2112>|latency<2126:2133>|problem<2134:2141>|all<2147:2150>|keep<2167:2171>|keep<2167:2174>|5 star<2193:2199>|device<2200:2206>|wait<2232:2239>|second<2246:2253>|few second<2242:2253>|a few second<2240:2253>|turn<2272:2276>|still<2283:2288>|walk<2311:2315>|across<2316:2322>|room<2326:2330>|turn<2334:2338>|source<2354:2360>|people<2368:2374>|apple<2381:2386>|home<2387:2391>|apple homekit<2381:2394>|homekit<2387:2394>|experience<2414:2424>",

It arrived missing a small screw used to secure the plate under the faceplate. The most glaring issue I have had is that it doesn't connect to my Amazon Alexa. I have spent an hour with Amazon support and an hour with Kasa support, and neither could help me. The switch and dimming features work as does the app, but it does not connect with Alexa. First world problem I know, but that was a key factor in my purchase of this product. I may decide to send it back and possibly get a new one, but as of right now I am thinking of spending a bit more money to get what I am sure is a better product.

      "Doesn't stick out or lean when switched on/off###stick<8:13>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★★☆ [2021-07-09] <b>Used for nearly every switch in my house.</b> I have some version of these switches controlling nearly everything in my house.  I started replacing my switches a few years ago with the Gen1 switches and just recently finished out with the Gen2.  The only switches that aren't these are my bathroom exhaust fans.  I've written quite a lot here so congrats if you make it through to the end.The switches I have in use now are:DW6HD (Gen1 600W Dimmer)DW1KD (1000W Dimmer, Gen1 but still uses leads instead of screws)DW15S (Gen1 Switch)DW4SF (Gen1 4 Speed Fan Controller, also uses leads over screws)D26HD (Gen2 600W Dimmer)D215S (Gen2 Switch)DAWDC (Gen2 wireless dimmer companion)DAWSC (Gen2 wireless switch companion)Overall I am very happy with my switches.  I have not had issues with constant dropping as some have said here.  The app works well and I really like the Away feature in it though the same can be accomplished through Alexa.  Integration with Alexa works fine.  Alexa usually picks up a new switch and let's me know it's connected before I can finish entering the name I want for the device.  That's not an issue as it updates automatically once I enter the name I like.  They also integrate well with Samsung SmartThings.  I use that as I was accidentally sent some ZWave Leviton switches when I ordered WiFi ones so I put them to use rather than throwing them away as Amazon suggested.  I also really like that for anyone visiting they work just as you'd expect a normal switch to vs using something like smart bulbs where if the power gets cut things can go a bit funny.  My OCD also likes that these don't stick out/lean one way or the other when switched on/off.  They're very unassuming looking which to me is good.My house is only a few years old, none of the switch boxes are metal and just about everywhere has a neutral wire already in the box.  The only places I had issues were in some of the 3-way switches where whoever wired the house seemed to cut some corners and didn't run all the wiring these require, along with not keeping things in their standard place (e.g. red wire hot, black wire traveler, etc.)  so for a while some of my 3-way switches weren't 3-way.  The Gen2 wireless switch companions remedied this though.Like many others, in general I prefer the screw terminals.  However, there were a couple of instances where having the leads was handy.  For the neutral wire I did like using the lead as it is more flexible than cutting a piece of 14/2 and using that.  In my kitchen dual gang box, which was very crowded even before I changed the switches, it did actually save me some space as I could get rid of the extra rigid wiring and use the existing wire nut already in the box on the house neutrals so I wasn't adding anything.  The other instance I preferred the leads was in a bedroom.  Whoever wired the boxes liked to strip a portion of the hot wire, loop that around the hot terminal on the switch and then terminate the hot wire on the second switch in the box rather than using a wire nut with two leads coming off of it.  Both switches were connected on a continuous hot wire.  I was able to cut the wire down to the stripped part and then just nut both switch hot/black wires to the house hot wire.  The looping method they used is a pain with the screw terminals on the Gen1, but I've made it work before.  The leads made that easier however, overall I would prefer the screw terminals.The wireless switch/dimmer companions are awesome.  They solved my 3-way wiring issue and are super easy to setup.  I was afraid there may be some delay after pushing the rocker, but it's an instant response.  If you're using Gen2 switches and wish you had a 3-way light somewhere you don't these make a really easy fix for that especially since you can stick them to a bare wall with the included adhesive pads.  Hopefully the battery life lives up to the stated 5 years, but I won't hold my breath.I also really like the fan controllers.  I have pull chain ceiling fans without remotes in all bedrooms and the living room and these make it really to control the fan speed either with the switch itself, voice, or an app.  Much better than my short wife trying to stand on something to pull the chain.Gen1 vs Gen2As stated above, overall I like the screw terminals better than the leads on the Gen 2.Updating the switch firmware is easier on Gen2.  In the My Leviton app you can choose to Update All Gen2 switches at once.  For Gen1 switches you have to do them individually still.  Gets old fast when you have a lot of them.  The addition of the wireless switch companions for Gen2 is great.  I don't use Apple Homekit so I can't speak to how Gen2 works there.ISSUESMost of the issues I've encountered have been more the fault of the house wiring or some other external factor rather than an issue with any of the switches themselves, but they're not without fault.-- Some LED bulbs just don't play nice with the dimmers.  Maybe this is my fault for trying the less expensive bulbs, but I've noticed the EcoSmart from Home Depot don't always dim very well.  Other brands work better, but I have yet to find an LED bulb/switch combo that gives 1) the dimming range or 2) dimming smoothness and 3) no flicker on dimmer settings than 100% of an incandescent bulb.  You can get one or two, but not all 3.-- I have had some disconnects.  I haven't had enough that I'd call it unusable or a deal breaker, but it happens. Most things with wifi will sometimes drop.  This is much easier to deal with on the dimmer switches since you can pull out the bottom dimmer rocker and it cuts power to the switch effectively letting you reset its connection.  I wish the plain switches had something similar where I could cut their power without having to flip a breaker.  Honestly, when a non-dimmer isn't connected I don't do anything.  It'll eventually reconnect but sometimes it's a day and sometimes it's a few days.  If there was an easily accessible reset button on the plain switch that would make things so much easier.--  I have had 1 switch (out of 26) just up and die on me... so far any way.  It was in my super crowded kitchen dual gang box which I think contributed to its death.  However, and this is a plus, Leviton support was great.  They walked me through some steps (which I had already tried, but I understand they need to check their boxes) and then they sent me a new switch.  It was all handled very well, no run around or anything.  Also, since it was a Gen1 switch that has been discontinued they replaced it with a Gen2 equivalent.Overall I am very pleased with the switches and how they operate day to day.  If the one hadn't died and they could address the resets on the plain switches I'd give them 5 stars all day.  I'm not sure who to blame for the dimming, if it's Leviton or LED bulbs in general so for the moment I won't hold that against them.  Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.###nearly<12:18>|house<38:43>|version<61:68>|control<87:94>|control<87:98>|nearly<99:105>|house<123:128>|start<133:140>|replace<141:150>|year<169:174>|few

      "Dimming buttons adjacent to main switch###dim<0:7>|button<8:15>|main<28:32>|||B079775ZZQ ★★☆☆☆ [2024-08-22] <b>Four problems to discuss</b> I was able to install this without too much trouble, and it fully works.  The dimming capabilities and voice/remote control are pretty cool, but here are 4 problems;#1  - Even when set to \"instant on\", there is a delay.  This make you wonder if you properly hit the switch, and sometimes you hit it again, turning it off before it ever comes on.#2 - The switch is bulky, and it is not easy to cram it into old junction boxes, especially if there is much wiring in there.#3 - The depression switch doesn't move much, so there is no significant blind feedback as to whether you successfully hit the switch.  If you are fumbling in a dark room, or reaching around a corner, the old style up and down switch provides much better tactile feedback.#4 - When hitting the switch, you sometimes hit the dimming buttons instead.  They really should not have designed it so those button are adjacent.  You have to be looking squarely at the switch to accurately hit it.  This may sound like whiny complaint, but most people are accustomed to looking where they are walking and just hitting the switch using their peripheral vision.###problem<8:16>|able<38:42>|install<46:53>|trouble<76:83>|fully<92:97>|dim<110:117>|capability<118:130>|voice<135:140>|remote<141:147>|remote control<141:155>|control<148:155>|pretty<160:166>|cool<167:171>|problem<188:196>|set<213:216>|instant<221:228>|delay<245:250>|wonder<267:273>|properly<281:289>|hit<290:293>|sometimes<310:319>|hit<324:327>|again<331:336>|turn<338:345>|ever<363:367>|bulky<396:401>|easy<417:421>|old<438:441>|junction<442:450>|box<451:456>|junction box<442:456>|especially<458:468>|wiring<486:492>|move<537:541>|significant<563:574>|blind<575:580>|feedback<581:589>|fully<615:620>|successfully<608:620>|hit<621:624>|dark<663:667>|room<668:672>|dark room<663:672>|reach<677:685>|corner<695:701>|old<707:710>|style<711:716>|down<724:728>|provide<736:744>|feedback<765:773>|hit<784:787>|hit<784:791>|sometimes<808:817>|hit<818:821>|dim<826:833>|button<834:840>|button<834:841>|instead<842:849>|design<880:888>|button<901:907>|hit<983:986>|sound<1001:1006>|complaint<1018:1027>|most<1033:1037>|people<1038:1044>|walk<1086:1093>|hit<1103:1106>|hit<1103:1110>"

In my case I had the Dimmable Canless recessed LEDs by Commerical Electric(homedepot brand). These switches only were able to dim my lights to around 70%~, messing around with the dimming configurations did not help. Other smart switches ive tried worked. I currently have Caseta by Lutron, only down side of lutron is the price and that it has no dimmer memory unless you buy their $100 model.- their customer service is terrible do not even bother contacting, you will waste your time.###pro<8:12>|one<17:20>|big<21:24>|con<25:28>|pro<33:37>|hub<43:46>|no hub<40:46>|require<47:55>|board<90:95>|remember<115:123>|last<128:132>|dim<133:136>|set<140:147>|location<199:207>|dim<212:215>|dimmer<212:218>|button<219:226>|accidentally<240:252>|hit<253:256>|turn<277:281>|last<322:326>|plastic<321:328>|con<341:344>|connect<341:350>|amazon alexa<356:368>|alexa<363:368>|away<375:379>|easy<381:385>|con<391:394>|one<403:406>|deal<413:417>|a deal breaker<411:425>|breaker<418:425>|deal breaker<413:425>|dim<460:463>|certain<469:476>|type<477:482>|led<486:490>|case<498:502>|dimmable<513:521>|able<517:521>|recess<530:538>|led<539:543>|brand<577:582>|able<610:614>|dim<618:621>|mess<648:655>|dim<672:675>|dim<672:679>|configuration<680:694>|help<703:707>|smart<715:720>|other smart switch<709:729>|currently<750:759>|caseta<765:771>|lutron<775:781>|side<793:797>|lutron<801:807>|price<815:820>|dim<840:843>|dimmer<840:846>|customer<894:902>|service<903:910>|customer service<894:910>|bother<935:941>|contact<942:952>|waste<963:968>",

So I started searching around for a new smart switch (Dimmer), and ran across the Kasa switches. I went ahead and purchased one to test it out.Installation: 5 stars, super easy and much better in my opinion than the WeMo switches.  Main wires screw onto to the switch plate, and a couple of wires run off to attach with nuts. WeMo had all wires run off to attach with wire nuts which resulted in large amounts of wire and clutter behind the switches making them much harder to work with.Application: 5 stars, switch was immediately recognized and I had no problems with the application. Unlike the WeMo switches where I had several that had significant problems connecting, and they constantly disconnect. The Kasa switch has had a couple of times where the physical switch didn't work for a short period of time, but the app has always worked even when the switch didn't, and then the following day the physical switch would again work. Not sure if that is the result of a bad switch or if something else is going on, but ultimately it is a relatively minor issue as I can always use the application to turn the lights on or off if needed.Wireless: again the setup and connection were easy, and I haven't had any problems with the switch staying connected to my network and always being accessible via the application. I have loads of problems with this on the WeMo switches.Design: The design is much more well thought out from the wiring to even the physical function of the Switch than the WeMo version. WeMo uses a capacitive touch plate that runs the entire length of the switch. This results in the dimmer level constantly being change, turned off, etc... whenever you turn the light switch on or off because almost the entire switch is capacitive touch. Kasa on the other hand has their dimmer buttons at the very top of the switch so they are never in the way but are very easy to access.Quality: Quality seems to be on par with the WeMo, but the design decisions were clearly well thought out. If feels like someone actually tested the Kasa Switch, while it feels like no one actually ever tested the WeMo switch design of they would have easily seen and addressed several of the blatant issues it has.Note: there is one oddity with the Kasa switch, you may consider it a good or bad thing, but when turning the switch on/off there is a slightly delay (maybe 1-2 seconds). It caught me off guard at first and made me think the switch wasn't working properly. I'm still on the fence on whether this is a good thing or not, I think I prefer the instant switching action, but I can see why some people might prefer the delay and once you realize it is there it is honestly not a major issue.The Kasa Dimmer switch isn't perfect, there are a few oddities to it, but it generally functions well, it seems to be far more well thought out than the WeMo switches and is significantly more reliable as a \"Smart\" switch. If you are trying to decide between Kasa and WeMo, don't wait, go with the Kasa switches, they are significantly better in almost every way than my WeMo Switches have been. At some point I will be replacing the rest of my switches with the Kasa Switches and removing WeMo entirely from my house as they just have way too many problems with them.###recently<56:64>|instal<65:74>|wemo<81:85>|test<106:110>|find<125:130>|design<149:155>|design<149:157>|par<171:174>|particularly<171:183>|happy<184:189>|start<206:213>|search<214:223>|new<237:240>|smart<241:246>|dimmer<255:261>|run<268:271>|kasa<283:287>|ahead<305:310>|one<325:328>|test<332:336>|installation<344:356>|5 star<358:365>|super<367:372>|easy<373:377>|opinion<400:407>|wemo<417:421>|main<433:437>|wire<438:442>|wire<438:443>|screw<444:449>|plate<469:474>|couple<482:488>|a couple<480:488>|wire<492:496>|wire<492:497>|run<498:501>|attach<509:515>|nut<521:525>|wemo<527:531>|wire<540:544>|wire<540:545>|run<546:549>|attach<557:563>|wire<569:573>|wire nut<569:578>|nut<574:578>|result<585:591>|result<585:593>|large<597:602>|amount<603:610>|wire<614:618>|hard<668:674>|application<688:699>|5 star<701:708>|immediately<721:732>|recognize<733:743>|no problem<754:765>|problem<757:765>|application<775:786>|wemo<799:803>|ever<826:830>|significant<842:853>|problem<854:862>|connect<863:873>|constantly<884:894>|disconnect<895:905>|kasa<911:915>|couple<933:939>|a couple<931:939>|couple of time<933:948>|physical<959:967>|physical switch<959:974>|short<993:998>|period<999:1005>|short period<993:1005>|period of time<999:1013>|always<1031:1037>|follow<1087:1096>|day<1097:1100>|physical<1105:1113>|physical switch<1105:1120>|again<1127:1132>|result<1163:1169>|ultimately<1224:1234>|relatively<1243:1253>|minor<1254:1259>|issue<1260:1265>|always<1275:1281>|application<1290:1301>|turn<1305:1309>|wireless<1341:1349>|again<1351:1356>|setup<1361:1366>|connection<1371:1381>|easy<1387:1391>|problem<1415:1423>|any problem<1411:1423>|stay<1440:1447>|connect<1448:1457>|network<1464:1471>|always<1476:1482>|access<1489:1495>|application<1508:1519>|load<1528:1533>|problem<1537:1545>|wemo<1563:1567>|design<1577:1583>|design<1589:1595>|wiring<1635:1641>|physical<1654:1662>|function<1663:1671>|wemo<1695:1699>|version<1700:1707>|wemo<1709:1713>|touch<1732:1737>|plate<1738:1743>|run<1749:1752>|run<1749:1753>|entire<1758:1764>|length<1765:1771>|result<1792:1798>|result<1792:1799>|dimmer<1807:1813>|level<1814:1819>|constantly<1820:1830>|change<1837:1843>|turn<1845:1849>|turn<1845:1851>|ever<1868:1872>|never<1867:1872>|turn<1877:1881>|almost<1917:1923>|entire<1928:1934>|touch<1956:1961>|kasa<1963:1967>|hand<1981:1985>|dimmer<1996:2002>|button<2003:2010>|top<2023:2026>|never<2053:2058>|ever<2054:2058>|easy<2083:2087>|access<2091:2097>|par<2130:2133>|wemo<2143:2147>|design<2157:2163>|decision<2164:2173>|clearly<2179:2186>|feel<2208:2213>|one<2223:2226>|actually<2227:2235>|test<2236:2240>|test<2236:2242>|kasa<2247:2251>|feel<2269:2274>|one<2283:2286>|actually<2287:2295>|ever<2296:2300>|test<2301:2305>|test<2301:2307>|wemo<2312:2316>|design<2324:2330>|easily<2350:2356>|address<2366:2375>|ever<2377:2381>|issue<2399:2404>|issue<2399:2405>|note<2413:2417>|one<2428:2431>|kasa<2448:2452>|consider<2469:2477>|turn<2511:2515>|turn<2511:2518>|slightly<2548:2556>|delay<2557:2562>|2 second<2572:2581>|second<2574:2581>|first<2610:2615>|properly<2660:2668>|still<2674:2679>|prefer<2743:2749>|instant<2754:2761>|action<2772:2778>|some people<2798:2809>|people<2803:2809>|prefer<2816:2822>|delay<2827:2832>|realize<2846:2853>|one<2873:2876>|honestly<2872:2880>|major<2887:2892>|issue<2893:2898>|kasa<2903:2907>|dimmer<2908:2914>|generally<2976:2985>|function<2986:2994>|function<2986:2995>|far<3017:3020>|wemo<3052:3056>|significant<3073:3084>|significantly<3073:3086>|reliable<3092:3100>|smart<3107:3112>|decide<3143:3149>|kasa<3158:3162>|wemo<3167:3171>|wait<3179:3183>|kasa<3197:3201>|significant<3221:3232>|significantly<3221:3234>|almost<3245:3251>|ever<3252:3256>|wemo<3270:3274>|switches<3275:3283>|point<3303:3308>|replace<3319:3328>|the rest<3329:3337>|rest<3333:3337>|kasa<3362:3366>|switches<3367:3375>|remove<3380:3388>|wemo<3389:3393>|entire<3394:3400>|entirely<3394:3402>|house<3411:3416>|any problem<3444:3456>|problem<3448:3456>",
      "Brightness control panel above the switch###brightness<0:10>|control<11:18>|panel<19:24>|||B079775ZZQ ★★★★☆ [2019-06-20] <b>Great Dimmer Switch</b> I have an overhead dining room light that had been driving me nuts for years. It has always been too bright and harsh, and we only had the standard light switch. I had been thinking about putting a dimmer switch on for years, but never got around to it until now.I chose the TP-Link version because I already have several Kasa Smart Plugs in my household, along with an Amazon Echo that I use to control them. I figured it would be easier to have fewer smart home ecosystems to have to deal with.The installation was easy, but you have to be comfortable with basic wiring and dealing with electricity. You also need to be sure that you have a neutral wire available -- mine was tucked back behind the other wires. Additionally, you should have a voltage sensor handy, as you will need to use it to determine which wire has the electricity running through it when the switch is off. You can purchase a cheap one, but this is a requirement. Once you have done that, you just boot up the Kasa app, and it runs you through everything. Total installation time was about 20 minutes or so.Once you have the switch installed, the app runs you through the set up, and my light was working in no time. It was very easy, and I had no issues.The switch itself looks decent -- when it is off, a white circle of light appears on the switch, which makes it easy to find in the dark, but might be annoying if you are installing this in your bedroom. There is also a brightness control panel above the switch.The only thing to be aware of with this switch is that if you are using LED lights, you want to make sure you have dimmable LEDs. Also, you should try to get some that don't buzz. I was using cheap store brand LEDs that were supposedly dimmable, but they would buzz like crazy at lower light levels and even flicker. I went out and bought some better ones, and it mostly solved the problem. There is no longer any flickering, but just a slight buzz at lower levels that I can definitely deal with.The integration with Alexa is fabulous, as you can turn the light on and off and choose a dimming value with your voice. The app also works well, but I generally use Alexa.Overall, I highly recommend this switch to anyone looking to upgrade their switches and add to their smart home ecosystem. Just be prepared to do some VERY basic wiring.###dimmer<9:15>|overhead<37:45>|dining<46:52>|room<53:57>|dining room<46:57>|dining room light<46:63>|drive<78:85>|nut<89:93>|year<98:103>|always<112:118>|bright<128:134>|standard<166:174>|standard light switch<166:187>|put<215:222>|dimmer<225:231>|year<246:251>|never<257:262>|now<286:289>|choose<292:297>|tp<302:304>|tp link<302:309>|link<305:309>|the tp link<298:309>|version<310:317>|already<328:335>|kasa<349:353>|smart<354:359>|kasa smart<349:359>|plugs<360:365>|household<372:381>|echo<404:408>|control<423:430>|figure<439:446>|easy<459:465>|smart<480:485>|home<486:490>|smart home<480:490>|ecosystem<491:500>|home ecosystem<486:500>|smart home ecosystem<480:500>|ecosystem<491:501>|smart home ecosystem<480:501>|home ecosystem<486:501>|deal<513:517>|installation<527:539>|easy<544:548>|comfortable<569:580>|basic<586:591>|wiring<592:598>|deal<603:607>|deal<603:610>|electricity<616:627>|neutral<670:677>|a neutral wire<668:682>|neutral wire<670:682>|wire<678:682>|available<683:692>|back<712:716>|wire<734:738>|wire<734:739>|additionally<741:753>|voltage<773:780>|sensor<781:787>|handy<788:793>|determine<825:834>|wire<841:845>|electricity<854:865>|run<866:873>|cheap<928:933>|one<934:937>|requirement<953:964>|one<981:984>|kasa<1012:1016>|the kasa app<1008:1020>|kasa app<1012:1020>|run<1029:1033>|total<1058:1063>|installation<1064:1076>|20 minute<1092:1102>|minute<1095:1102>|instal<1134:1143>|run<1153:1157>|set<1174:1177>|easy<1231:1235>|no issue<1247:1256>|issue<1250:1256>|decent<1281:1287>|white<1309:1314>|white circle<1309:1321>|circle<1315:1321>|appear<1331:1338>|easy<1369:1373>|find<1377:1381>|dark<1389:1393>|annoying<1408:1416>|instal<1428:1438>|room<1455:1459>|bedroom<1452:1459>|bright<1477:1483>|brightness<1477:1487>|control<1488:1495>|panel<1496:1501>|aware<1540:1545>|led<1591:1594>|led light<1591:1601>|dimmable<1634:1642>|led<1643:1646>|dimmable led<1634:1647>|led<1643:1647>|buzz<1693:1697>|cheap<1711:1716>|store<1717:1722>|brand<1723:1728>|led<1729:1732>|led<1729:1733>|dimmable<1755:1763>|buzz<1780:1784>|crazy<1790:1795>|low<1799:1804>|level<1811:1817>|flick<1827:1834>|one<1870:1873>|one<1870:1874>|mostly<1883:1889>|solve<1890:1896>|problem<1901:1908>|long<1922:1928>|flick<1933:1940>|flickering<1933:1943>|slight<1956:1962>|buzz<1963:1967>|low<1971:1976>|low level<1971:1983>|level<1977:1983>|definitely<1995:2005>|deal<2006:2010>|integration<2020:2031>|integration with alexa<2020:2042>|alexa<2037:2042>|turn<2067:2071>|choose<2097:2103>|dim<2106:2113>|value<2114:2119>|voice<2130:2135>|generally<2168:2177>|alexa<2182:2187>|overall<2188:2195>|highly<2199:2205>|recommend<2206:2215>|one<2234:2237>|upgrade<2249:2256>|add<2276:2279>|smart<2289:2294>|smart home<2289:2299>|home<2295:2299>|home ecosystem<2295:2309>|ecosystem<2300:2309>|smart home ecosystem<2289:2309>|basic<2344:2349>|wiring<2350:2356>",

      "OK but not amazing quality|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★☆☆ [2020-11-01] <b>Needs Some Work, Interferes w/Other Alexa Devices</b> My entire house is a smart home - all the lights are on Alexa, the garage doors are on Alexa, etc. Wanting to put voice control everywhere, I bought a Leviton Voice Dimmer to try it out, hoping to buy more of them if I liked it. Do I like it? Well, \"it's complicated\".Right off the bat, the install was fairly difficult. The voice dimmer is deeper than many wifi light switches, so gang box space becomes an issue. Along with this, the wires on the Leviton are stranded copper but with no pre-soldering that many wifi switches have, so wire nuts don't want to grip the wire. After fiddling with them for quite a while with no success, I grabbed my soldering iron and threw some solder on the wire tips - THIS MAKES AN IMMENSE DIFFERENCE IN THE INSTALL IF YOU ARE USING WIRE NUTS!Once installed, the issues began. The Leviton didn't want to stay connected to my wifi, half the time responding to my Alexa commands with \"I'm having trouble connecting to the internet\". A firmware update from my phone (which took several tries) did seem to fix this for the most part, but it does still do this every now and then.Another major issue: This interferes with other Alexa voice devices. My Echos are beyond earshot of the Leviton, but my ecobee5 thermostat (that has Alexa voice control built in) is within range, and this is a nightmare. They won't coordinate with each other, so if I say an Alexa command, they both try listen and respond. So far, no amount of fiddling with the Alexa app, Leviton app, or Ecobee app can get these to not interfere with each other - they both hear the command and try to respond. I resorted to muting the mic on my thermostat so that only the Leviton listened, but this is a shame as the thermostat is a better device with a better speaker.A few more minor annoyances: The speaker in the Leviton is OK but not amazing. Playing music through it sounds lackluster, but I won't ding the voice dimmer too much for this as playing music on the dimmer isn't its primary purpose. Another annoyance is that the Leviton will occasionally respond to itself - if the response it's giving has the word \"Alexa\" in it, it'll sometimes trigger itself and interrupt its own response, thinking someone has said the word \"Alexa\".If Leviton keeps working on this and works out the bugs by issuing new firmware, I can imagine this becoming a great device. But for now, the Leviton Voice Dimmer just seems like a work in progress. It's not quite there yet, and this makes for a frustrating experience. I do hope it gets better, though, as I'd love to have something like this all throughout my house, but it's just not there yet.###alexa<39:44>|entire<60:66>|entire house<60:72>|house<67:72>|smart<78:83>|smart home<78:88>|home<84:88>|a smart home<76:88>|alexa<113:118>|garage<124:130>|door<131:136>|alexa<144:149>|put<167:170>|voice<171:176>|voice control<171:184>|control<177:184>|everywhere<185:195>|leviton<208:215>|voice<216:221>|dimmer<222:228>|hope<244:250>|install<348:355>|fairly<360:366>|difficult<367:376>|voice<382:387>|dimmer<388:394>|deep<398:404>|wifi<415:419>|gang<439:443>|box<444:447>|gang box<439:447>|space<448:453>|become<454:461>|an issue<462:470>|issue<465:470>|wire<493:497>|wire<493:498>|leviton<506:513>|strand<518:526>|copper<527:533>|pre<546:549>|wifi<570:574>|wire<593:597>|wire nut<593:602>|nut<598:602>|wire<626:630>|while<669:674>|success<683:690>|grab<694:701>|throw<724:729>|wire<749:753>|tip<754:758>|difference<783:793>|install<801:808>|wire<826:830>|install<841:848>|instal<841:850>|issue<856:861>|issue<856:862>|begin<863:868>|leviton<874:881>|stay<897:901>|connected<902:911>|wifi<918:922>|respond<938:945>|de<944:948>|respond<938:948>|alexa<955:960>|command<961:968>|alexa command<955:968>|alexa command<955:969>|command<961:969>|trouble<987:994>|connect<995:1005>|internet<1013:1021>|firmware<1026:1034>|firmware update<1026:1041>|update<1035:1041>|a firmware update<1024:1041>|phone<1050:1055>|fix<1095:1098>|most<1112:1116>|part<1117:1121>|still<1135:1140>|now<1155:1158>|major<1176:1181>|issue<1182:1187>|interfere<1194:1203>|interfere<1194:1204>|alexa<1216:1221>|voice<1222:1227>|device<1228:1234>|device<1228:1235>|leviton<1272:1279>|most<1300:1304>|alexa<1317:1322>|voice<1323:1328>|control<1329:1336>|voice control<1323:1336>|build<1337:1342>|range<1357:1362>|nightmare<1378:1387>|alexa<1443:1448>|alexa command<1443:1456>|command<1449:1456>|listen<1472:1478>|respond<1483:1490>|far<1495:1498>|amount<1503:1509>|alexa<1531:1536>|leviton<1542:1549>|leviton app<1542:1553>|interfere<1590:1599>|hear<1628:1632>|command<1637:1644>|respond<1656:1663>|most<1704:1708>|leviton<1728:1735>|listen<1736:1742>|listen<1736:1744>|shame<1760:1765>|a shame<1758:1765>|most<1777:1781>|device<1796:1802>|speaker<1817:1824>|minor<1836:1841>|annoyance<1842:1851>|annoyance<1842:1852>|speaker<1858:1865>|leviton<1873:1880>|play<1904:1911>|music<1912:1917>|sound<1929:1935>|de<1960:1964>|voice<1969:1974>|dimmer<1975:1981>|play<2003:2010>|music<2011:2016>|dimmer<2024:2030>|primary<2041:2048>|purpose<2049:2056>|annoyance<2066:2075>|leviton<2088:2095>|occasionally<2101:2113>|respond<2114:2121>|response<2141:2149>|word<2170:2174>|alexa<2176:2181>|sometimes<2196:2205>|trigger<2206:2213>|own<2239:2242>|response<2243:2251>|word<2283:2287>|alexa<2289:2294>|leviton<2299:2306>|keep<2307:2312>|bug<2347:2351>|issue<2355:2362>|new<2363:2366>|firmware<2367:2375>|imagine<2383:2390>|become<2396:2404>|device<2413:2419>|now<2429:2432>|leviton<2438:2445>|voice<2446:2451>|dimmer<2452:2458>|yet<2516:2519>|frustrating<2542:2553>|experience<2554:2564>|hope<2571:2575>|though<2592:2598>|love<2607:2611>|house<2658:2663>|yet<2689:2692>",
      "Built-in speaker###build<0:5>|speaker<9:16>|||B08RSM1KYN ★☆☆☆☆ [2023-11-21] <b>Terrible sound lacks popular app support.</b> Review of Leviton Decora Smart Voice Dimmer.After my Ecobee Switch+ died after many years of use I thought I would try this as a replacement. I liked the idea of the dimming. There isn’t really much out there on this subset of smart switches so I’m reviewing this to help get awareness out there.Pros: Easy to install, good documentation. Low Profile. The app seems to do a good job allowing for dimming control and some neat options.Cons: Horrific audio quality. It’s actually scratchy and horribly tinny. You would not want to listen to music given how scratchy and weak the audio is.  This ‘Alexa’ does not support SiriusXM or Apple Music playback (the EcobeeSwitch+ does). I’m sure there are more support limitations, I just haven’t found them yet.  When the music is playing Alexa won’t respond to you to shut it off. The built in speaker does not appear to have volume controls that you can adjust.I am returning this to buy a simple dimmer and a nice Alexa Echo. Stay away or at least know what you’re getting into.###sound<12:17>|lack<18:23>|popular<24:31>|support<36:43>|leviton<59:66>|decora<67:73>|leviton decora<59:73>|smart<74:79>|decora smart<67:79>|leviton decora smart<59:79>|voice<80:85>|dimmer<86:92>|die<117:121>|year<133:138>|many year<128:138>|year of use<133:145>|replacement<178:189>|idea<203:207>|dimming<215:222>|dim<215:222>|smart<276:281>|help<316:320>|pro<345:349>|easy<351:355>|install<359:366>|documentation<373:386>|low<388:391>|profile<392:399>|job<428:431>|allow<432:440>|dimming<445:452>|dim<445:452>|control<453:460>|neat<470:474>|option<475:482>|con<483:487>|actually<518:526>|listen<578:584>|music<588:593>|give<594:599>|weak<617:621>|alexa<643:648>|support<659:666>|apple<679:684>|music<685:690>|support<750:757>|limitation<758:769>|find<786:791>|yet<797:800>|music<812:817>|play<821:828>|alexa<829:834>|respond<841:848>|shut<859:863>|build<876:881>|speaker<885:892>|appear<902:908>|volume<917:923>|control<924:931>|control<924:932>|adjust<946:952>|return<958:967>|simple<982:988>|dimmer<989:995>|alexa<1007:1012>|alexa echo<1007:1017>|echo<1013:1017>|stay<1019:1023>|away<1024:1028>|least<1035:1040>",

I do not understand why a speaker would be on an item without the ability to change the volume.###volume<19:25>|control<26:33>|dimmer<54:60>|alexa<73:78>|build<79:84>|description<100:111>|play<127:131>|music<132:137>|listen<147:153>|news<157:161>|volume<209:215>|control<216:223>|sit<241:248>|close<254:259>|next<291:295>|hear<328:332>|run<372:379>|play<383:387>|play<383:390>|noise<401:406>|hear<439:443>|understand<457:467>|speaker<474:481>|ability<514:521>|change<525:531>|volume<536:542>",
      "Has a small speaker###small<6:11>|small speaker<6:19>|speaker<12:19>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★★★ [2020-02-15] <b>Awesome Alexa add on - Beginners, not for the faint of heart</b> Straight to the point.....Here are a few things to consider when purchasing this device:1.  Make sure your light switch you are trying to replace has a NEUTRAL wire, without this Alexa will NOT WORK.2.  Wiring this smart switch was easy considering I am not an electrician.  My advice:  a.  Watch youtube videos to get familiar with wiring and the significance of what a ground, LIVE, LOAD, Transfer and a Neutral wire is and its significance.  b.  check the light switch and make sure all required wires are in place, otherwise, it will be a long night  c.  Test the wifi, by downloading a SPEEDTEST App on your mobile device in the area you wish to install the smart switch.  By doing this will give you a good idea of how much internet bandwidth you are getting in that area to ensure it works properly.3.  Make sure your internet bandwidth is at least 50+mbps to ensure that you will always have a solid connection to the internet and Alexa will be happy.  (if you have DSL, change it to cable or fiber optic)4.  Be sure to have someone who is familar /computer savvy with downloading the Leviton App and syncing it to work with the Alexa App as well.5.  Once everything is synced up and all the above is complete you will not have any issues going forward.Since my install of this smart light switch I have been very happy and yet to have encountered any problems.  The only negative I have on the unit is that there is no way to pair it up to a Bluetooth device to help compensate with the small speaker that it comes in.  The sound is great but could use a little bit more punch.  I will definitely buy a few more.###alexa<11:16>|add<17:20>|faint<49:54>|straight<68:76>|point<84:89>|consider<119:127>|device<149:155>|place<208:213>|replace<206:213>|neutral<220:227>|neutral wire<220:232>|a neutral wire<218:232>|wire<228:232>|alexa<247:252>|wire<271:277>|smart<283:288>|easy<300:304>|consider<305:313>|consider<305:316>|an electrician<326:340>|electrician<329:340>|advice<346:352>|watch<359:364>|youtube<365:372>|youtube video<365:379>|video<373:379>|familiar<387:395>|wiring<401:407>|ground<439:445>|live<447:451>|load<453:457>|neutral<474:481>|a neutral wire<472:486>|wire<482:486>|neutral wire<474:486>|check<517:522>|require<558:566>|wire<567:571>|wire<567:572>|place<580:585>|otherwise<587:596>|long<611:615>|night<616:621>|test<627:631>|wifi<636:640>|download<645:656>|mobile<681:687>|device<688:694>|area<702:706>|wish<711:715>|install<719:726>|smart<731:736>|give<765:769>|idea<781:785>|internet<798:806>|bandwidth<807:816>|area<841:845>|ensure<849:855>|internet<893:901>|bandwidth<902:911>|least<918:923>|ensure<935:941>|always<956:962>|solid<970:975>|connection<976:986>|internet<994:1002>|alexa<1007:1012>|happy<1021:1026>|change<1047:1053>|cable<1060:1065>|fiber<1069:1074>|savvy<1134:1139>|download<1145:1156>|leviton<1161:1168>|leviton app<1161:1172>|the leviton app<1157:1172>|sync<1177:1184>|alexa<1205:1210>|sync<1246:1252>|complete<1277:1285>|issue<1308:1314>|any issue<1304:1314>|forward<1321:1328>|install<1338:1345>|smart<1354:1359>|happy<1390:1395>|yet<1400:1403>|encounter<1412:1423>|any problem<1424:1436>|problem<1428:1436>|negative<1448:1456>|unit<1471:1475>|pair<1503:1507>|bluetooth<1519:1528>|device<1529:1535>|help<1539:1543>|small<1564:1569>|small speaker<1564:1577>|speaker<1570:1577>|sound<1601:1606>|definitely<1663:1673>",

If you search these review for “stuck” there seems to be several others that have had this issue where the lights become stuck in the on or off position.  The factory reset, or reset at the circuit breaker doesn’t help.  Customer service tried to wear me down with multiple calls and fruitless attempts to reset the switch and eventually they sent a replacement switch.  The replacement switch only took 2 weeks to also become stuck on the on position so it’s fried also.  The product has a 5 year warranty so I plan to wear down customer service and have them send another replacement and I’ll keep doing so as long as needed.  I strongly caution anyone considering this switch to read the negative feedback.The voice and Alexa integration is the only part that works well.  The speaker is really too small and sounds like a tin can.  The microphone is too sensitive so it picks up and the weak speaker responds instead of better sounding Alexa devices nearby.I initially had an electrician (try to) instal it but they didn’t read the directions carefully enough so his boss had to come out and install it correctly so I wouldn’t say it’s easy for most people to install.  The electricians installed two Leviton remote switches and those worked ok for a few weeks but started having issues with consistently responding.  Given all the issues and other reviews, the Voice dimmer likely has a hardware defect and Leviton likely knows it.  Safe your money and get a different smart switch.###sound<3:9>|suddenly<47:55>|stick<60:65>|stuck<60:65>|position<78:86>|likely<105:111>|defect<132:138>|issue<139:144>|search<154:160>|stuck<179:184>|stick<179:184>|issue<238:243>|become<261:267>|stick<268:273>|stuck<268:273>|position<291:299>|off position<287:299>|factory<306:313>|reset<314:319>|factory reset<306:319>|reset<324:329>|circuit<337:344>|breaker<345:352>|circuit breaker<337:352>|the circuit breaker<333:352>|help<361:365>|customer<368:376>|customer service<368:384>|service<377:384>|multiple<412:420>|call<421:426>|attempt<441:449>|reset<453:458>|eventually<474:484>|send<490:494>|replacement<497:508>|replacement<522:533>|week<553:558>|2 week<551:558>|become<567:573>|stuck<574:579>|stick<574:579>|position<590:598>|5 year<638:644>|year<640:644>|year warranty<640:653>|warranty<645:653>|plan<659:663>|customer<677:685>|service<686:693>|customer service<677:693>|send<708:712>|replacement<721:732>|keep<742:746>|long<759:763>|consider<802:813>|read<829:833>|negative<838:846>|feedback<847:855>|voice<860:865>|alexa<870:875>|alexa integration<870:887>|integration<876:887>|part<900:904>|speaker<927:934>|small<949:954>|sound<959:965>|sensitive<1005:1014>|pick<1021:1026>|weak<1038:1042>|speaker<1043:1050>|respond<1051:1059>|instead<1060:1067>|sound<1078:1086>|alexa<1087:1092>|device<1093:1100>|initially<1110:1119>|an electrician<1124:1138>|electrician<1127:1138>|instal<1148:1154>|read<1174:1178>|direction<1183:1193>|carefully<1194:1203>|instal<1243:1249>|install<1243:1250>|correctly<1254:1263>|easy<1287:1291>|most<1296:1300>|people<1301:1307>|instal<1311:1317>|install<1311:1318>|electrician<1325:1336>|electrician<1325:1337>|instal<1338:1344>|install<1338:1345>|instal<1338:1347>|leviton<1352:1359>|remote<1360:1366>|a few week<1400:1411>|week<1406:1411>|few week<1402:1411>|start<1416:1423>|issue<1431:1436>|issue<1431:1437>|consistently<1443:1455>|respond<1456:1466>|give<1469:1474>|issue<1483:1488>|issue<1483:1489>|voice<1513:1518>|dimmer<1519:1525>|likely<1526:1532>|hardware<1539:1547>|defect<1548:1554>|leviton<1559:1566>|likely<1567:1573>|safe<1585:1589>|money<1595:1600>|different<1611:1620>|smart<1621:1626>",

Only thing to be aware of the speaker makes a buzzing sound due to line interference which gets louder when dimming the light.  Can be heard when standing about 2-3 feet from light.  Leviton is aware of this and states there is nothing to worry about and does not have a fix for this.  I have a different brand switch with Alexa built in that does not dim and this brand has no noise in the speaker.

The wifi connection is fine, the whole network has internet and runs very quickly (have 2.5gb internet) and there are no problems anywhere else. It just just the voice dimmers, they all lose connection quite a lot. So throughout the house you hear these little beeps randomly to signal connection lost or restored. Pretty annoying when this is the only device having an issue. It isn't even the dimmer itself, as I can still control that with very good response time from the My Leviton app or from Google Home. ONLY the Alexa connection gets lost constantly.The other big gripe is you cannot change the wake word from Alexa. You'd think after a couple years of firmware updates now that they would make the other options that Echo devices have available.Save your money and don't get these voice dimmers. The loss of Alexa throughout the day and the annoying beeps around the house makes these not worth it. The other switch and dimmer products (2nd gen) seem to work great 99% of the time though.###change<10:16>|wake<17:21>|word<22:26>|wake word<17:26>|alexa<28:33>|lose<34:38>|lose<34:39>|connection<40:50>|instal<76:85>|week<94:98>|now<99:102>|alexa<125:130>|connection<138:148>|lose<154:158>|day<171:174>|day<181:184>|wifi<190:194>|wifi connection<190:205>|connection<195:205>|whole<219:224>|network<225:232>|internet<237:245>|run<250:254>|quickly<260:267>|internet<280:288>|problem<307:315>|no problem<304:315>|anywhere<316:324>|voice<348:353>|dimmer<354:360>|dimmer<354:361>|lose<372:376>|connection<377:387>|house<419:424>|hear<429:433>|randomly<453:461>|signal<465:471>|connection<472:482>|lose<483:487>|restore<491:499>|pretty<501:507>|annoying<508:516>|device<539:545>|issue<556:561>|an issue<553:561>|dimmer<581:587>|still<605:610>|control<611:618>|response<639:647>|response time<639:652>|leviton<665:672>|leviton app<665:676>|google<685:691>|google home<685:696>|home<692:696>|alexa<707:712>|connection<713:723>|lose<729:733>|constantly<734:744>|big<755:758>|gripe<759:764>|change<779:785>|wake<790:794>|word<795:799>|wake word<790:799>|alexa<805:810>|a couple<830:838>|couple<832:838>|year<839:844>|firmware<848:856>|update<857:864>|firmware update<848:864>|now<865:868>|option<900:907>|echo<913:917>|device<918:924>|echo device<913:925>|device<918:925>|available<931:940>|save<941:945>|money<951:956>|voice<977:982>|dimmer<983:989>|dimmer<983:990>|loss<996:1000>|alexa<1004:1009>|day<1025:1028>|annoying<1037:1045>|house<1063:1068>|worth<1085:1090>|dimmer<1116:1122>|2nd<1133:1136>|2nd gen<1133:1140>|gen<1137:1140>|though<1177:1183>",

Safe your money and get a different smart switch.###sound<3:9>|suddenly<47:55>|stick<60:65>|stuck<60:65>|position<78:86>|likely<105:111>|defect<132:138>|issue<139:144>|search<154:160>|stuck<179:184>|stick<179:184>|issue<238:243>|become<261:267>|stick<268:273>|stuck<268:273>|position<291:299>|off position<287:299>|factory<306:313>|reset<314:319>|factory reset<306:319>|reset<324:329>|circuit<337:344>|breaker<345:352>|circuit breaker<337:352>|the circuit breaker<333:352>|help<361:365>|customer<368:376>|customer service<368:384>|service<377:384>|multiple<412:420>|call<421:426>|attempt<441:449>|reset<453:458>|eventually<474:484>|send<490:494>|replacement<497:508>|replacement<522:533>|week<553:558>|2 week<551:558>|become<567:573>|stuck<574:579>|stick<574:579>|position<590:598>|5 year<638:644>|year<640:644>|year warranty<640:653>|warranty<645:653>|plan<659:663>|customer<677:685>|service<686:693>|customer service<677:693>|send<708:712>|replacement<721:732>|keep<742:746>|long<759:763>|consider<802:813>|read<829:833>|negative<838:846>|feedback<847:855>|voice<860:865>|alexa<870:875>|alexa integration<870:887>|integration<876:887>|part<900:904>|speaker<927:934>|small<949:954>|sound<959:965>|sensitive<1005:1014>|pick<1021:1026>|weak<1038:1042>|speaker<1043:1050>|respond<1051:1059>|instead<1060:1067>|sound<1078:1086>|alexa<1087:1092>|device<1093:1100>|initially<1110:1119>|an electrician<1124:1138>|electrician<1127:1138>|instal<1148:1154>|read<1174:1178>|direction<1183:1193>|carefully<1194:1203>|instal<1243:1249>|install<1243:1250>|correctly<1254:1263>|easy<1287:1291>|most<1296:1300>|people<1301:1307>|instal<1311:1317>|install<1311:1318>|electrician<1325:1336>|electrician<1325:1337>|instal<1338:1344>|install<1338:1345>|instal<1338:1347>|leviton<1352:1359>|remote<1360:1366>|a few week<1400:1411>|week<1406:1411>|few week<1402:1411>|start<1416:1423>|issue<1431:1436>|issue<1431:1437>|consistently<1443:1455>|respond<1456:1466>|give<1469:1474>|issue<1483:1488>|issue<1483:1489>|voice<1513:1518>|dimmer<1519:1525>|likely<1526:1532>|hardware<1539:1547>|defect<1548:1554>|leviton<1559:1566>|likely<1567:1573>|safe<1585:1589>|money<1595:1600>|different<1611:1620>|smart<1621:1626>",
      "Internal speaker###internal<0:8>|speaker<9:16>|||B08RSM1KYN ★☆☆☆☆ [2021-06-01] <b>Leviton needs to go back to the drawing board (review written by a technician)</b> A review is sometimes only as good as the experience of the person who is leaving it.  For this reason, I often ignore some reviews and give much more weight to others.  I will begin by saying that I have over 20 years experience as a computer technician and have a family full of people who work in trades (plumbing, heating, air conditioning, and electric) so my home network and my electrical system are in solid working order.  I have a wireless mesh network blanketing my property and there are no dead spots anywhere in my house.  Here is my review of this item:(1) Ergonomics.  Unlike other switches, this Leviton switch is a completely smooth, flat, featureless plastic surface.  It is impossible to reliably locate the on button in complete darkness - it is exactly the same as the off button.  While you can talk to it (and that has its own issues), the buttons should be easy to locate with your eyes closed and should be slightly illuminated so that you can see it but not be annoyed by it.(2) Connectivity.  As you will see in other reviews dating back to 2017, the devices bings and bongs, bleeps and beeps, randomly and annoyingly throughout the day and night.  It disconnects from the internet whenever it feels like it.  My wireless access points are not more than 20 feet away and not one of my 4 Leviton switches can maintain a solid connection.  The Tp-Link Kasa switch that is directly next to it has zero connectivity issues, and all my mobile devices have no issues with the home wifi.  Leviton's response to my email is that the wifi is getting affected by the fact that it is installed in a metal box with a metal cover.  \"Unfortunately, for wireless in-wall devices, metal wall boxes or metal wall plates typically attenuate the signal, so even if connected, it could be intermittent. While we recognize that it is difficult to change a metal wall box, if you can, we recommend using Leviton Decora wall plates.\"  If this is true, then why aren't the competitors' smart switches affected by the metal?  As you can see in my photo, the Tp-Link Kasa switch is right next to the Leviton switch and has never had any connectivity issues.(3) Lighting Performance.  To dim or brighten the lights, you must hold down the power on or off buttons.  It makes the job very imprecise.  In addition, every Leviton switch produces an audible hum over the internal speaker whenever the dimmer is used (I have halogen as well as LED bulb fixtures and it happens on all of them).  Maybe because it is so compact, Leviton needs to shield the internal speaker from the feedback of the dimmer.  I do not know why it happens but it happens on all four of mine.(4) Smart Home Performance.  Occasionally, I will tell Alexa to turn on the lights, she will say \"OK\", and nothing will happen.  I tell her to turn them off, she says \"OK\", and nothing happens.  I then have to completely reset the switch and join it to my Alexa network.  I have never had to do this with my Alexa Echo or my cheaper switches from Leviton's competitors.  Other times, I will send it a voice command and it will stutter and lock up.  When I try to use the switch to \"drop in\" on another Alexa device, it completely locks up the device and says \"Calling with Alexa is not supp...Calling with Alexa is not supp...Calling with Alexa is not supp...\" in a loop.  Leviton says it is a known bug.  Leviton has now informed me that using the switch to make a call is not supported, even though it has both a mic and a speaker and is connected to Alexa.  Um... why not?Bottom LineIf you expect this to be an Alexa Echo inside your wall, it is not and it probably never will be.  If you expect it to do its job as a dimmable light switch, it will do a poor job of it when compared to switches that are a quarter of the price.  If Amazon is your smart home platform of choice, buy an Alexa Echo for half the price of this switch and you will get all the features along with some decent quality speakers.  Then, buy your remaining switches from Tp-Link Kasa (pictured in the photo) or another capable manufacturer to round out your smart home purchase.  I had high hopes for these switches but they are all being returned after 2 months of struggling to make them work.###leviton<3:10>|back<23:27>|board<43:48>|write<57:64>|sometimes<98:107>|experience<128:138>|person<146:152>|leave<160:167>|reason<182:188>|often<192:197>|ignore<198:204>|give<222:226>|begin<263:268>|year<299:304>|experience<305:315>|computer<321:329>|family<352:358>|full<359:363>|people<367:373>|electric<435:443>|home<451:455>|network<456:463>|electric<471:479>|electrical<471:481>|system<482:488>|solid<496:501>|working<502:509>|wireless<527:535>|mesh<536:540>|network<541:548>|mesh

It does not correctly show when light is on or off and does not work 90% of the time.Go with Lutron and don’t waste your money.The only good thing about this is that it has alexa built in with a speaker, but it does not have full alexa-device features.

      "Speaker###speaker<0:7>|||B08RSM1KYN ★★★☆☆ [2020-12-05] <b>Not quite ready for prime time</b> Hopefully software updates will make this more stable.  Sometimes it won’t even control the load (crashes I assume).  You have to remove power or pull the power disconnect on it to reboot it again to control the load.  Also, this does not appear as full Alexa device on Amazon side, you cannot associate it to a group like an echo dot or Alexa built into other devices like Sonos to group into a room with other devices.  Leviton implemented the lowest/basic Alexa certification.  For simple things like checking weather or something its OK, speaker is decent.  But I would not buy anymore of these.  If the software improves I’ll keep it otherwise I will replace this with something that at least controls the load 100% of the time.###ready<13:18>|full<42:46>|hopefully<38:47>|software<48:56>|software update<48:64>|update<57:64>|stable<85:91>|sometimes<94:103>|control<118:125>|load<130:134>|assume<146:152>|remove<168:174>|power<175:180>|pull<184:188>|power<193:198>|disconnect<199:209>|reboot<219:225>|again<229:234>|control<238:245>|load<250:254>|appear<277:283>|full<287:291>|alexa<292:297>|device<298:304>|side<315:319>|group<350:355>|echo<364:368>|dot<369:372>|echo dot<364:372>|alexa<376:381>|build<382:387>|device<399:405>|device<399:406>|group<421:426>|room<434:438>|device<450:456>|device<450:457>|leviton<460:467>|low<484:490>|basic<491:496>|alexa<497:502>|simple<523:529>|check<542:550>|weather<551:558>|speaker<580:587>|decent<591:597>|anymore<620:627>|software<646:654>|improve<655:663>|keep<669:673>|otherwise<677:686>|replace<694:701>|least<730:735>|control<736:743>|control<736:744>|load<749:753>"
