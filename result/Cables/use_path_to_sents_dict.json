I came across these wing nuts here but didn't purchase them because a customer stated they were just big enough to cap a #6 wire, but not to wire two wires together. I went to a local store, looked at them, purchased a bag of 10 and they worked well. I was able two splice a 6/3 and 8/3 AWG stranded wires together without issues and the wing nuts held them really tight. To make it easier, I used a two gang electrical box, stripped about 1-1/2\" of the wire insulation, used two pliers: one to hold the wires together and a lineman's pliers to twist the wires as tight possible, used a rotary Dreamel tool and wheel to cut about 3/4-inch of the twisted wire at about 45 degree angle (the wheel made a cleaner cut than with a cutter, at least for the stranded wires. Also cutting it at 45 degree ensured wires went inside wing nut easier). Spliced all wires, two black, two red and two white using these wing nuts and it was much easier than I thought. Didn't use them for the ground wire because it's a #10 wire and I already have a green wing nut. But they worked well and I recommend them.",

Well, you can imagine the mess in that box if I'd done it all w/wire nuts! I had to use pigtails on the line, neutral and ground wires. That meant 4 wires bound together for line, 6 for neutral, 6 for ground. Using these made that process easy and clean. I also used the Wago 221-412 lever nuts connecting the pigtails to the switches. Since each switch needed 4 connectors, the small Wagos made it very easy! As always, do things meticulously when doing wiring! Always visually ensure the all wires are inserted fully into each connector. After you push each connector bunch into the box, validate all wires are still fully inserted and on the 221s, ensure the levers are shut. Love these!"

I had bought 2 packs :'-( The ones that I did use were excellent! I had to splice (3) 10G wires and (1) 18G wire together near a small goldfish pond (read, moist soil), and this fit perfectly and screwed on nice and tight. The caulk on the inside sealed them up perfectly, so even after burying them in the wet soil there was no voltage drop. As others said, the caulk is SUPER sticky!! After I screwed each one on, though, I picked up some dirt and rubbed it in to my hands; that worked fine to remove the stickiness, and washed off later with no problem. I kind of think that I could have saved some money by using regular wire nuts and just squirting silicone caulk in it before screwing in the wire, but I'm not positive it would have been the same. These were good for the job, though, I just wish that I would have realized that I had overpurchased earlier so I could at least return one of the packs.",

        "Bending cables in close quarters<<<Small enough to fit in tight spaces|||B00QW2AZ9G ★★★☆☆ [2020-06-20] <b>Works some of the time but far from perfect</b> I had been going to make something similar to this but never got around to it. I had a couple projects coming up that were going to need some close quarters cable bending so I broke down and bought the Bend-All. It works at least some of the time and has saved effort – but it is far from perfect. First off, it is expensive for what it is. (That was painful but it only hurts once.) It seems unnecessarily big and clunky. It does not always fit in where it needs to go. Proportions could be better if it were a steel forging instead of being machined from an aluminum block. (How many of your other wrenches are machined from aluminum?) The posts have serrations on them to help keep them from slipping on the cable. Unfortunately, as the cable is bent, it needs to slide on one of the posts. This tends to dig in and damage the insulation. I put a piece of heat shrink tubing on one of the posts which seemed to help. Having one of the posts free to rotate would probably be even better. This tool is rated for up to 350 MCM conductors. I have only used it on 4/0. For my use, having a smaller version with the posts a bit closer together would be better. It would be nice if there were small recesses machined on the sides of the square drive hole for the ball detent on the socket wrench extension to engage in order to help keep the Bend-All from falling off. Overall, in spite of its shortcomings not a bad tool to have in your kit, but don’t expect miracles.",

I ran liquid tight conduit from the panel to the firepit, it's unnecessary as this cable is made for direct burial, however I wanted the added protection as it's near our pool plumbing and wiring, and also wanted the option to pull additional wire if necessary. I ran the conduit from underground up the side of the posts, since they are backfilled with concrete I wanted the ability to pull wire through if something needed to be replaced rather than having the wire itself ran through the concrete and up the post.

It seemed more like one very thick layer, at least double normal wire insulation thickness, and much tougher. Polyethylene is not a cheap material. I expect to use a cutting wheel even to strip the ends. Inside is a single conductor which they say is galvanized steel, not the usual conductor materials of aluminum or copper.

A small family of raccoons can easily do $500-worth of damage in a single night, so it needs to be as protected as we can get it. The low-impedance charger is in the barn, with a lead wire taking the charge out to the fence. That would work OK without some of this wire - until we took the tractor or pickup out to pick some corn for the stand. For that, a drive-thru gate is needed. A buried wire/cable is the most practical way to build one of those, IF the wire is designed to be buried, as this one is. We won't need the fence for six months, so I haven't had a chance to actually use it yet. But, this looks to be much stronger and more durable, less prone to breakage from driving over it, than any gate wire we've used so far. An excellent value.",

I used this to form 2 double cinch knots for fastening to my fiberglass fish to grip the cable. This twine is very sturdy, stays in knots, is easily unknotted when finished with the project. It was a shame to purchase 500' of this for my solo need, but well worth the spending considered the performance of product and ease of use. This will work extremely well for long line pulls through all kinds of tubing, as it is quite sturdy and accepts the electrical lube. As normal procedure, before use take a lighter and seal the end to keep it from fraying-any nylon product."

I tested the wire's resistance and per the American Wire Gauge (AWG) Table, I should get 6.4 ohms resistance per 1000 feet of 18 gauge wire. I don't have a multimeter sensitive enough to measure just 23 feet of wire as in this kit, but my multimeter was bouncing between .1 and .2 ohms. Right in the ballpark of .14 ohms for 23 feet that I calculate I should have. Sorry I didn't have enough hands to measure the wire and get a picture too. I also held the wire over a flame for several seconds. The insulation stood up just fine without and visible damage to the wire. The wire itself is very flexible and I like the silicone insulation. I didn't think too much of the little wire stripper/cutter included in the kit. But, it will work if you don't already have proper tools. The little zip ties are handy, but so few won't last too long! One more thing is I thought the kit is a little spendy for what you get. But, if you need several colors of wire, but not much of it, this may work for you. Better than buying several larger rolls that you don't end up using most of.

The PVC insulation is tough and will stand up to abrasion. This cable should not be used for line voltage applications as the insulation is not rated for that application. I use 14/2 cable in my landscape lighting for the final connections to groups of LED fixtures. I use 12/2 for distribution over long distances to get to the clusters of fixtures. 14/2 works great in that application and helps to save a little money compared to running 12/2 everywhere. If your cable runs are all short and you have a modest number of LED fixtures then 14/2 may be good enough for the entire system. Note that 14/2 cable has a lower current rating than 12/2 cable, which is counterintuitive given the numbers are getting smaller as ampacity increases.

I tested the wire's resistance and per the American Wire Gauge (AWG) Table, I should get 6.4 ohms resistance per 1000 feet of 18 gauge wire. I don't have a multimeter sensitive enough to measure just 23 feet of wire as in this kit, but my multimeter was bouncing between .1 and .2 ohms. Right in the ballpark of .14 ohms for 23 feet that I calculate I should have. Sorry I didn't have enough hands to measure the wire and get a picture too. I also held the wire over a flame for several seconds. The insulation stood up just fine without and visible damage to the wire. The wire itself is very flexible and I like the silicone insulation. I didn't think too much of the little wire stripper/cutter included in the kit. But, it will work if you don't already have proper tools. The little zip ties are handy, but so few won't last too long! One more thing is I thought the kit is a little spendy for what you get. But, if you need several colors of wire, but not much of it, this may work for you. Better than buying several larger rolls that you don't end up using most of. Overall, a solid product that I can recommend, given the above comments. In my book, a solid 4 star product, very useful and a quality product. But, nothing too special. This product was provided to me through the Amazon Vine Program, on which I only pay the taxes on this product."

Heated the connector until the solder melted, then heated the ends to make sure it was tight around the wires. Much easier than soldering separately and using heat shrink tubing. Much better than using crimp connectors."

Be sure you know what you're buying. This is ultra flexible, with many super-fine strands and silicone rubber insulation marked 200C (higher than PVC but lower than PTFE). The fine strands (150 of them, but I didn't count!) can be a bit of a challenge when crimping contacts... make sure no microscopic strands escape the crimp -- then it works great. The insulation is thick but soft: very easy to work with but also easily damaged if used in the wrong application. It's the right cable for routing in tight locations, since it's so willing to bend and lay flat... good for DIY drones (flexing arms or retracting legs) or making wiring harnesses that need to flex but are well protected from abrasion and pinching. For more rugged high-temp insulation, consider PTFE but it is much more difficult to work with and hard to find at a reasonable price. As noted by others, some colors are a bit off. Red is clearly orange, and blue is gray-purple. That's okay for my purposes, but maybe not if you are building to a print for assemblies that will be inspected. The velcro wraps keep each spool neat, and the box is good for organizing these spools when lots of other wire spools are around."

Heck maybe it is even dark red, idk the point is it is not the clearly red red of the same brand's other gauges. That's not a nitpick; when circuits get complex these distinctions are crucial. Red is the color i use for positive power in my projects. Once i get a street map of wires on the back of perfboard i can confuse my own self just fine without also having to suss out ambiguous wire colors. I've attached a photo to illustrate. I wanted to make a side-by-side comparison to my 24 gauge wire but couldn't get the lighting right to show the contrast. Doesn't matter... when i opened the box i thought, \"that's orange wire\".

I putter around with offgrid solar power and battery setups, have several at home in addition to my grid-tied system and like to help friends set their own systems up as well. For that you really need some good heavy high-quality copper wire, because once you get the system down to 12 or 24v, you need to pull quite a few amps to power reasonable-sized inverters, and that means thick copper, and sometimes multiple strands of it. I create my own power cables using copper crimping ends, sometims with two parallel 4AWG lenghs used in parallel as a single cable, and kept as short as feasible. This cable works well for that. It’s reasonably flexible and seems to take the power just fine. I consider copper to be a precious metal; won’t be all that long until it costs a lot more than it does now, because the ore grades are falling inexorably around the world, it’s getting more energetically remote. So I think of owning spare high-quality copper wires as an investment for the future just like gold or silver, only a lot more useful and a lot cheaper.

So, it is basically as advertised ... but still, not exactly what I wanted. For bodging and wrapping electronic projects, it is better to have thinner insulation ... the jacket on this wire is exceptionally thick for the gauge.

AKA: You’re alright using this outside; even burying it underground. The wire jackets/sheathing itself are robust and flexible as with the primary jacket/sheath. It also has a good bit of copper (tin also) in its makeup. This on paper and upon observation this is very good wire. I wouldn’t use it to jump a car battery, or wire up a competition car audio system (been there, done that, and was a garage manager) but low power on/off applications in all weather environments, you’re going to be just fine.

        "Low-power circuits|||B0C7T9YK2N ★★★☆☆ [2023-10-14] <b>Fine wire, but a little skimpy on the amount, with poorly thought out dispenser</b> First; just as an admission, I usually work on low-power circuits and use much thinner wire (22 gauge or above). However, it's good to have some thicker wire around for those times you have to move a lot of current, so I ordered the 18-gauge silicone wire. As for the wire itself, it seems high quality, with decent insulation. It's pre-tinned, which supposedly makes it easier to solder, though I didn't notice a huge difference (see video). It's nice that it comes with some heat-shrink in the same colors, for those times when you can't hide your wires from view. It even comes with colored zip ties, though I see less of a use for these. On the downside, the spools aren't that full; it's only 10 ft of wire, which frankly isn't that much. It'd be much more useful if they filled the spools. Like other wire assortments, the box this comes in doubles as a dispenser. However, it's kind of a disaster. Instead of aligning the spools vertically side by side, they lay the spools flat, with the wires coming out both sides. It's a little hard to explain the geometry of it all, but the spools get jumbled up much more easily, the box doesn't stay closed as firmly, and it's a pain to respool the wire if you've accidentally pulled out too much. There's a reason practically every wire assortment puts the spools side-by-side; it just plain works better. So while this is fine wire, i'd really recommend looking for a kit with a decent dispenser and more than 10ft per spool.",

I bought the 50 foot spool of thermostat wire for that project from a big box store. This item’s packaging, in contrast, comes in a cardboard box of significantly smaller dimension than the big box store’s spool of wire, which was in a clear plastic bag. As seen in the photo, the box is maybe 5 inches square and about a couple inches tall. I gave some thought to this. If I were an HVAC contractor, I think the smaller footprint of this item’s design would be a better approach for easy storage when in the field. But the downside to this is the wire’s coiled memory may make fishing the wire a bit more challenging than the wider diameter of the big box version. Aside from this interesting but probably trivial difference, this item seems perfect for its intended purpose. It strips well with the usual wire stripper tools. Continuity was verified with all five conductors. The conductors’ colors match industry standard. Coming from the aforesaid DIYer here, I guess you can take that with a healthy grain of salt :) but I think we’re on page that this the right design for thermostats needing five conductors. I intend to use this item to re-wire an existing smart thermostat installation at a different property, where the existing wiring is rather amusing but functional. I think this item is up to the task and look forward to using it. I think it will also serve me well when I take on some nifty Arduino project with external sensors that need to be wired up. All kinds of cool possibilities here. Glad I picked this item."

Having an assortment of wire on hand helps ensure I'm using the right wire for the job both in function and appearance (color coding). This assortment includes 8 spools of silicone insulated 18AWG wire in different colors, along with heatshrink tubing and wire ties in matching colors which is a nice touch for neater, more professional looking wiring jobs. The spools are included in a box with holes to allow for dispensing, but the spools lay flat in the box -- not on edge like other boxes of dispensable wire I have. This isn't really an issue, just an odd choice and it makes the box a bit wider and flatter compared to a vertical orientation. Also included is a very basic wire stripper, though I don't use it as I have more capable wire strippers at hand. I would tend to challenge the specs/rating sheet included. Generally I wouldn't suggest anywhere near 22A be run through 18AWG wire. More like half that, tops. While the silicone insultation will help reduce the chance of fire from an over current situation compared to PVC or other materials, it will still get very hot and is a grossly inefficient application of power, with so much energy being lost as heat due to the resistance of the wire. Further, seeing the recommendation here could lead the inexperienced to conclude that's a safe current for any similarly sized wire. Otherwise, I'm quite satisfied with this product."

        "Oven outlet<<<Rated for up to 55 Amps|||B0D2LVRXBC ★★★★★ [2023-02-02] <b>Just a note</b> Its wire, not much to review, I just wanted to mention a note to other buyers or my future self. No fault to the seller or product, Amazon had the “order this + this + this” option for the end connectors and clamps, which you’ll also need, but it gives you a wrong size for the end clamps. The 3/4” mounting straps are the right size, but 3/4” ends to secure this 6/3 MC cable to your metal boxes is way to big. I ended up having to make a trip to the hardware store to buy smaller 1/2” end clamps instead of the 3/4” ones Amazon was recommending. I love working with MC cable, but its always a pain trying to determine the correct size anti short bushings, end caps, mounting straps etc to go with it. The sizes are all over the place depending on the gauge and number of wires and none of the sellers actually specify what size additional parts are needed to match up with it. As a side note, its also always confusing how sometimes it’ll state (for example) “6/3 wire” where you’d expect it to be three #6 wires total but in reality there are 4 wires, black, red, white and green. There isn’t always consistency in this, sure would be a lot easier if the standard was to count the actual number of wires, including the ground. This 6/3 MC cable in particular is actually four total 6 AWG wires, black, red, white, green for those that aren’t sure. It’s also rated for up to 55 Amps, which is perfect for wiring in a 50 amp RV, Dryer, or Oven outlet. Even if say your dryer outlet only requires 2 hots and a ground (6/2) with no neutral (old style), go ahead and run this (6/3) wire anyhow and just don’t use the extra wire, you’ll be doing yourself a future proof favor for the day when you replace that old appliance and discover the new one requires all 4 wires. Easier, and cheaper to just not use the extra wire now than trying to add another wire later."

I get rapid and random pause and start. Lots of time spent troubleshooting. After running the cord around the other side of the bench a maximum distance from the VFD, things improved. It's not completely good, but I'm hoping some ferrite cores will finish it off. Don't expect this cable to have great shielding, and you may still run into problems if you have a source of high EMI. I should have spent 2X or 3X the cost and got better cable."

The wire is bright and shiny and I feel no pits when I pull it through my fingers. I stretched about 6 inches between the alligator clips of a lab power supply set at 12 volts. It pulled about 900ma which means for that length of wire (eye-balled not measured) resistance is about 13 ohms. It glowed bright red. Note that wire increases in resistance as it is heated so this measurement will be higher than with an ohmmeter. I wrapped it around a pair of needle-nose pliers and pulled until it gave way. It required a few pounds of tension. Easily strong enough to use to cut Styrofoam, my opinion. I don't think copper will like the heat of a direct connection. For cutting Styrofoam, I think I would wrap it around a small length of steel wire and then push it through a steel butt connector and clamp it tight. Then attach the copper wire to the steel wire.",

Things that you often would use your stepladder to do can be done by these and thus free up the use of your ladder for what it is intended. It is sturdy enough to work hard but not so expensive that you worry about leaving overnight at a site. You will probably end up doing some customizing, such as with the two metal pins that join the sections to make a stand, I drilled them in the center and put a monofilament line on them to tether them to a handle so they do not get lost. I also put some screws through the base into the sub-floor when I am pulling stiff cable to keep it from sliding. Overall, the slots and shaping make this a very helpful temporary rig.

They are very thick and sturdy, and are stable in all of the different configurations they're designed for. I have just two little nits about these: 1. There are two small steel bars that act as connecting pegs, to hold the two plates together vertically. They don't get used often, so there's a very good chance they'll get lost. There are a couple of indented areas on each plate that look like the bars should be stored in; but the bars just fall out. There's nothing to hold them in. With all of the careful, thoughtful, designing that went into this system; I'm amazed this wasn't dealt with. 2. The two halves clip together nicely, but there's no good way to store them. The assembly is still very bulky and awkward, even after disassembling it and clipping the two halves together -- and they will fall apart if you try to hang them up. Bottom line: A couple of little issues that should be considered; but still an amazingly useful product.",

A solution that can support a broad variety of wire diameters is provided by the design, which can accommodate spools with a diameter of up to 34 inches. The load capability of 330 pounds per pair guarantees that even heavy spools are well-supported, which contributes to a dispensing experience that is both smooth and regulated. The sturdy structure and careful design provide a stable platform for the wire spools, which eliminates the possibility of the wire spools swaying or toppling while they are being dispensed. Without causing any kinking or tangling, the dispensing process itself is smooth, making it possible to unwind without any difficulty. Since I started using this wire spool caddy, I have seen a discernible improvement in the way that my workstation is designed and organized. In order to improve my work process and reduce the amount of time I spend looking for and untangling wires, it is helpful to have the capability to stack numerous spools and have them immediately accessible.

Unfortunately, while they got lots right, the product feels half baked; while it can be very useful now, hopefully the next version will correct some of the following shortcomings. The location on the rack for storing the stand stacking pins does NOT work, because the channel where they go is wider than the pins' diameter, so they just fall out. In other words, there is no mechanical catch or other device to hold the pins in their storage location. This problem could have been easily fixed with four small 3/8 to ½ inch button magnet, one pair at each end of the two storage channels. A quick search shows that four rare earth magnets would add only slightly more than 1 cent ($0.0125) to the materials cost of the product. My other initial concern is will the ¾ to 1 inch conduit or rigid pipe they recommend for suspending spools of wire between the supports stay in place if the wire is pulled off the spools at an angle toward either support vs perpendicular to the support pipe and parallel to the supports or will the pipe slip out of the hole in the stand."

It has the preferred characteristics of copper (low resistance and flexibility) with the corrosion resistance of tin. I have had to throw away pure copper wire from the 70s since it develops green oxidation and is a pain to clean but have yet to have to clean tinned copper before crimping or soldering. This wire has fewer strands that are larger and a heavy PVC outer coating, compared to the small strand silicon coated wire I use for RC helicopters. This makes it stiffer, easier to route, and tougher. I wouldn't hesitate to walk on this wire or pull it across metal edges that would cut silicon insulation. The larger strands are also better for crimping since smaller strands are more likely to break at the crimp. The only negative is the large outer diameter will limit the number of runs you can have in small spaces. Excellent wire! Recommended!"

It is strong and still bendable. A little harder than I want, but still works well. My only complaint is that the plastic on the packaging makes this look a lot shinier than it is. After you work with it a bit it gets even duller. However, while isn’t good for jewelry it is fantastic for framing and supporting other things like sculptures, internal wiring for other wire projects I'm still getting excellent use out of it even of it isn't good for what I bought it for."

I have quite a few rolls of this awful wire. It's certainly not attractive for a nice stone I would give it no stars, but it's not the company's fault that some Joe schmoo said use cheap wire. Your project will look like it was made in a garage. Terrible info and video teaching random wrapping.

        "Firing earrings in bead rack<<<Melts at high temperatures|||B088GTYS9N ★☆☆☆☆ [2024-05-03] <b>NOT HIGH FIRE!!! - DONT EVEN BOTHER</b> Due to the inconsistencies in reviews (some stated that it fires well to cone 6, others saying it bent/melted at even lower temps), I was 50/50 on what I was getting. I decided to try myself and see. However, firing to cone 6 myself, I can attest now that it is NOT a high fire wire! I used it as in a bead rack to fire earrings and it completely melted and my pieces fell to the shelf (thank God for kiln cookies!!) I did the same with the Kemper high temp wire, which funny enough is rated at a lower temperature (1196°C) in the the same firing and it worked flawlessly!! I would say it is my fault for firing pieces on a product I wasn't certain about but I look back now and see this is Amazon and the suppliers fault for 1) Amazon recommending this product as \"Amazon's Choice\" and 2) The manufacturer's false advertising of this material as a \"HIGH TEMP\", \"NICHROME\", AND \"1200C RESISTANCE\" when it in fact is not. I'm assuming it works for lower temps however it is definitely not made to stand to its description of 1200C (AKA cone 6)!! Overall don't waste your time with this product. Just stick to KEMPER. Side Note - I acknowledge that some customers used this product and had no issues. However this is not a good justification for purchasing it as I did. The fact of the matter is that a business should be selling their products consistently and as advertised, there should not be this much discourse into if a product is true to its claims!!"

This kit is particularly appealing for its thoughtful compilation of essential wiring needs, presented in a user-friendly package. Variety and Quality: One of the standout features of this kit is the variety it offers—eight colors of 18 gauge silicone wire, each extending to 23 feet (7 meters). While the length of each spool might not cater to extensive projects, the assortment allows for ample experimentation and small-scale builds. The choice of silicone for the wire sheathing is a commendable one, providing a durable, heat-resistant covering that forgives the occasional soldering mishap, making it an ideal selection for beginners. Additionally, silicone's chemical resistance and flexibility are qualities that veteran electronics enthusiasts will appreciate. Accessories and Utility: The inclusion of color-coordinated heat shrink tubing and zip ties adds a layer of organization and professionalism to projects, enhancing the overall utility of the kit. While the wire stripper may not impress seasoned users, it's a valuable addition for those just starting, offering an all-in-one solution to basic wiring needs. Packaging and Design: The kit's packaging is notably well-conceived, featuring a box with holes for each wire spool, facilitating easy access and storage. This system helps maintain a clean and organized workspace, a boon for any project. However, the opportunity for improvement lies in the visibility of the remaining wire on each spool; a clear plastic window on the box would have perfectly rounded out the design by allowing users to gauge their wire stock at a glance. Conclusion: In summary, the 18 Gauge Wire Kit earns a solid five-star rating not through groundbreaking innovation but through the thoughtful assembly of high-quality components tailored to meet the needs of both novice and experienced electronics enthusiasts. It stands out as a comprehensive and practical kit, perfect for anyone looking to embark on or expand their electronics projects with a reliable selection of wires and tools at their disposal."

It is lightweight and doesn't qualify for use as the wiring in a house and isn't rated to be used outdoors. I wonder why they say it is good for marine usage if it can't be used outdoors. All I can figure is it may be used if concealed from the weather, such as under the sides of a boat or inside a houseboat. It wouldn't be acceptable for a boat trailer, however, as the wires are exposed to the elements there. We chose to use the wire for the new speaker system for our television. My adult son and I live together and he wired the speakers. He said it was very easy with this wire as it stripped easily and didn't break any when he wrapped the ends around the terminals. I have to take his word for this as I certainly don't know anything about it!! Next, he plans to rewire the LED lights under our countertops. They don't carry enough current to count as house wiring. All in all, this is great wire for general use. It is nice to have available for things that may pop up. Who knows, I may have a need for some brightly colored wire for a craft project, too!!

The cable is easy to work with using a good set of wire insulation removers (Amazon won't let me post what they really are called). The name of the one I used in the attached video is \"Capri Tools 20010 Precision Wire...\". I've used them for a few years now and I'll never go without one again. Best $30 ever spent on wire tools.

        "12V wiring projects<<<16 Gauge wire|||B0CLBHT8YX ★★★★☆ [2024-03-27] <b>Good for small projects</b> It seems I'm always scrounging for sections of wire on different RV projects and usually find something leftover from an older finished project that works but maybe is not the best (such as by adding pigtails). This has 5 fifty foot rolls of 5 colors that should end the scrounging. This is a copper clad aluminum core (CCA) wire. The copper reduces corrosion caused by moisture and oxidation and adds surface conductivity. I got it to use for some small 12V wiring projects in the RV (additional 12 volt computer fan for gas refrigerator cooling) and to have on hand when I just need some short lengths of wire. For reference, Cu Clad Al (CCA) wire can be used for main wire projects but at a much larger gauge as aluminum has a higher resistance than copper. 12 AWG is recommended for a 15 Amp 110V circuit and 10 AWG for a 20 Amp. This is a 36 strand 16 AWG braided wire so it's not made for heavy loads or 110 volt wiring. Specs are for up to 80 volts. The wire is flexible and there's enough copper coating for it to solder easily to itself. If there's trouble having the wire stick, a copper infused solder works. I used some lead free Rosin Core 2.0 Sn99 Ag0.3 Cu0.7 electronics solder and everything was sucked into the wire and stuck together. I couldn't find the percent by weight of copper anywhere on the rolls, package, or website. The range for CCA is anywhere from 10% to 24% by weight, with the more the better (but also more expensive). 15 small zip ties and 10 heat shrink tubes are included in the box. I'm never going to use this on a main AC wiring project but for small electrical projects, it's a good economical choice and should last a long time. If you don't want 5 colors and a dispenser box, 4-color roll packages of 100'/roll 16AWG of this brand are the same price if you shop around. 4 stars - copper specs not given."

It is tinned, so if you plan to solder, that is even better. I am using this as a signal wire from remote/pendant mounted switches to control small relays. For this, it is well suited, possibly a little overkill. But I like having a little heavier gage than what it takes just to get the job done. In my experience, it lasts longer and more forgiving to unexpected issues and faults. The outer sheath is not terribly difficult to cut, but I do not think average use will cause damage to it. Probably not suited to use in a manufacturing plant where it would be subjected to many types of abuse. But for the average DIY home entrepreneur, it would likely be just fine. I think we all take better care of things when it is us who foot the bill to pay for them. The individual wires are color coded (think thermostat wire), so they are easily identifiable on each end.

It is tinned, so if you plan to solder, that is even better. I am using this as a signal wire from remote/pendant mounted switches to control small relays. For this, it is well suited, possibly a little overkill. But I like having a little heavier gage than what it takes just to get the job done. In my experience, it lasts longer and more forgiving to unexpected issues and faults. The outer sheath is not terribly difficult to cut, but I do not think average use will cause damage to it. Probably not suited to use in a manufacturing plant where it would be subjected to many types of abuse. But for the average DIY home entrepreneur, it would likely be just fine. I think we all take better care of things when it is us who foot the bill to pay for them. The individual wires are color coded (think thermostat wire), so they are easily identifiable on each end. As mentioned they are tinned, so the are easily soldered as well. I like soldered connections.

The ice slab slides onto the cutting grid with enough energy to make a considerable \"thud\" that can be hear in the next room. I attribute the failed wire to this aggressive blow from the ice slab. I bought this wire vs paying the 200 dollars (plus shipping) for the entire cutting grid assembly from Marvel. This wire matched the factory wire in diameter (close enough). I didn't compare the ohm value of the new wire to the factory wire. I just knew the combined resistance of the parallel grids needed to be between 3.9-4.5 ohms. Stringing the failed grid took some trial and error (first attempt, i broke the wire). I eventually got a method to tighten each \"run\". The overall resistance was right at 4.5 ohms. The wire is tough and reasonably difficult to break. I was pulling the runs with hemostatic clamps and the wire held up. I only broke it when i was attempting to wrap around a screw too aggressively. I am two weeks in and it is making ice without issue. This is a good option to repair if you don't mind having a little time in it.",

I putter around with offgrid solar power and battery setups, have several at home in addition to my grid-tied system and like to help friends set their own systems up as well. For that you really need some good heavy high-quality copper wire, because once you get the system down to 12 or 24v, you need to pull quite a few amps to power reasonable-sized inverters, and that means thick copper, and sometimes multiple strands of it. I create my own power cables using copper crimping ends, sometims with two parallel 4AWG lenghs used in parallel as a single cable, and kept as short as feasible. This cable works well for that. It’s reasonably flexible and seems to take the power just fine. I consider copper to be a precious metal; won’t be all that long until it costs a lot more than it does now, because the ore grades are falling inexorably around the world, it’s getting more energetically remote. So I think of owning spare high-quality copper wires as an investment for the future just like gold or silver, only a lot more useful and a lot cheaper. This is a good example of very useful copper cable, recommended to those setting up solar panels and inverters.",

It had to be tinned, flexible, and preferably zip cord. This hits all the high points. Since this is used only when I deploy my solar panels, the silicon insulation shouldn't degrade from the UV. The strands are VERY small making it difficult to solder, but that makes it more flexible which is what I wanted. Overall, a great purchase."

The product description describes LED lights applications. Mine is different. I am using this for connecting a Volt/Amp meter to a low voltage solar charging station. Three wires are perfect because the meter only uses three for sensing. A fourth is used for power. I will use a separate low voltage cable for that. I like the fact that the three sensing wires are joined together to form a neat connection -- no wires all over the place spaghetti fashion.

The wire is flexible, stranded, copper (each strand is tinned) and should have no issues meeting the power and temperature specs. 10 gauge is far more than most people will need for most basic RV wiring, but if you aren't sure, check with an electrician. I added pictures of the strands, before and after applying high heat. Note, the end of the strands ball up, which is a trait of copper, not aluminum. The tinning is easily burned from the wire to show the copper core. This is good stuff, actually great, considering what I see as the price of around 34 bucks. I'm pleasantly surprised!"

Tinned copper keeps oxidation low while also enduring the elements, and the high heat threshold allows me to route through the engine compartment without worry (around the body of the car, not across the engine). Although 12 gauge is a bit high for speaker wire, a lower gauge in the same wire would be great for car stereo or boat speakers."

I am a DIYer who always has low voltage projects. I order different wires and connectors all the time. Some products are listed as tinned copper but turn out to be CCA. This cable is, in fact, tinned copper. I've been using this cable for some of my fog lights. I have a solar setup in my car with fog lights and light bars. Some of my lights are permanently installed. I wanted a set on a long cable that attaches with magnets. This goves me the option to move them around and change their placement depending on my needs. The long cable allows me to move my lights from my trunk to my roof or my hood. The cable is well made and has held up great even through the winter. I would order this again for future projects."

If you are doing nothing more than running speaker wire, then good for you. You should be happy with the cable. If you are running power wire for an appliance, a solar system, or for any standard project other than low voltage battery, you will have to pause and wonder. What is the voltage rating? What is the current rating? Is this really OFC or something else? You can think it is something, but you will NOT know for sure. If you have an inspector ask for the ratings, you are out of luck and will have to rewire your project. The company says that it is 10 GA Oxygen free copper and they say the rating on the insulation is 200V. So, the problems start when you look at Silicon insulation and find that the normal low voltage rating is 600V up to 35,000V. 200V does not appear in any standard. Most oxygen free tinned copper still looks like copper when you cut it. This cable does not do that, even with a magnifying glass. So, how do you know? Nothing on the cable indicates that it is OFC or anything other than 10GA. Ok, once you get that resolved in your mind, this cable is designed like lamp zip cord except it splits way too easily. Great concept, but you will need to secure the cable ends somehow if you do not want it pulling apart. You can use electrical tape, shrink tubing, or even a tie wrap not pulled too tight. The cable itself is very flexible, like you would expect from a silicon wire. For use in a solar system where there is NO ground and you are required to install a breaker on both the negative and the positive side of the supply, this type of cable works very well. In fact, it is the project I started using it on until the Building inspector asked to see the data sheet on the wire or at least the UL number. Since I could not produce it, I had to remove what I had done and switch to a UL rated cable. Does that make this a bad product? No, it only makes it a quesitonable product since you do not know exactly what you have. I have not been able to find a way to directly contact the company to ask for a spec sheet. I just hope they watch the reviews and can provide the requested item, then this would be a product I would recommend. Until then, I cannot recommend it."

        "Low voltage applications|||B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ [2024-02-14] <b>Quality wire in a durable jacket</b> I acquired this cable to wire some repair some existing lights and add supplemental warning lights on my tractor. Wire for rear tractor lighting needs to be run along the underside where brush, sticks, briars claw away at it constantly. More than once, I have had wiring damaged or destroyed. I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications. I really like this wire, and I look forward to using it to upgrade my tractor warning lights in preparation for spring. It would be equally suitable for use on a mowers or trailers as well. I think this product will provide adequate protection for wiring in a tough environment for a long time. In fact, with good end connections, I am hopeful that it will last as long as the equipment.",
        "Alternative to in-wall wiring|||B079NXCN6B ★★★★★ [2020-02-09] <b>Choose Your Location Well</b> Choosing a strategic location for the Ghost Wire can affect its visibility. I tried to butt it against corners, door frames, and base board to minimize its visibility. Likes: It gets the job done without needing to drill through walls, floors, or ceilings and then \"fish\" for speaker wire behind the wall or between joists; After working out the first connection to a terminal, the rest of them were easy to do; When I connected my speakers, it worked the first time and I have had no problems with the sound; Without doing any feathering or texturing, It took a coat of paint and matched the existing wall color perfectly (I have to point out the tape to people in order to get them to notice that it's there.) Dislikes: Although we had freshly painted walls (professionally done), the adhesive likes to come loose in a few places even though it was thoroughly pressed against the wall upon installation (It's not the worst thing in the world but I don't like to see any gap between the tape and the wall); I needed a little more Ghost Wire than was on the 100' reel so I ordered another 25' which is not on a reel and had a lot more bubbling (didn't easily lay flat on the wall); At over a buck per linear foot, it is a bit too pricey to use in every room; the folded corners do have a tendency to stand out, literally. NOTE: You still need speaker wire to run from the terminals to the speakers (I have wall mounted speakers and use about 1 foot of regular wire per speaker) and from the terminals on the other end to the amplifier or other source. If you order banana plugs (either solid or braided wire) with the terminals, the plugs do not fit into the holes in the terminals and you have to use bare wire. If they would manufacture the terminals with slightly larger holes, it would be excellent. Maybe someday they will.",
        "Low voltage applications|||B0CH2R3XNH ★★★★☆ [2023-11-18] <b>Copper Clad * ALUMINUM * for maybe 10 amps</b> This product sort of tricked me. I saw 12/2 wire and I’m just so used to everything being copper that I didn’t notice this listing is for CCA (Copper Clad Aluminum). That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but if - like me - you see 12 AWG and have a knee jerk expectation this can carry twenty amps then you’re going to be disappointed. That said, you don’t normally need that kind of amperage in a low voltage system anyway. What tipped me off was measuring the resistance. When I join the two ends of this roll to get a 240-ft loop, I measure 1.0 ohms (after subtracting out 0.1 for my test leads). That’s about double what I’d expect from 12 AWG copper, and puts it more in the neighborhood of 16 AWG copper. So we’re looking at wire here that can carry something in the neighborhood of ten amps — assuming you have enough voltage to even make that happen. This is a consideration that I don’t see mentioned in the product listing at the time of this writing. And that’s probably fine for most garden lighting projects (up to maybe 100W, hopefully not all going down one wire). LED lights these days really don’t use a whole lot of power. So if this product meets your needs then by all means go for it. I see nothing to complain about in terms of build quality and fully expect it to survive direct burial operation. I just want to make sure you’re not under-sizing your wire. And, just to be clear, this wire is for low voltage applications.

It worked out great. Are walls are brick with a stucco coating and our bulbs are 8w LEDs which are run at 30% and 50%. We only have one LED bulb that is run full power and it is run on its own wire and switch. We live in Mexico and it is not against code, but if you are concerned I would check with your local code. In addition this is an adult houshold (no kids), so we are aware of what his hooked up, and treat it accordingly. I know Sewell says not for 120v, but I am sure that is a safety statement so they do not get sued if something ever was to go wrong or was not installed properly. If I was to do it again I would sand the wall and ceiling where the wire will lay down to give a completely flat finish. By doing this I believe it would be completely invisible after painting as the thickness of the wire would not ahow up !nd allow a perfectly transparent finish. My experience is if you lay it on top of the texture it will be visible from some angles, but mostly it is almost invisible.",

After cleaning the walls, installing and painting it looked reasonably good. Sure there was a visible bump, but with pictures and knick-knacks breaking up the visual space it wasn't noticeable unless you were looking for it. Over time (several months to a few years), however, the wire just started peeling off. It took a lot of time to be sure, but especially on exterior walls (which get colder than the ambient temperature of the room) they came completely detached in sections. Still using them while I look for a better solution, but it looks ridiculous on the exterior wall where it's almost completely fallen off.",

I like that it's heat resistant but and doesn't kink easily. The trade-off is that it doesn't \"behave\" like regular plastic-coated wire BECAUSE the silicone doesn't kink easily. The wire WILL bend but it's slightly more challenging to work with because of the silicone. Also, if the silicone takes a hard bend, I doubt it will show it like the plastic-coated wire. If plastic-coated wire gets \"smashed\" you can see the damage to the sheath and wire. Overall, I think I like it.

In my case, I just wanted some hobbyist DIY low voltage wiring to run between some of the 5V USB connectors I've been messing with in kits, etc. Might also use it for some other instances around the house and work bench. And even though it's rated for 300V, I'm not likely to use it for anything 120V or high amperage 12V use. 22G just seems a bit small for that. Good wire, tho, for lots of applications!"

Apparently, the builder's electrician used the same wire nuts (red) everywhere, regardless of how many wires were coming in. The problem is, there were several points where 6 wires needed to be joined. The red nuts that were used are not rated for more than 4 12-guage wires. Evidently, the electrician tried to compensate for that by twisting the wires together with pliers or something, but the connection was still flaky, which resulted in some flickering lights and unreliable outlets. These Gardner Bender blue wire nuts fixed the problem completely! I took the old small red wire nuts off in every place where I saw more than 4 wires being joined, then put these on, twisted by hand with a pretty strong force until I was not able to twist anymore, then closed all the boxes and tested with an electrical tester. All the connections were solid - no more flickering lights or unreliable outlets. I definitely recommend blue Gardner Bender wire nuts in every place where 5 to 6 common household wires (12 AWG) need to be joined together. The nuts are quite large, so keep that in mind. Typically I envision them being needed for neutral connections, as all neutrals typically go together while the hots are wired to different switches."

Apparently, the builder's electrician used the same wire nuts (red) everywhere, regardless of how many wires were coming in. The problem is, there were several points where 6 wires needed to be joined. The red nuts that were used are not rated for more than 4 12-guage wires. Evidently, the electrician tried to compensate for that by twisting the wires together with pliers or something, but the connection was still flaky, which resulted in some flickering lights and unreliable outlets. These Gardner Bender blue wire nuts fixed the problem completely! I took the old small red wire nuts off in every place where I saw more than 4 wires being joined, then put these on, twisted by hand with a pretty strong force until I was not able to twist anymore, then closed all the boxes and tested with an electrical tester. All the connections were solid - no more flickering lights or unreliable outlets. I definitely recommend blue Gardner Bender wire nuts in every place where 5 to 6 common household wires (12 AWG) need to be joined together. The nuts are quite large, so keep that in mind. Typically I envision them being needed for neutral connections, as all neutrals typically go together while the hots are wired to different switches."

I got out some Southwire Romex and compared the two. This Arizona branded wire was nearly identical. The outer jacket was cut and pulled back and the wire stripped just as easily as the Romex. The only difference I really noticed was the outer jacket of the Romex felt more slick or slippery to the Arizona wire.

At the moment, this 100 ft roll is cheaper by about $20 than the 100 ft of Romex. I will say if you can bump up to the 250 ft roll, that is usually the best deal, but sometimes that is just overkill for your project and a smaller roll works out better.

I’m not about to go and unravel this whole thing just to measure if they gave 50ft but based on what I am seeing, that appears to be the case. I like this wire, I know it will be useful in the future. I plan to use it to wire some outdoor lights in the sun room at my park model when it opens up again for the season. Upon inspection of the wire it appears brand new and there are no signs of damage anywhere on the wire. I’m not sure why this wire is tinned because generally you would utilize screw on caps in order to secure the junction between two wires in a home rough in environment.

        "Home appliances<<<Rated current of 12A|||B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ [2023-07-21] <b>Nice design</b> This product has proven to be an excellent choice for my electrical projects, offering several key features that make it stand out from other wires on the market. The use of tinned copper wire is a significant advantage of this silicone wire. The tin layer serves as a protective barrier for the inner oxygen-free copper, preventing it from being oxidized. This feature enhances the wire's longevity and ensures consistent performance over time, even in demanding conditions. The soft silicone insulator on this wire makes it highly flexible, making it easy to handle and maneuver during installations. This flexibility is a real benefit when working in tight spaces or intricate electrical setups, as it allows for smooth routing and minimizes the risk of wire kinking or damage. The availability of six different colors in the spools is a practical and thoughtful feature. It makes it easy to distinguish between wires and simplifies identification in complex wiring configurations. This color-coding system has been invaluable in my projects, enabling me to work more efficiently and avoid any potential wiring errors. With its rating for all under 600V devices and a rated current of 12A, this silicone wire is suitable for a wide range of applications. Whether it's low-voltage electronic projects, DIY circuits, or even some home appliances, this wire can handle the task with ease and reliability."

Dress up the cut surface, pull the wires back out, and secure a liquid-tight 1/2 in. compression end fitting to complete the process. Got it fitted to a 3x2x 3 1/2 in. deep switch box, attached thermostat wires, and good to go.

Being 10 gauge, this is what you would use to run to a dryer outlet or other device that requires a 30 amp circuit. You generally don't want to go over 75-80% load on a circuit so if you had a car charger that was 30 amp draw, you'd want 8 gauge wire instead. A number of years ago wire makers switched from round style 3 conductor jacket to this flat 3 conductor jacket. I found the old stuff a little easier to work with. I would recommend rolling out this wire, don't feed from the center of the roll. That will make pulling it through stud holes easier since the wire will be straighter.

Unfortunately, my house is full of poor wiring, so I have been working on getting everything up to par before I need to use my generator for an emergency. The wire comes in a plastic-wrapped roll with a couple bands around it. I'm used to Romex coming in the plastic roll that you can pull out of the middle, but this wasn't as easy as that. The wire is pliable, as I would expect 14 gauge wire to be, and it stripped well. I had to pull a number of lengths through flexible conduit and it was just stiff enough to push through without a fish tape if the conduit was straight. Overall, I give this wire high marks.

If you are doing nothing more than running speaker wire, then good for you. You should be happy with the cable. If you are running power wire for an appliance, a solar system, or for any standard project other than low voltage battery, you will have to pause and wonder. What is the voltage rating? What is the current rating? Is this really OFC or something else? You can think it is something, but you will NOT know for sure. If you have an inspector ask for the ratings, you are out of luck and will have to rewire your project. The company says that it is 10 GA Oxygen free copper and they say the rating on the insulation is 200V. So, the problems start when you look at Silicon insulation and find that the normal low voltage rating is 600V up to 35,000V. 200V does not appear in any standard. Most oxygen free tinned copper still looks like copper when you cut it. This cable does not do that, even with a magnifying glass. So, how do you know? Nothing on the cable indicates that it is OFC or anything other than 10GA. Ok, once you get that resolved in your mind, this cable is designed like lamp zip cord except it splits way too easily. Great concept, but you will need to secure the cable ends somehow if you do not want it pulling apart. You can use electrical tape, shrink tubing, or even a tie wrap not pulled too tight. The cable itself is very flexible, like you would expect from a silicon wire. For use in a solar system where there is NO ground and you are required to install a breaker on both the negative and the positive side of the supply, this type of cable works very well. In fact, it is the project I started using it on until the Building inspector asked to see the data sheet on the wire or at least the UL number. Since I could not produce it, I had to remove what I had done and switch to a UL rated cable. Does that make this a bad product? No, it only makes it a quesitonable product since you do not know exactly what you have. I have not been able to find a way to directly contact the company to ask for a spec sheet.

I love those old lamps that survived the test of time. Unfortunately, most are unsafe because age has destroyed the wiring and plugs, and of course, some never needed to pass a UL inspection.

It is flexy and easy to work with. It doesn't tangle/bulge internally and it coils sensibly. My wire gauge confirms it's 22awg. I plan to use this in my hobby of LED lighting controllers where this works well to send data, ground, and +VDC (5, 12, 24) to the strands from each transformer. I was pleased at the way this is packaged. Instead of being on a spool that explodes with released tension when uncoiled, this is on a larger plastic spool that's easy to \"tie off\" for reuse and very closely matches (coincidence?) the spools that LEDs come on, allowing them to live harmoniously in a box or standing on end in a file cabinet. The sheath strips nicely. The wires tin well. The cable doesn't sproing into a garage door spring at pressure when released from the package to use. It's a good price. If you need wire at the specifications listed, it's hard to go wrong here. While there are a number of variables involved, the required math is pretty straight-forward. 22G is about 43.4 ohms per km or 0.0434 ohms.per meter. Your project may not be running all channels at max brightness on all bulbs (RGB...and sometimes W) at the same time or it may be doing so for only a fraction of a second. Doing it for hours inside a packed conduit is different than an air-gapped conduit or being in the open. Just doing some quick math, let's imagine a 241 WS2812 project (like a Hexagon or a short strip) where each bulb is pulling .60ma per bulb (full intensity, white, and eye-torching white ON) That's a 14.5 W fixture at 24V, so you can use 22 gauge wire like this to drive 283feet and still lose only 1VDC at 24V. (It's worse at low voltages - this is why you want high voltages if wire length matters. It's the reason the power company lines to you are at 10's of thousands of volts....) If you're just doing boosters into taps, I'd imagine the distance to be even longer. 22Gauge is a good tradeoff of \"easy to work with\" and \"enough copper to deliver your electrons without resistance\" (hahahhaa. Ohm's Law jokes never get old.) I also did a spot test on painting it and it seems to take paint acceptably well. Some of this spool is probably going to end up in a permanent fixture that's tucked/painted into a corner of mine. This cable seems to be everything it claims to be and a nice set of specs for consumer lighting. Not fusable strands. Not chunky/expensive solid copper. Recommended."

I installed both the plug and socket slide on connectors without any difficulty. I did use a large pair of pliers to fully seat the cover of each connector. Tip: One side of the wire has a raised ridge. I aligned this side with the wider polarized plug/socket on the slide on connectors to ensure polarity was maintained at each connector. This is an important electrical safety feature that should be followed. Recently an ice storm interrupted power at my house for two days. My portable generator was able to provide electricity for only some parts of the house. The Wi-Fi router what is across the house and the outlets serving it did not have power. I used this extension cord at it’s full 50 foot length to run electricity from an energized outlet to my Wi-Fi router.

Time will tell how well the insulation will hold up to constant UV exposure but for now, no complaints and things are working with no issues."

I can store 3,000 ft worth of this wire with plugs on it in a tote versus only being able to put in 9 of the 100 ft extension cords from the stores back in the old days.

I have waterproof connectors that I use, but this is my first time using outdoor wiring. So far, it has rained last night and I didn't notice any issues. The lights worked all night long and when my transformer got the light of the day, it shut off well too. I needed this because I ran out of wire, so this extra makes me able to finalize my setup.

I have used wires before, and know how to strip wires (have a wire stripper and all) So, this worked really well for me. I have a transformer that I attached the wire to and I went around my yard with the wire making sure to leave a lot of slack for if I need to adjust the lights. I didn't bury it yet as I'm still adding lights, but so far, so good. I haven't had any issues with it fraying or being too hard to twist the strands together. They do as wires are supposed to do. I have waterproof connectors that I use, but this is my first time using outdoor wiring. So far, it has rained last night and I didn't notice any issues. The lights worked all night long and when my transformer got the light of the day, it shut off well too. I needed this because I ran out of wire, so this extra makes me able to finalize my setup. I have had no issues so far, and it fits in my connectors just fine. My lights at the end of my strand are just as bright as the ones at the beginning. I like it. It works for me!

        "Low voltage landscape lighting<<<Low voltage outdoor rated direct bury wire|||B07Q5JXYCP ★★★★☆ [2022-01-13] <b>Wire is 5 stars, connectors get 3 stars.</b> There's not much to say about the wire other than it is your typical low voltage, outdoor rated, direct bury 14 gauge stranded copper wire. It is solid copper, and not plated like you'll get with lower priced wire. The price is at least 25% less than what you'll pay in a big box store. The connectors don't come with instructions although they are somewhat intuitive to install. Installation goes much easier if you attach the connector to the 14 gauge wire first by separating about 3\" of the two 14 gauge vconductors. Then unscrewing the larger size cap end of the connector. Underneath the cap you'll see a long metal pin. The pin will pierce the insulation of the wire when you screw the cap back on the connector. Once you have it attached to the 14 gauge wire unscrew the cap on the other end of the connector. This cap will have a small hole in which you insert the stripped end of whatever wire is coming from the light fixture you're trying to attach. Make sure you strip about a half an inch of insulation off that wire. I inserted this wire through the hole of the cap and then into the open end of the connector. They'll be a small metal rod sticking up and you want to press the wire in as far as it'll go and then screw the cap back on. If all went well the pressure of the cap will hold the wire inside the connector. I'm not sure about the weather resistance of the metal used inside this connector so I used some electrical corrosion prevention paste, which is a dark gray silicon based gel that is sold to help weatherproof outdoor electrical connections or when you're dealing with aluminum wiring. Hopefully the paste will make the connection more weather resistant. So far they've been out in the yard for a few months and I haven't had any issues.",

It features two stranded copper conductors and PVC insulation. SPT-2 Lamp Cord is water-resistant, sunlight-resistant, and can withstand severe environmental conditions.

This wire looks like the usual zip cord, it is flexible, the insulation is fairly thick, and resistance measurement shows it to be consistent with 18 awg stranded copper wire. Barring rodent attacks, it should stand up well. It would also be fine for speaker wiring and, because It is actually rated for 300V, you can use as 110V lamp cord. However, be careful to stay within the current rating, which might make it chancy for many appliances. The description says that it is tinned copper; that’s obviously not true but also irrelevant. The price/foot is quite low reasonable so I’d recommend it.",

        "Garden lighting projects<<<Can carry about ten amps|||B0CH2R3XNH ★★★★☆ [2023-11-18] <b>Copper Clad * ALUMINUM * for maybe 10 amps</b> This product sort of tricked me. I saw 12/2 wire and I’m just so used to everything being copper that I didn’t notice this listing is for CCA (Copper Clad Aluminum). That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but if - like me - you see 12 AWG and have a knee jerk expectation this can carry twenty amps then you’re going to be disappointed. That said, you don’t normally need that kind of amperage in a low voltage system anyway. What tipped me off was measuring the resistance. When I join the two ends of this roll to get a 240-ft loop, I measure 1.0 ohms (after subtracting out 0.1 for my test leads). That’s about double what I’d expect from 12 AWG copper, and puts it more in the neighborhood of 16 AWG copper. So we’re looking at wire here that can carry something in the neighborhood of ten amps — assuming you have enough voltage to even make that happen. This is a consideration that I don’t see mentioned in the product listing at the time of this writing. And that’s probably fine for most garden lighting projects (up to maybe 100W, hopefully not all going down one wire). LED lights these days really don’t use a whole lot of power. So if this product meets your needs then by all means go for it. I see nothing to complain about in terms of build quality and fully expect it to survive direct burial operation. I just want to make sure you’re not under-sizing your wire. And, just to be clear, this wire is for low voltage applications. If you’re looking to carry line voltage without running conduit then you probably want UF-B wire instead and there are rules about how deep you have to bury it (usually one foot at the very least — and that’s assuming you have ground fault protection)."

When it comes to outdoor, 12v landscape lights, you need to properly size the cable for the circuit.

This is solid copper (the good stuff) 16 gauge cable, so it can handle up to 13 amps (which is about 1,500 watts!) but voltage does drop over distance. So this could easily handle one of the outdoor lighting kits or if you just want to add some more lights.

It is rated for up to 600V but I'm only using 24 volts. The wiring gauge is 16 gauge. For my indoor LED application, this is a thicker gauge than I need. The main downside is that the cable is about 1/2\" in diameter. That is a bit thick for some places I have to run it. The wire can be bent around a very tight turn radius without breaking or damaging some of the strands. The wire comes with some zip ties, heat shrink tubs and band to keep the wire from unspooling. This wire does work out well for some application. It would work great with outdoor landscape lighting if need 6 separate conductors.

This wire looks like your typical lamp cord/zip wire, but at 12 gauge, this is pretty stout wire. Like zip wire, the two conductors are insulated in black flexible rubber insulation and joined by a thin section of rubber in the middle, so you can easily split the two conductors apart for making any necessary connections. And like typical zip wire, one of the conductors is identified by ribbing on the exterior of the insulation; this conductor is used, by convention, as the neutral wire. I've learned the hard way that before you put any wire into service, check it for breaks. Both conductors in this 100 foot spool passed the continuity test. What else is there to like? They include a chart (see photo) that shows the maximum wattage for any given length and gauge of wire, so it's nice to have that as a handy reference. It's also ETL listed (sort of like UL listed). For low voltage applications like landscape lighting, you could argue that being ETL listed is overkill, but it's a nice thing to have regardless since it is rated for up to 300 volts. One minor nit--I wish that they had length markings on the wire like some wires do--once you start using this, it's nice to be able to know how much length is remaining without having to unspool it and find it's not enough.

When it comes to outdoor, 12v landscape lights, you need to properly size the cable for the circuit.

This is solid copper (the good stuff) 16 gauge cable, so it can handle up to 13 amps (which is about 1,500 watts!) but voltage does drop over distance.

Even if thats all you need, what a waste of shipping 100' / 200' / 300' would be way more acceptable. The wire coating is nice, a bit soft for most of my applications, I generally prefer a stiffer more abrasion resistant wire, but the temp rating makes up for that. The included spools are nice, but opening is too small to fit my wire spool rack. Overall this size and length would be great for use in wiring aux lights, or running from a fuse panel to an accessory within the inside of a vehicle."

Unlike some low voltage landscape lighting cables, this does not look appropriate for direct burial. There are however, 2 layers of insulation to the cable: color coded (red and black) insulators on each conductor and a thicker protective insulator on the exterior. The wire gauge is quite light at #18, so it is especially good for LED lights which don't draw much current. I would also feel comfortable using it on a single halogen fixture at 20 watts or less. Overall the thin profile of the cable lends itself to being able to tuck it away easily and out of sight. I will likely be using it under a deck to power LV light fixtures."

Connect the blue to the working wire and then one green to that working zone and the other green to a nonworking zone due to cut wire. Simple as it gets, solved my issue perfectly.

        "Alternative to digging up yard<<<Fixes damaged wire issues without digging|||B07FYWHM3L ★★★★★ [2022-04-25] <b>Field Wire Bad? This is the no-dig answer.</b> Simple instructions. Simple installation. If you can twist wire nuts then you can install this. I had a valve stop working. I replaced the solenoid and the internal components and still nothing. The valve worked manually with the bleed valve and by twisting the solenoid but I could not get it to activate with the controller. I moved the wire from the closest zone and jumped it to the non-working valve's solenoid and the valve worked no problem. All of my testing indicated no power to the field wire. It was not in a location where I could run a new wire (under a large section of driveway + sidewalk + retaining wall). I had this installed and was testing the system and covering up holes within an hour of arrival. It does exactly what it says it does which is much better than every politician.",

Amazing product - works as advertised even though I have no idea how.</b> This is an amazing product that solves several problems. NOTE: I did not purchase myself but a company I hired to fix my irrigation used it and WOW, it works! For my situation we needed to a) add 2 new zones to my system while also b) fixing a zone that had a damaged wire somewhere, most likely under some concrete. The irrigation company used these little gadgets to prevent having to dig all the way back to the pump/controller in the garage. I bet this saved them HOURS of digging and rewiring. What a miracle item this is! One VERY MINOR gripe - the wire gauge used on these is much thinner than the rest of the wires in my system. This in no way affects how it works, but would be nice if they were a thicker gauge."

        "Burying under gates<<<Very sturdy and rigid|||B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ [2024-01-31] <b>Works great for farm use</b> The RiteFENCE Electric Fence Double Insulated Underground Hard Cable is working perfectly for use 'underneath' my 12' and 16' foot double gates that lead to my pasture. For years I have used a system where I disconnect my electric fence by hand to open my gates without getting shocked. I dug a small trench about 6\" deep under a couple of my gates and buried the RiteFENCE, and left each end protrude out of the ground about two feet to connect to one of the lower existing fence wires so as not to disconnect the continuous circuit at any time when opening gates now. I chose the 6\" depth to bury the heavily insulated RiteFENCE since in addition to moving livestock through the gates, I also drive vehicles and farm implements through the gates as well. The RiteFENCE is very sturdy and rigid, and the 12-½ gauge took some time to straighten out to fit flat and neatly into the trenches I dug and placed the wire into, but this is a definite plus for electric fence wire to be used on a farm or ranch. The RiteFENCE doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and has a thick outer coating with the inner wire apparently coated as well for the 'double insulation' aspect. When installing, I also cut back a couple of inches of the RiteFENCE on each end and used a heavy duty crimp connection to the barb wire fencing I use. Once crimped, I neatly wrapped the connections with quality electrical tape to seal from the elements. The RiteFENCE is going to be ideal for many other underground connection needs I have around the farm. I would highly recommend any farmers and ranchers who run electric fence to give the RiteFENCE a try if you want to eliminate the risk of a nasty shock, especially with the higher powered fence chargers. The price point seems very fair and in fact is actually a little cheaper than what I saw at my local farm supply store. Highly recommend!"

I'd have no concern burying this in rocky soil. The reel comes with clear plastic wrap to hold the wire snug.

It doesn't 'hold' a shape well at all it's just so flexible. The high temp insulation makes it nice for soldering, it doesn't shrink off or split out from the heat of nearby soldering - and the temp range is also low (cold). I didn't test it, but the low end spec is -76F.. (So obviously I'd have something special around to make any claim about testing it anywhere near that.) I'll have to pickup a couple new rolls for my next trip to Antarctica (lol). It's a whole bunch heavier at 10 gauge than I normally use but I have a couple projects that will use up most of, if not all of the rolls. I'm adding fog lights to my car and I'm rewiring a couple speakers. It feels so nice that if I have any left, I may just rig up a new set of test leads for my multi-meter. Also available in smaller gauges, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 & 22, those other sizes are probably more commonly used and more in line with the size I'd usually pickup for small general purpose projects - but the fog lights, can draw a bunch of current, so for a 10 ft run in a car, this can handle >200 watts, or plenty enough for my fog lights.",

It is a sturdy construction aid, and a close rendition of the name brand that it tries to duplicate. Most everyone that works with electrical wiring has had to build a wire dispenser out of 2 x 4’s and such. This is definitely a better option, except when it comes time to snap them together and put them into the back of your truck or van! The instructions are well laid out and explain all kinds of uses. They also instruct you on how to snap this together for storing or to make a seat. Problem is, they don’t snap. They slide into place and then unslide as soon as they bounce around a bit driving down the road, or if you try to pick them up. They also come with alignment pins to make a 36” high work bench. The indents for storing the pins are so loose that I had to wrap them in a baggie so they would be tight enough to stay stowed away. If you don’t keep those pins with the dispenser, you won’t have them if you need a taller work bench. Overall I rated these a 3 star because two of the important features have a huge shortcoming. I prefer that my tools perform as advertised. I don’t recommend this item because for $25 more, you can get the original version that will probably last a lifetime, or longer.",

        "Sitting on as a stool<<<Can hold 330 lbs when used as directed|||B0CL4QNJKB ★★★☆☆ [2024-01-08] <b>Half Finished</b> The plastic seems robust and strong with a claimed load carrying capacity of 330 lbs when used as directed for holding spools of wire or sitting on it as a stool. Regarding directions, they are excellent. Written in clear, concise, and informative American English. The way the two halves nest together for carrying and each stand have carrying hands on 3 sides makes carrying them convenient. Unfortunately, while they got lots right, the product feels half baked; while it can be very useful now, hopefully the next version will correct some of the following shortcomings. The location on the rack for storing the stand stacking pins does NOT work, because the channel where they go is wider than the pins' diameter, so they just fall out. In other words, there is no mechanical catch or other device to hold the pins in their storage location. This problem could have been easily fixed with four small 3/8 to ½ inch button magnet, one pair at each end of the two storage channels. A quick search shows that four rare earth magnets would add only slightly more than 1 cent ($0.0125) to the materials cost of the product. My other initial concern is will the ¾ to 1 inch conduit or rigid pipe they recommend for suspending spools of wire between the supports stay in place if the wire is pulled off the spools at an angle toward either support vs perpendicular to the support pipe and parallel to the supports or will the pipe slip out of the hole in the stand.",

Normally my spools just sit on the shelf but now I can stay better organized and spool the length of wire out that I need easier. I was a little surprised at just how durable this stand is.

I'm assuming they were in that. Again, I don't expect to put it in table mode so not a big loss. The next thing affects me a little more. There are four rubber feet on each end, 8 in total. These are to keep it level and provide some cushioning. As received, mine has 5 of these rubber feet, missing 3 of them. To have the thing level, I’ll have to remove the remaining feet. The entire package is the two plastic pieces zip tied together, with the plastic bag taped to the side. The only packaging on top of that is a thin piece of cardboard printed with the logo and instructions sandwiched in to hold it. There is no protection for the feet, which are only glued on and can easily fall off. There is no protection for the plastic bag which is very likely to rip and have lost pieces before it gets to you. Personally, I'm still satisfied overall with this device.

I'm assuming they were in that. Again, I don't expect to put it in table mode so not a big loss. The next thing affects me a little more. There are four rubber feet on each end, 8 in total. These are to keep it level and provide some cushioning. As received, mine has 5 of these rubber feet, missing 3 of them. To have the thing level, I’ll have to remove the remaining feet. The entire package is the two plastic pieces zip tied together, with the plastic bag taped to the side. The only packaging on top of that is a thin piece of cardboard printed with the logo and instructions sandwiched in to hold it. There is no protection for the feet, which are only glued on and can easily fall off. There is no protection for the plastic bag which is very likely to rip and have lost pieces before it gets to you. Personally, I'm still satisfied overall with this device. I'll just be going to the hardware store to find some rubber furniture feet for it myself."

        "as a table or seat<<<flimsy when used as a taller table|||B0CL4QNJKB ★★★★★ [2024-01-07] <b>Great to have for spools, but some QC issues,</b> This is a really heavy duty, easy to transport spool holder/feeder. I love the versatility of being able to hold multiple spools on EMT using these. Using it to cut pipe with the V notches on top works well enough. Using it as a table or seat is kind of far fetched, but you could if you really wanted to. It came with two pins so you could put the two ends top edge to edge to make some kind of taller table....though it's a bit flimsy so don't bump it. Supposedly there are two spots to secure the pins, but the spot indicated doesn't hold the included pins at all. Also, it has four rubber feet on each of the ends. One of mine was missing and another rubber foot had shifted to a different spot on the bottom. I got this to be a wire spool feeder, and for that it is very well suited and capable. The other touted capabilities are fluff to me, but may be useful to others."

It is flexy and easy to work with. It doesn't tangle/bulge internally and it coils sensibly. My wire gauge confirms it's 22awg. I plan to use this in my hobby of LED lighting controllers where this works well to send data, ground, and +VDC (5, 12, 24) to the strands from each transformer. I was pleased at the way this is packaged. Instead of being on a spool that explodes with released tension when uncoiled, this is on a larger plastic spool that's easy to \"tie off\" for reuse and very closely matches (coincidence?) the spools that LEDs come on, allowing them to live harmoniously in a box or standing on end in a file cabinet. The sheath strips nicely. The wires tin well. The cable doesn't sproing into a garage door spring at pressure when released from the package to use. It's a good price. If you need wire at the specifications listed, it's hard to go wrong here. While there are a number of variables involved, the required math is pretty straight-forward. 22G is about 43.4 ohms per km or 0.0434 ohms.per meter. Your project may not be running all channels at max brightness on all bulbs (RGB...and sometimes W) at the same time or it may be doing so for only a fraction of a second. Doing it for hours inside a packed conduit is different than an air-gapped conduit or being in the open. Just doing some quick math, let's imagine a 241 WS2812 project (like a Hexagon or a short strip) where each bulb is pulling .60ma per bulb (full intensity, white, and eye-torching white ON) That's a 14.5 W fixture at 24V, so you can use 22 gauge wire like this to drive 283feet and still lose only 1VDC at 24V. (It's worse at low voltages - this is why you want high voltages if wire length matters. It's the reason the power company lines to you are at 10's of thousands of volts....) If you're just doing boosters into taps, I'd imagine the distance to be even longer. 22Gauge is a good tradeoff of \"easy to work with\" and \"enough copper to deliver your electrons without resistance\" (hahahhaa. Ohm's Law jokes never get old.) I also did a spot test on painting it and it seems to take paint acceptably well. Some of this spool is probably going to end up in a permanent fixture that's tucked/painted into a corner of mine. This cable seems to be everything it claims to be and a nice set of specs for consumer lighting. Not fusable strands. Not chunky/expensive solid copper. Recommended."

That part seems to work fine. I used this cable also to run pause and start buttons on an Arduino based system (5V), but it picks up interference when I run my spindle VFD. I get rapid and random pause and start. Lots of time spent troubleshooting. After running the cord around the other side of the bench a maximum distance from the VFD, things improved. It's not completely good, but I'm hoping some ferrite cores will finish it off. Don't expect this cable to have great shielding, and you may still run into problems if you have a source of high EMI.

I can run all 3 fans, thermistor, and 3 wire LEDs in this one cable with all their individual wires hooked up.

        "Lighting circuits<<<14 AWG (14/2)|||B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★☆ [2023-06-05] <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again)."

That meant 4 wires bound together for line, 6 for neutral, 6 for ground. Using these made that process easy and clean. I also used the Wago 221-412 lever nuts connecting the pigtails to the switches. Since each switch needed 4 connectors, the small Wagos made it very easy! As always, do things meticulously when doing wiring! Always visually ensure the all wires are inserted fully into each connector. After you push each connector bunch into the box, validate all wires are still fully inserted and on the 221s, ensure the levers are shut. Love these!"

Be sure you know what you're buying. This is ultra flexible, with many super-fine strands and silicone rubber insulation marked 200C (higher than PVC but lower than PTFE). The fine strands (150 of them, but I didn't count!) can be a bit of a challenge when crimping contacts... make sure no microscopic strands escape the crimp -- then it works great. The insulation is thick but soft: very easy to work with but also easily damaged if used in the wrong application. It's the right cable for routing in tight locations, since it's so willing to bend and lay flat... good for DIY drones (flexing arms or retracting legs) or making wiring harnesses that need to flex but are well protected from abrasion and pinching. For more rugged high-temp insulation, consider PTFE but it is much more difficult to work with and hard to find at a reasonable price. As noted by others, some colors are a bit off. Red is clearly orange, and blue is gray-purple. That's okay for my purposes, but maybe not if you are building to a print for assemblies that will be inspected. The velcro wraps keep each spool neat, and the box is good for organizing these spools when lots of other wire spools are around."

        "RC planes primary power<<<Tinned copper|||B0CRYX1P5T ★★★★★ [2024-04-22] <b>Exactly as Represented</b> The Alienhomy 12 Gauge Wire 2 Conductor Silicone Wire (25ft Black/Red) is a very nice spool of wire. I've been using very similar wire, and will be using this wire, for primary power on my larger RC planes. The tinning and fine stranding make it easy to solder into various connectors and the flexibility allows this relatively large conductor to be easily tucked away inside my models. The high temperature rating of the insulation ensures that it can handle the heavy, usually short-term amperages that today's advanced RC battery and motor technology demand. I also like to use this wire for various other hobby projects where flexibility is required for making or breaking plug-in connections. It can withstand a lot of flexing due to both the fine stranding and the thick. but soft. silicone insulation. The wire is marked at regular intervals with conductor size and insulation temperature ratings. It is not listed, nor is it appropriate for building wiring. I can recommend this product with confidence."

This makes it stiffer, easier to route, and tougher. I wouldn't hesitate to walk on this wire or pull it across metal edges that would cut silicon insulation. The larger strands are also better for crimping since smaller strands are more likely to break at the crimp.

Even veteran contractors often do not know this product exists and it is a lifesaver. Due to the increase in use of Wi-Fi thermostats, which require a common, more people are using similar products. This is because Wi-Fi thermostats require a common . If a common ids required, you must have a minimum of five wires and many homes were wired with four wires if they had single stage heat abd mercury thermostats. This is a common issue with older hones. Another issue is that Low-voltage wiring is very fine and it is hard copper, not stranded. So, age can allow for deterioration and breakage causing problems. Since thermostat wires can be very difficult to pull, depending on if the wire is nailed inside the trusses, inside the walls, in a multi level home or condo, this product can also provide a replacement for a broken wire for a standard stat. This inexpensive product allows us to forgo running a new thermostat wire, at several hundred dollars expense to the customer. We can provide a replacement wire for a daily wine when pulling a new wire is difficult or cost prohibitive, or provide the common needed when needed for a wifi stat when only 4 wires exist.

The new thermostat needed the additional wire for the \"C-wire\" to properly power the thermostat because it's a smart thermostat. Before you start make sure you need 6 strands, some may need more or less. You may not need a new wire. The install was pretty simple but could be wildly different for you depending on how it's wired. For me, I just cute the old wire at the thermostat, taped the new wire to it overlapping about 6 inches and then went to the basement to pull the old wire bringing the new one through. Since all the holes mine went through were good size it went through no problem. Since it's such a small wire (compared to electrical), hopefully yours is, too. You'll need some basic wire cutters and trimmers. If you've never done this before it's pretty easy but you should probably watch a YouTube video and practice on an end of the wire you can cut off. Don't want to expose any of the copper wire and cause a short. The wires are all the same regardless of color, that's for your benefit to differentiate them at the thermostat and furnace ends. Make sure you're very meticulous about this. Be sure to power down your furnace before starting there. Check YouTube for guides. In the process I blew a fuse on my furnace and got the blinking light, 5 times. I'm not sure what I did that caused that (probably use error this project was a first for me), but the fuse was near the wire inputs.

The exterior coating is thick and it has an additional plastic layer + a plastic separator. It’s “exterior” for about 3” of wire on this run but I’m also going to run it direct-burial to my generator and I have confidence it will hold up. It fit standard Cat6 ends (barely). Standard tension guards also fit on the wire but once again, barely. My gripe is that there are defects on the individual wire sheathing (mostly green stripe). It’s bubbled and extra thick in places so if you accidentally find a piece like that, you lose 1 inch to 1 foot recutting the wire until you find an inch or two that will push into the connector. I can’t find this wire in black locally so I’m not complaining too much but be aware it’s frustrating and probably not what you want for your 10Gbps network.

Looked at and tried many types and they were never flexible enough to give me the comfort that they wouldn't bind or have the wires break inside. This stuff flexes so well that it can be routed easily and definitely will clean up the wiring, it even maintains it's path and doesn't flop to the side so it won't need anything more than a strand of filament to keep it inline and away from motion parts. I can run all 3 fans, thermistor, and 3 wire LEDs in this one cable with all their individual wires hooked up. If you run even a cheap breakout toolhead and deck pcb with a common ground you can add in the 5 BL probe wires into it and only have your servo cable and heater wires separate in the sleeving, which they should be anyways due to size/current differences. All this in a 6mm or so package. I did tidy wiring before but could never get all the wires to less than 11-12mm and they were always lumpy and didn't flex well binding up my toolhead on certain movements. This will help me get it down to less than 10mm diameter in total. If i upgrade to a board system i'll definitely come back to see if there's a cable with the proper number i need to keep all the low voltage in one. Only thing that would make this perfect is to have multi gauges in it but that's custom cabling and i don't need 50,000 ft of it."

        "Power over Ethernet (PoE) devices<<<Higher DC resistance|||B07GH7JHG9 ★☆☆☆☆ [2021-04-09] <b>Beware of Copper Clad Aluminum Wire!</b> When shopping for Cat5e or Cat6 network cables, make sure you are comparing apples to apples. One of the most common tactics of the “low cost leaders” is to use aluminum instead of copper wire. This can lead to network issues from using inferior materials to transmit the signal. Looking to cut costs, manufacturers started using aluminum wire dipped in a thin coating of copper. This technique created an aluminum core cable surrounded by a thin layer of copper. The performance and safety of CCA cables are radically different. In fact, aluminum network cables violate TIA and IEC standards for Cat5e and Cat6 cables. CCA cable has higher attenuation than pure copper cables. This results in a greater loss of data, as packets have to be re-transmitted. The more data that is re-transmitted, the slower your network performs. Plus, these problems are compounded by every foot of cable you use; the longer the cable, the worse the performance. CCA cables also have a 55% higher DC resistance. This increases the amount of energy that is transferred into heat and reduces the amount of power that can be transferred. This issue makes them unusable for power over Ethernet (PoE) devices like IP cameras and phones. These cut corners also affect installers because aluminum wire creates installation issues. Due to the lower tensile strength, aluminum cables can be damaged when being pulled. Single conductors can break, making the cable useless, or the whole cable can snap. Aluminum also has a lower bend radius than pure copper cables. This means you can’t bend it as much before it fails. In short, spend the extra money on solid core copper cable."

Setup: I had some dimmable LED can lights I wanted to use for an under counter lighting project. I'd tried LED strip lights and they simply weren't bright enough for my or my wife's taste. Thus, I disassembled some dimmable LED can lights, pulled out their guts and mounted underneath my counter. I ran this wire in between the cabinets and tied them all together and soldered my connection on the top. I brought the wiring into an outlet and tied it all together with a smart Alexa plug in socket and a in line dimmer. As you can see from the pictures, it turned out great. Wiring seems to be of a very solid quality. Soldered nicely and hid nicely for my use. I highly recommend this wire and will order again for other DIY projects at home."

Initially I was looking at two separate wires soldered and ran together, but after locating this wire I decided to give it a shot. I liked that both wires are encased in the insulation, it made it much easier to run and secure than two different wires. Perfect size for running into the end caps of the aluminum channel for my lights. The only real negative I can see is that getting it out of the insulation to solder both wires was a little challenging. Not terrible - but you need to be careful when stripping it so as not to compromise the two wires inside."

The main downside is that the cable is about 1/2\" in diameter. That is a bit thick for some places I have to run it. The wire can be bent around a very tight turn radius without breaking or damaging some of the strands. The wire comes with some zip ties, heat shrink tubs and band to keep the wire from unspooling. This wire does work out well for some application. It would work great with outdoor landscape lighting if need 6 separate conductors.

Luckily, a variety of providers have arisen over the past few years. Here we have one where most of the work has been done for you, with the AC plug already connected. Now there's no question that this is a contemporary AC plug, and if you're doing a genuine restoration, you probably won't go this route, but there's also no question that this is a safe approach and one that is probably going to be hidden by furniture anyway. In this case, the fabric wrap covers two independently insulated wires, already stripped and soldered and ready to be wired directly into your device, lamp, appliance, etc. The fabric has a nice sheen and looks great; I picked the brown color to go with a copper lamp - works perfectly.",

The roll didn't come with the inner end sticking out so I unrolled it all, drilled a larger hole so it would fit, then re-wrappped (poorly). The inner end could be connected to a power source to allow re-using the roll for temporary tasks needing power at a distance. I measured 3.4mm dia. insulation, 1.4mm dia. wire. Resistance over the whole roll (100 ft. x both directions) was 0.864 ohms, which works out to 4.32 ohms per 1000 ft (verified with LCR meter and running 2A current through it). Matches expected for 16-gauge copper stranded wire. I had to unroll all the wire to get at the other end as they don't poke it through the hole on the side of the spool."

The 20-year old valves and connectors were way past due. Upon digging up the old connectors the old ones were old school non-protected simple wire connectors. However , these new ones were slightly too big—my fault for not double-checking gauge size. These are too big for small gauge wires. Even connecting six 14 gauge wires will be too big unless you twist the wires around each other to increase size. That’s exactly what I did to create greater copper wire circumference, and after figuring that out (wasting one nut) they work flawlessly. High quality product, should last under ground for 20 years, but again, check your gauge size."

If it gets plugged up? Your floor will get wet, door speakers get damp and damaged if it goes unaddressed. THIS is the correct wire to unplug those drains! Its smooth, sturdy enough to push through without buckling, and you can save the loop to reuse at another time. The price is right, and there's 100' to use for other stuff. 12gauge galvanized steel. I tried 2 other wire typed and just ended up shredding the skin off my thumb pad struggling with no success. This is the stuff. Use a pliers to push it inch by inch if necessary.

I am using it to run wiring in my motorhome for a water control valve I am installing so that I can control the flow of water into the fresh water storage tank by flipping a switch. This cable uses copper conductors and has a PVC outer jacket. It is not as flexible as some other cables, but that is not an issue for what I am doing, and it is not suitable for wet environments. Nonetheless, the outer jacket is rugged and the 16 gauge wires are capable of carrying 11 amps. It is perfect for the type of circuit I am running, which is 12V and requires little current. This cable would work well for many 12V or other low voltage applications."

The wire had such a voltage drop at 30 feet, it wouldn't even start my compressor and at that distance my spot light was appx. half as bright. I even soldered the connections so I know that couldn't have caused the problem. A 16 gauge wire should carry the full load that far without a problem...Now, I have to purchase more wire, but it definitely won't be this brand. BTW, the seperate 12 volt adapter plug that came with the compressor is only 18 gauge so I figured the 16 gauge wire would easily handle the load."

For years I have used a system where I disconnect my electric fence by hand to open my gates without getting shocked. I dug a small trench about 6\" deep under a couple of my gates and buried the RiteFENCE, and left each end protrude out of the ground about two feet to connect to one of the lower existing fence wires so as not to disconnect the continuous circuit at any time when opening gates now. I chose the 6\" depth to bury the heavily insulated RiteFENCE since in addition to moving livestock through the gates, I also drive vehicles and farm implements through the gates as well. The RiteFENCE is very sturdy and rigid, and the 12-½ gauge took some time to straighten out to fit flat and neatly into the trenches I dug and placed the wire into, but this is a definite plus for electric fence wire to be used on a farm or ranch. The RiteFENCE doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and has a thick outer coating with the inner wire apparently coated as well for the 'double insulation' aspect. When installing, I also cut back a couple of inches of the RiteFENCE on each end and used a heavy duty crimp connection to the barb wire fencing I use. Once crimped, I neatly wrapped the connections with quality electrical tape to seal from the elements. The RiteFENCE is going to be ideal for many other underground connection needs I have around the farm. I would highly recommend any farmers and ranchers who run electric fence to give the RiteFENCE a try if you want to eliminate the risk of a nasty shock, especially with the higher powered fence chargers. The price point seems very fair and in fact is actually a little cheaper than what I saw at my local farm supply store. Highly recommend!",

A small family of raccoons can easily do $500-worth of damage in a single night, so it needs to be as protected as we can get it. The low-impedance charger is in the barn, with a lead wire taking the charge out to the fence. That would work OK without some of this wire - until we took the tractor or pickup out to pick some corn for the stand. For that, a drive-thru gate is needed. A buried wire/cable is the most practical way to build one of those, IF the wire is designed to be buried, as this one is.

I did my part as a female I contacted FS to make sure I was buying good sturdy poles with the recommended (By FS) insulators. After many weeks now FS does not care. Don’t waste time with FS. Money lost but will never lose anymore because fool me once you can’t fool me twice. Trashed this junk insulators, have no idea what to do with these poles, guess I’ll trash them. No one wants their fence to look wonky with poles lending sideways, foreard, backwards etc. I guess if you cement them in it might be ok. But where I needed them and what I need them for that was not an option. Over $100 plus might as well have thrown that money away cause I do not have any working products. Poles and insulators did not work for me like FS recommended. Contacted FS many times. FS passes the blame over to Amazon yet it was FS who told me what to buy prior to checking out."

Once I got the wipes stripped down, it was easy to twist these together and seal the wires. I tried them on both stranded and solid wires - and they worked very effectively. The wires need to twisted ver firmly, as you need to penetrate the first sealing grommet and if the wires are not twisted well, it was hard to get them past that first grommet/layer."

The lights are powered by a low voltage cable under the walkways. Last Winter a mother fox made a temporary den for her cubs under one of the boardwalks. In the Spring we discovered that several of the marker lights wouldn't light up due to power cables that were chewed through by sharp little teeth. The foxes have moved on but we were faced with repairing the broken cable. That's why I got this cable. It's perfect for low voltage outdoor use. The outside jacket is thick and robust. It took a bit of careful cutting to strip it off without damaging the inside conductor wires. Once off, I noticed this isn't just a standard single channel insulator jacket. It actually has two channels -- one for each of the conductors. (See photo.) That's makes for very tightly insulated conductors that should provide enhanced protection in underground or very wet environments. When I stripped the two conductors, I noticed they are not tinned as stated in the product description. This may or may not be an issue for you. Tinned copper cable is easier to solder and also minimizes corrosion for non-soldered joints. I removed a star from an otherwise five star review due to this. Summary Comments If you don't need tinned copper cable for low voltage outdoor applications, this is a good choice. The insulation is robust and should hold up well in underground or wet environments. You get pure copper conductors that provide efficient electrical conductivity."

A small family of raccoons can easily do $500-worth of damage in a single night, so it needs to be as protected as we can get it. The low-impedance charger is in the barn, with a lead wire taking the charge out to the fence. That would work OK without some of this wire - until we took the tractor or pickup out to pick some corn for the stand. For that, a drive-thru gate is needed. A buried wire/cable is the most practical way to build one of those, IF the wire is designed to be buried, as this one is. We won't need the fence for six months, so I haven't had a chance to actually use it yet. But, this looks to be much stronger and more durable, less prone to breakage from driving over it, than any gate wire we've used so far. An excellent value.",

        "Underwater applications<<<Potentially waterproof to 9 meters for a couple of hours|||B0CJ3Y1BNQ ★★★★★ [2024-01-22] <b>Decent waterproof coupler/connector</b> The description calls this a “connector”. The distinction is subtle but this is technically a coupler: it couples two cables. But it is also a connector because it connects the electrical conductors inside the cable. In any case, the connector should be considered a permanent connector, as much as anything is truly permanent. Because the various components are all screwed together, these connection and coupling processes can both be reversed, I can decouple the cable and disconnect the wires. This connector is, however, NOT a not quick disconnect device. It is not intended for frequent decoupling or even multiple disconnects and re-connects. The plastic seals will most likely lose their ability to seal properly, but it should support an occasional disconnect. My Intended Use: I plan to use these connectors on my fishing light cable to extend the depth from 15 ft to about 40 feet. I fish for kokanee in winter under the ice. They can be found anywhere from 10 ft deep to about 40 ft. My fishing light only comes with a 15 ft cable. So, it needs an extension. The connector to do this will need to be waterproof to about 30 ft (approx. 9 m) for a handful of hours at a time. In this use, I may need to occasionally reconnect things as fine tune it. For best security, I should probably use a new connector each time... I won’t be able to actually use this extended light until we have safe ice conditions. I will report back on my experience as soon as possible. IP68 Rating and Maximum Depth: What is the actual depth rating – and duration – for this connector? The IP68 rating only means that the device will remain waterproof essentially indefinitely, down to the depth specified by the manufacturer. [OK, here comes the really nerdy part of this reviewer...] One: According to the Product Description page, this connector has an IP68 rating down to a depth of 3 meters with an unstated but implied indefinite duration, technically not deep enough for my use. However, the PDF documents in the Product guides and documents section, give different specifications. Two: The “Technical Report” (see “Certificate of Analysis” link) states that the test specification for the IEC60528 standard for IPX8 lists the Test conditions for the IPX8 rating as 2 meters for 120 hrs. The test to verify this was performed at 2 meters, and passed. Three: In the “Attestation of Conformity” document attached to the “Safety Information” link, it says that the rated conditions were specified by the client as120 hours down to 4 meters. The test for this specification was performed at 4 meters, and also passed. Since one of these tests was performed at 4 meters, we can assume it is waterproof for up to 120 hours down to 4 meters. This is still less than my desired depth of 9 meters but since I will be using this connector for only a couple hours at a time, I think it will be OK. I will report back after I verify this on the ice. After connecting (and coupling) the fish light cable and my extension cable, I can say that the connection feels secure and looks to be waterproof. One should probably use appropriate ferrules on the ends of the wires to be screwed into the connector, but I tinned mine with solder. This means that I had to re-tighten the screws a couple of times before considering the connection permanent and closing it up. I like these connectors. They look secure and should be waterproof enough for my needs. My only complaint for them is the lack of information on assembly. Specifically, I would like to know how TIGHTLY to twist the parts together. They need to be tight enough so the seals become and remain waterproof, yet not so tight that the plastic parts split open in the long term. Despite that I still give thee connectors a 5 star rating. (At least, down to 30 feet... :)"

If you need all 10 pairs this is something that might concern you, but since I only need 2 male assemblies and 6 female assemblies, I can just pick the best of the bunch. They all passed a continuity test. Wire color between connectors lined up--red to red and black to black--nothing mismatched like I've seen complaints about in reviews for other, similar products on Amazon. Wire ends came tinned, too. Connectors have a nice, positive connection that is tight enough to hold but not too difficult to separate when needed.

However the additional expense of terminal-blocks makes the price higher (almost doubled my 9 channel setup costs). For me this was more than I was willing to spend, so I returned the item (Thank you Amazon). Also I had a difficult time finding a sound quality test review and at this time-I didn't see anyone adding layers to increase the gauge for larger speakers or improved cable quality. Last I was a bit uncertain if overlaps for full 9 channel runs would or would not cause any issues with my 9 speaker channels of connectivity along with the additional challenge of awkward wiring at the amplifier end. Maybe if some terminal-blocks are included, and better less awkward terminal-blocks are developed, and more high-end review shows sonic benegits, than I'd love to consider these in the future."

This wire is 16 gauge but it's sheathing is thin so it is limited to low voltage applications. The wires are copper and that's a good thing but this is not rated for burial so it cannot be outdoors. Here are, however, a few things you can do with this wire. Use as TV and audio speaker wire Battery Charging Connect Thermostats and HVAC Run Security and Fire Alarm Systems Connect Doorbells -------------------------------------------- Now you know Cheers",

A small family of raccoons can easily do $500-worth of damage in a single night, so it needs to be as protected as we can get it. The low-impedance charger is in the barn, with a lead wire taking the charge out to the fence. That would work OK without some of this wire - until we took the tractor or pickup out to pick some corn for the stand. For that, a drive-thru gate is needed. A buried wire/cable is the most practical way to build one of those, IF the wire is designed to be buried, as this one is. We won't need the fence for six months, so I haven't had a chance to actually use it yet. But, this looks to be much stronger and more durable, less prone to breakage from driving over it, than any gate wire we've used so far. An excellent value."

Whether it's for work projects or just organizing the garage, this wire spool rack has been incredibly helpful. It can hold spools up to 34\" in diameter, which covers pretty much all the sizes I use. The load capacity of 330 lbs is more than enough for my needs, ensuring that even the heaviest spools are supported without any issue. The color black gives it a sleek look, which is a nice bonus, making it blend in well with my other tools and equipment. Setting it up was a breeze, and it's made accessing and storing my cables so much easier. No more tangled messes or spools rolling around on the floor! For anyone who's into DIY projects, works in trades, or just needs a better way to organize large spools of cable, this wire dispenser is a game-changer. It's sturdy, reliable, and has made my life a lot easier. Definitely one of the best practical investments I've made in a while.",

Reasonably easy to separate the wires by hand once you start it with a cut down the middle. Cut clean and stripped easily without losing any strands on the 10 gauge.

The prices for these spools are cheaper than similar PVC coated wires at Walmart for 20 gauge wire and these have more expensive silicone coating and tinned copper. Price wise these are very good wires and good for small projects or repairs on electronics. The wire is very flexible and good for replacing cheaper wires in outdoor equipment that are subject to the elements or chemicals. The silicone is good for almost degrees 400F which is great for power and heating equipment as they are more chemical resistant and won't melt as easily. I have two outdoor portable water heaters used for camping and the wiring on the units use the cheaper PVC and the insulation can melt when the heaters are used for extended periods. I have had to wrap the wires in aluminum heat wrap to protect the PVC cables now I can repair them with the silicone wires without having to wrap them with protective aluminum heat shields."

It is a sturdy construction aid, and a close rendition of the name brand that it tries to duplicate. Most everyone that works with electrical wiring has had to build a wire dispenser out of 2 x 4’s and such. This is definitely a better option, except when it comes time to snap them together and put them into the back of your truck or van! The instructions are well laid out and explain all kinds of uses. They also instruct you on how to snap this together for storing or to make a seat. Problem is, they don’t snap. They slide into place and then unslide as soon as they bounce around a bit driving down the road, or if you try to pick them up. They also come with alignment pins to make a 36” high work bench. The indents for storing the pins are so loose that I had to wrap them in a baggie so they would be tight enough to stay stowed away. If you don’t keep those pins with the dispenser, you won’t have them if you need a taller work bench. Overall I rated these a 3 star because two of the important features have a huge shortcoming. I prefer that my tools perform as advertised. I don’t recommend this item because for $25 more, you can get the original version that will probably last a lifetime, or longer."

No problem using it anywhere from 12 volt to 72 volts as long as amperage is kept within the recommended limits. One small note, unless you are really good with a sharp knife the thick outer covering is best cut and removed with a special tool. Just use a search term like \"round cable stripper\" and you'll find a variety of appropriate tools. Find a tool that matches the diameter(s) of the various multi-core cables you intend to be using. Over time I have actually ordered two styles of cable strippers, one for small diameters and another for diameters all the way up to an inch or more.

U can tell the immediate difference in the flexibility of the sheathing. Like comparing thick racing engine plug wire to the cheap thin stuff. As for any soldering - stuffs great thou higher bond point u can tell its stronger. Any splices r handled with some new solder joint connectors I just happened to snatch up and this stuff worked great in those too. I did find that there is the slight possiblity of tearing open the silicone jacket of this stuff 'easier' over other types due to having easier stripping ability so yankin' on this stuff when routing any wire runs needs to b given some added care to avoid snags on anything sharp.

However, it's good to have some thicker wire around for those times you have to move a lot of current, so I ordered the 18-gauge silicone wire. As for the wire itself, it seems high quality, with decent insulation. It's pre-tinned, which supposedly makes it easier to solder, though I didn't notice a huge difference (see video). It's nice that it comes with some heat-shrink in the same colors, for those times when you can't hide your wires from view. It even comes with colored zip ties, though I see less of a use for these. On the downside, the spools aren't that full; it's only 10 ft of wire, which frankly isn't that much. It'd be much more useful if they filled the spools. Like other wire assortments, the box this comes in doubles as a dispenser. However, it's kind of a disaster. Instead of aligning the spools vertically side by side, they lay the spools flat, with the wires coming out both sides. It's a little hard to explain the geometry of it all, but the spools get jumbled up much more easily, the box doesn't stay closed as firmly, and it's a pain to respool the wire if you've accidentally pulled out too much. There's a reason practically every wire assortment puts the spools side-by-side; it just plain works better. So while this is fine wire, i'd really recommend looking for a kit with a decent dispenser and more than 10ft per spool."

Wire did not run-back much (melting insulation while soldering is called run-back). As best as can be expected for non - Teflon wire. Good, non-fraying insulation strips well with a clean AWG labeled wire stripper. I got 30 AWG, so it is thin, but great for getting into the smaller thru-holes on my PCB. Also good for getting into the non-component thru-hole (vias) for temporary test points on PCBs. Don't get confused by the images - the wire gauge measurement circle is NOT included. I will certainly buy more of this when I need it. ThankS! : )"

The wire comes with small zip ties, a “toy” wire stripper, and heat shrink. I didn’t need any of those items. However, the wire itself is of good quality. The insulation is, shall we say, sturdy. A good, professional wire stripper is needed to bare the wires. The conductors are all individually tinned, and the wire is fairly flexible. The six different colors will help me to keep things straight when wiring between the six circuit boards on my project. Very happy with the wire.

Best use is for hanging fixtures as the wires are encased in a non stretching hard rubber sheathing that can be clamped at the top of the fixture to prevent the wires from pulling out at the top from the fixture's weight. This inner rubber sheathing is a non-kink material and with just the right amount of flexibility for a nice straight hanging appearance, and is also very strong. I would not suggest this for wiring of table lamps and such because it's too thick (about 5/16\") and inflexible for that purpose; proper rayon lamp cord would be better for that use. A piece of advice: put a small amount of crazy glue on the cloth covering where you plan to terminate it when cutting, stripping, etc. It tends to fray and ride up the rubber core when being handled and can't be pulled back down; the glue keeps it in place and prevents fraying.

        "Running through attic<<<18 gauge wire|||B01KWBPC7M ★★★★★ [2020-06-04] <b>Very decent wire. In depth review & Pics</b> Running some permanent LED strips in the living room vaulted ceiling. Needed wire to run through the attic from the LED strips to a controller about 22 feet away. Wanted something heavier than the 22 gauge wire you find everywhere, and I wanted 100 foot spool Those two combinations limited what was out there. Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white). Even with my current strips, would have been nice to be able to upgrade without having to re-run wire. Oh well, happy anyway!"

I usually buy my lugs directly from sky high car audio, but I was in a bit of a money pinch so $10 for a pack of 10 didn’t seem that worth it at the time. I ended up coming across these bad boys, which happened to be the best deal around. 50 lugs for less than $40. Honestly I was pretty hyped. I ended up remember that car audio 1/0 is not standard 1/0 welding wire. It’s actually oversized 1/0…so right in between 1/0-2/0. I decided to go for the 2/0 lugs and purchased 50 of them. I tested it out on 1/0 sky high wire and it fit like a GLOVE. The 2/0 lug itself is smaller than sky high 1/0 lug, which was kinda nice because I am working on tight space. I did try the 2/0 lug on some sky high 2/0 and there’s no chance it would go in. Maybe if you force a ton, but even then it won’t work. I couldn’t even get the head of the wire in and these lugs are flared outwards too. I haven’t crimped them yet but I will soon, I’ll update the review when I get to crimping stage. But as of now, they get a 5/5 for fitting oversized 1/0 car audio wire. Update 3/6/22: crimping is absolutely awesome. I have two types of crimpers, hydraulics and handheld $30 crimpers from amazon. I decided to use the handheld crimper, even though it doesn't go up to 2/0 size. Stuck it on the 1/0 setting and did 2 crimps at the bottom and top of the lug. Had my dad pull one end of the wire while I held the lug end of the wire. We both pulled as hard as we could and it didn't even move. I'd say they work as intended.",

Because it is water and oil resistant, the jacket should last a very long time against whatever gets flung onto it.

What I like ~ • Feels like quality wire ~ the jacket feels like higher end microphone cabling. It's also fairly flexible and easy to shape. • Looks like quality wire ~ as advertised, UL is clearly marked and the jacketing appears to be uniform in thickness around the inner insulators. Copper is tinned and spun neatly. What I do not like ~ nothing to note here."

The insulation is thick, still flexible enough to work with. I used it on a 24V Solar power project and on a car sound system; it worked perfectly on both projects. The insulation looks and feels more “rubberized” than “hard plastic”, which gives the wire the flexibility needed, specifically for when you have to run the wire through panels, and it helps routing too, it looks more neat and easier to secure it. For the price listed, and for the specifications being accurate, I think this product is a good purchase."

If you see this review on a different item, then there are either multiple item options, or the listed item was changed. I picked this up to finally put my aftermarket subwoofer and amp in my car after putting it off for a long time. Often enough, a lot of audio systems are wired up using 16 or 18 gauge wire, but I wanted something thicker to transmit more efficiently and not possibly run hot, so this 14 gauge spool was perfect. At 20 cents per foot, it is a good value. Now I can't say that my ear can distinguish any difference in audio, but I like knowing the thicker wire is there and will handle whatever I throw at it."

Mine came as a twisted mess that looks unprofessional and not really useable for anything more than auto speaker wire. Looks like just a haphazard cut from a much larger spool. Biggest complaint is it stinks up whatever room it is in. It is potent and I think the manufacturer knew this because it came double bagged. I thought the busted sauce that was in the Amazon box this came together in was what smelled up the box but several days later it's definitely the wire as I can smell it from 8 feet away. The price isn't bad and the copper wire itself seems ok. But the jacket used isn't useable for any code regulated work and it's only marking is the meter length interval. The jacket is also pretty thin and the inside wiring easy twists and came twisted. I wouldn't recommend it for anything beyond audio or LED work where the load is rather light."

I have bought this twice because it's strong, predictable, flexible enough to wrap around itself by hand on a screw eye, absolutely rust free, and forgiving of my putting a ridiculous amount of tension on it. It will hold my excessive unhealthy weight. I can shove spare extra lumber on top of this wire after stringing it across the bottom edges of open rafters in the garage. Has never broken nor stretched over the 24 inch spaces it spans. ALL steel wire will stretch, depending on how you work it, over longer distances. However, I haven't re-tensioned the first roll at all since stringing a bunch of lights three years ago. One run is 53 feet with 50 lights on it. I needed something like this because it's ruinous to the light string to put any meaningful tension directly to a string and so you have to support the string on something like this. Don't bother with cables as that's huge and expensive overkill and they're hard to terminate. Don't use poly or fabric line; they WILL sag. If you have problems with the wire keeping some of its curl, that's absolutely normal. It's coiled steel! Add much tension and then back off a bit. Remember that light strings have a significant straightening effect. If it's snarling when you try to unwind it, most likely you're uncoiling from the outside, not the inside end. Been that way since they invented the stuff a few centuries ago. OR you can unroll it from the outside end after mounting it like a wheel to a horizontal bar (F-clamp, broom handle or pipe propped in a step ladder, and such)."

I got this as I am working on re-wiring a utility trailer and have had problems with the standard trailer wiring in the past deteriorating from the weather. This wire should not have that problem. Also, the included heat shrink tubing for the connections and the wire ties mean that It is something less that I will need to purchase separately.

Don't bother with CCA (copper clad aluminum) wire because not only do the strands break very easily, it does not hold up very well when exposed to moisture because it corrodes very quickly. If you've ever had wiring on a trailer fail on you without any signs of physical damage, most likely it was made out of CCA wire.

        "RV projects<<<5 fifty foot rolls of 5 colors|||B0CLBHT8YX ★★★★☆ [2024-03-27] <b>Good for small projects</b> It seems I'm always scrounging for sections of wire on different RV projects and usually find something leftover from an older finished project that works but maybe is not the best (such as by adding pigtails). This has 5 fifty foot rolls of 5 colors that should end the scrounging. This is a copper clad aluminum core (CCA) wire. The copper reduces corrosion caused by moisture and oxidation and adds surface conductivity. I got it to use for some small 12V wiring projects in the RV (additional 12 volt computer fan for gas refrigerator cooling) and to have on hand when I just need some short lengths of wire. For reference, Cu Clad Al (CCA) wire can be used for main wire projects but at a much larger gauge as aluminum has a higher resistance than copper. 12 AWG is recommended for a 15 Amp 110V circuit and 10 AWG for a 20 Amp. This is a 36 strand 16 AWG braided wire so it's not made for heavy loads or 110 volt wiring. Specs are for up to 80 volts. The wire is flexible and there's enough copper coating for it to solder easily to itself. If there's trouble having the wire stick, a copper infused solder works. I used some lead free Rosin Core 2.0 Sn99 Ag0.3 Cu0.7 electronics solder and everything was sucked into the wire and stuck together. I couldn't find the percent by weight of copper anywhere on the rolls, package, or website. The range for CCA is anywhere from 10% to 24% by weight, with the more the better (but also more expensive). 15 small zip ties and 10 heat shrink tubes are included in the box. I'm never going to use this on a main AC wiring project but for small electrical projects, it's a good economical choice and should last a long time. If you don't want 5 colors and a dispenser box, 4-color roll packages of 100'/roll 16AWG of this brand are the same price if you shop around. 4 stars - copper specs not given."

Wire for rear tractor lighting needs to be run along the underside where brush, sticks, briars claw away at it constantly. More than once, I have had wiring damaged or destroyed. I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications. I really like this wire, and I look forward to using it to upgrade my tractor warning lights in preparation for spring. It would be equally suitable for use on a mowers or trailers as well. I think this product will provide adequate protection for wiring in a tough environment for a long time. In fact, with good end connections, I am hopeful that it will last as long as the equipment."

Upon giving a bit of this stuff a 'go test' on re-wiriing new horns on that ol' relic and the same for a new honker on the bike - this stuff worked out better than the stuff I'm used to from a few spools lying around here. U can tell the immediate difference in the flexibility of the sheathing. Like comparing thick racing engine plug wire to the cheap thin stuff. As for any soldering - stuffs great thou higher bond point u can tell its stronger. Any splices r handled with some new solder joint connectors I just happened to snatch up and this stuff worked great in those too. I did find that there is the slight possiblity of tearing open the silicone jacket of this stuff 'easier' over other types due to having easier stripping ability so yankin' on this stuff when routing any wire runs needs to b given some added care to avoid snags on anything sharp.

The main reason why I chose this wire over cheaper wire variety packs is because this wire has silicone insulation which is more durable, flexible, and heat resistant than conventional wire insulation. The silicone insulation did not disappoint. You can see in the video I attached that the insulation is quite resistant to heat and does not melt as easily. Notice the reaction of the bare wire to heat in the video as well. The wire is indeed tinned and when you heat it, the tinning material evaporates and the bare copper wire is left underneath. This is something you should take into consideration when connecting these wires to a terminal since the tinning should be removed in order to get a solid connection. Probably a regular lighter is more suited to this task than a blow torch. Overall I am very satisfied with this wire kit. The wire is all very high quality and perfect for automotive applications due to the heat and wear resistance of the silicone insulation. This kit also comes with a wire stripper, some zip ties, and heat shrink. I could care less about these extras but it might be a nice perk if you don't have these items already. I would highly recommend this kit if you need a variety of different colored wires for an automotive project. The silicone insulation is the best you can get."

        "Boat applications<<<Helps prevent corrosion of copper|||B0CN9FNFZC ★★★☆☆ [2024-01-19] <b>Handy multi-conductor cable; probably not quite 18ga?</b> As the title says, this multi-conductor cable will come in handy for a number of my DIY projects. Since some of those may involve something on my boat, having tinned conductors is a real plus -- it does help prevent corrosion of the copper, and you can see the tinned strands in one of my included photos. My one issue with this product is the claim that the conductors are 18 gauge. Granted, I don't plan to use this anywhere that I'll be pushing the limits of an 18ga wire, but I did want at least to test the claims. I don't have a great way of measuring the diameter of the wire, especially with twisted strands. This is technically what the wire gauge means. However, a wire's resistance is a function of its cross-sectional area, and there are numerous free online calculators to let you determine what the resistance of a certain gauge of wire should be for a given length of wire. Here's what you do: Search for wire resistance calculator Enter 18 gauge and 50 ft You get 0.319 ohms Measure the resistance of one conductor for the entire 50' spool Compare your resistance reading to what it should be As shown, I used the red conductor (they should all be the same) and I got between 0.38 and 0.40 ohms. Since the resistance is higher than it should be for 18 gauge, I can know with reasonable certainty that the wire is smaller than 18 gauge. In fact, a 19 gauge wire (uncommon in the US) should be right at 0.403 ohms for 50' of wire. This all may not sound like much, but the resistance is over 22% higher than it should be for 18ga, which means that you're getting 22% less copper than you're expecting. All that's to say that this product seems fine, and as long as you're not depending on the full conductivity of a true 18 gauge wire, you'll be good. However, I tend to score products pretty harshly when they make claims that they can't hold up to, and sadly that's the case with this cable. Buy it and use it, eyes wide open, or buy something else if you need a true 18 gauge wire."

        "Marine projects<<<Resistant to corrosion|||B0BGS5GRSK ★★★★★ [2023-10-24] <b>Reliable and Versatile</b> I recently purchased the 18 Gauge Wire 2 Conductor Electrical Wire for my automotive and lighting projects, and I am extremely satisfied with its performance. This wire is perfect for low voltage applications, such as automotive wiring, LED strips, lamp lighting, and marine projects. Therefore, I am giving it a five-star rating. The wire is made of high-quality 18 AWG stranded PVC cord, which provides excellent flexibility and durability. I have found that this flexibility makes it easy to route the wire in tight spaces and around corners without any issues. Additionally, the stranded construction ensures that the wire is resistant to breakage and can withstand the rigors of demanding applications. The tinned copper conductors are another great feature of this wire. The tinning process adds a layer of protection to the copper, making it more resistant to corrosion and extending the lifespan of the wire. This is particularly important for marine applications, where exposure to moisture and saltwater can be a concern. The 18/2 wire configuration, with two conductors, is suitable for a wide range of electrical projects. It allows for easy connection of various components, such as LED strips, lamps, switches, and more. The wire is color-coded, with one conductor in red and the other in black, making it simple to identify and connect the positive and negative terminals correctly. The length of the wire, 100ft (30.48m), provides ample supply for most projects, allowing for flexibility in routing and installation. The wire is neatly packaged and easy to handle, without any tangles or kinks. I have used this wire extensively in my automotive projects, and it has performed flawlessly. The low voltage rating of 12V ensures safe and reliable operation without any risk of electrical hazards. The wire's insulation is of high quality and provides excellent protection against short circuits and electrical interference. Overall, the 18 Gauge Wire 2 Conductor Electrical Wire is a reliable and versatile option for various electrical applications. Its flexibility, tinned copper conductors, and durable construction make it ideal for automotive, lighting, marine, and other low voltage projects. I would rate this wire five out of five stars for its quality, performance, and versatility. It has met and exceeded my expectations, and I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable and durable electrical wire for their projects."

The crimper, wire stripper, and screwdriver are medium quality, excellent for DIYers, but not a pro. The connectors are very good, like other Konbur connectors I've used. There are two pairs of gloves included, not sure I'll use those. The case has room for additional tools in the top which I'll add a multi-driver, pliers, and other assorted tools. The wire stripper is sharp and works well. The crimper works well, but doesn't crimp the smallest connectors in the set very well (I would have given 5 stars if the crimper worked better on the small connectors). I used the Tip of the wire stripper to finish the crimps for the small connectors. Everything said, I like this set."

Various sizes of shrink tubing are included to finish off any application. Comes with a nice selection of lever style hard connectors that can be reused.

This is an upgraded crimper, that is multitudes better than the old style hand crimper that used to be a part of these kits. The wire strippers work perfect to prepare the wires and also included is a pair of work gloves. One thing I found out using this kit is there are no instructions as to usage, when prepping wires for terminals, especially the barrel connectors to splice together wires, make sure you strip only about 1/4” of wire or as in case of the barrel connector, issues can result. Other then the lack of a strip gauge this kit is well supplied and can be a godsend when a problem occurs our during a installation."

The cords are permanently attached to the panels and cannot be replaced, so I didn't want them exposed constantly to sunlight and weather. So I ordered a 10' roll of the 3/8th\" tubing. I measure out how much cable length I'd need plus a little slack, then I wrapped the excess around one or both of the panel/camera mounts (depending on how much unused cable length there'd be) and wrapped self-bonding silicone tape around the cable to secure/waterproof/protect it. Then I cut an appropriate length of the split tubing and slipped it over the exposed cable between the two, then for some cameras where necessary I cut a smaller piece or two and added them to the small amount of slack I left after the wrapping. Where appropriate I wrapped a small amount of the silicone tape on the ends to keep it in place/further waterproof it. This gives a clean, finished, and professional look. I was impressed with the results so much I've ordered more additional cameras, as well as to help reorganize some computer cable routing.

        "House rewiring<<<Copper wire|||B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ [2023-06-30] <b>Great for DIYers and reasonably priced for copper with silicone insulation</b> The price for copper wire has gone up so dramatically in the last few years, I did a lot of rewiring in my house a few years back and a spool of 12/2 1000 feet Romex was $260 and now over $500 a roll at Lowes or HomeDepot. The prices for these spools are cheaper than similar PVC coated wires at Walmart for 20 gauge wire and these have more expensive silicone coating and tinned copper. Price wise these are very good wires and good for small projects or repairs on electronics. The wire is very flexible and good for replacing cheaper wires in outdoor equipment that are subject to the elements or chemicals. The silicone is good for almost degrees 400F which is great for power and heating equipment as they are more chemical resistant and won't melt as easily. I have two outdoor portable water heaters used for camping and the wiring on the units use the cheaper PVC and the insulation can melt when the heaters are used for extended periods. I have had to wrap the wires in aluminum heat wrap to protect the PVC cables now I can repair them with the silicone wires without having to wrap them with protective aluminum heat shields."

The cord looks as good in person as the photos show. It is a reasonable facsimile for either replacing antiquated electrical wiring in old lamps and such, or adding a little extra visual flair to current devices. Of course, when replacing old wiring, you are also gaining the safety of a cord that is using modern insulating materials, which is much safer at this point, than older wiring which may have very dry and brittle insulation layers between the strands of wire. The only comment I can make about it that may be a negative factor for some is that the cord is round, rather than most lamp cord that tends to be a bit flattened. This may also have something to do with this cord being a little stiffer than the typical lamp cord you may be most familiar with."

For years I have used a system where I disconnect my electric fence by hand to open my gates without getting shocked. I dug a small trench about 6\" deep under a couple of my gates and buried the RiteFENCE, and left each end protrude out of the ground about two feet to connect to one of the lower existing fence wires so as not to disconnect the continuous circuit at any time when opening gates now. I chose the 6\" depth to bury the heavily insulated RiteFENCE since in addition to moving livestock through the gates, I also drive vehicles and farm implements through the gates as well. The RiteFENCE is very sturdy and rigid, and the 12-½ gauge took some time to straighten out to fit flat and neatly into the trenches I dug and placed the wire into, but this is a definite plus for electric fence wire to be used on a farm or ranch. The RiteFENCE doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and has a thick outer coating with the inner wire apparently coated as well for the 'double insulation' aspect. When installing, I also cut back a couple of inches of the RiteFENCE on each end and used a heavy duty crimp connection to the barb wire fencing I use. Once crimped, I neatly wrapped the connections with quality electrical tape to seal from the elements. The RiteFENCE is going to be ideal for many other underground connection needs I have around the farm. I would highly recommend any farmers and ranchers who run electric fence to give the RiteFENCE a try if you want to eliminate the risk of a nasty shock, especially with the higher powered fence chargers. The price point seems very fair and in fact is actually a little cheaper than what I saw at my local farm supply store. Highly recommend!",

With a normal 12 gage Romex that you would run for 120v house power it bleeds so much power that my power unit could barely keep up with the losses.

I’m in a wilderness area, with a lot of large and small animals that would like to breach that fence, so the electrical system is super important. I’m setting up another wired enclosure around the separate garage, and I need to run a live wire underground to it. This flexible, reasonably heavy-duty double-insulated wire is ideal. It’s made for “direct burial.” It has to be quality, because if there’s a breach, the current will short out and be lost. It comes on a decent spool that makes paying it out relatively easy."

Be sure you know what you're buying. This is ultra flexible, with many super-fine strands and silicone rubber insulation marked 200C (higher than PVC but lower than PTFE). The fine strands (150 of them, but I didn't count!) can be a bit of a challenge when crimping contacts... make sure no microscopic strands escape the crimp -- then it works great. The insulation is thick but soft: very easy to work with but also easily damaged if used in the wrong application. It's the right cable for routing in tight locations, since it's so willing to bend and lay flat... good for DIY drones (flexing arms or retracting legs) or making wiring harnesses that need to flex but are well protected from abrasion and pinching. For more rugged high-temp insulation, consider PTFE but it is much more difficult to work with and hard to find at a reasonable price. As noted by others, some colors are a bit off. Red is clearly orange, and blue is gray-purple. That's okay for my purposes, but maybe not if you are building to a print for assemblies that will be inspected. The velcro wraps keep each spool neat, and the box is good for organizing these spools when lots of other wire spools are around."

The conductors are fine stranded, tinned copper, which is a thin protective coating on the copper to keep it from corroding in harsh environments such as ocean areas, or auto applications where winter road salting can cause problems. Despite what other reviewers have said, this is indeed copper wire, but the “tinning” process makes the wire appear silver unless you look at the cut end. It is typically used with crimp connectors in most applications. There is no indication that this wire is UL listed, so I would not use it for home-wiring applications or any 120 volt (or higher) AC current. The silicone insulation and fine stranding make this wire very flexible, so perfect for sharp turns and pulling through tight locations like behind the dash. The 14 gauge that I used is good for any circuits of up to 10 amps unless they are longer than 25 feet or so. Remember to calculate for both positive and negative lengths, and whether you can afford any voltage drop in your circuit.

I have had to throw away pure copper wire from the 70s since it develops green oxidation and is a pain to clean but have yet to have to clean tinned copper before crimping or soldering. This wire has fewer strands that are larger and a heavy PVC outer coating, compared to the small strand silicon coated wire I use for RC helicopters. This makes it stiffer, easier to route, and tougher. I wouldn't hesitate to walk on this wire or pull it across metal edges that would cut silicon insulation. The larger strands are also better for crimping since smaller strands are more likely to break at the crimp.

Sheathing smooth and easy to pull.</b> This seems like good wire for outdoor and automotive applications. The stranded copper conductors are tinned, and the ends already have a dab of solder. I'll be using heat shrink crimp connectors, so trimmed off the soldered tips. The PVC sheathing on this wire is smooth and I was able to easily pull it through a conduit to replace an old wire with just some electrical tape joining the ends. Tested with a light drawing 2 amps, and only detected a .3V voltage drop across the entire 50 foot coil. Sold as 12V low voltage wire, but rated for 300V. I like that this wire is rated for direct burial and waterproof, so long as it remains undamaged. It's easy enough to slide this through some conduit or at least sections of old garden hose or something to make it more durable and resist chafing. The PVC sleeve is somewhat loose and the individual wires can be removed from short sections fairly easily. Not very flexible, but easy enough to bend.

We have a subpanel outside for our pool equipment, so it was easy to trench from that panel over to our firepit. I added 3 couple outlets, one for our string lights (that one is mounted up high on the post to the left) and the other two for people who may want to charge their phone, plug in a heated blanket, etc. It's easy to run the wire now but would be a pain to add later once rock is added to the inside of the pit, so I tried to think ahead as much as possible. I ran liquid tight conduit from the panel to the firepit, it's unnecessary as this cable is made for direct burial, however I wanted the added protection as it's near our pool plumbing and wiring, and also wanted the option to pull additional wire if necessary. I ran the conduit from underground up the side of the posts, since they are backfilled with concrete I wanted the ability to pull wire through if something needed to be replaced rather than having the wire itself ran through the concrete and up the post. I used the Ideal wire strippers to remove the sheathing and also strip the conductor wires, worked great and worth the money.",

None of the outdoor ones I’ve used have held up to the heat and arid climate even in conduit. so I decided to give the silicone casing a try. It’s a small section of wire that always seems to get eaten by the heat even when it’s in conduit. So far so good and I expect the silicone casing to hold up a lot longer than the pvc. Nice wire kit for the price and am confident it will out live the single strand pvc cased wire it replaced."

I have used wires before, and know how to strip wires (have a wire stripper and all) So, this worked really well for me. I have a transformer that I attached the wire to and I went around my yard with the wire making sure to leave a lot of slack for if I need to adjust the lights. I didn't bury it yet as I'm still adding lights, but so far, so good. I haven't had any issues with it fraying or being too hard to twist the strands together. They do as wires are supposed to do. I have waterproof connectors that I use, but this is my first time using outdoor wiring. So far, it has rained last night and I didn't notice any issues. The lights worked all night long and when my transformer got the light of the day, it shut off well too. I needed this because I ran out of wire, so this extra makes me able to finalize my setup. I have had no issues so far, and it fits in my connectors just fine. My lights at the end of my strand are just as bright as the ones at the beginning. I like it. It works for me!

I would take 'outdoor rated' with a grain of salt</b> TL;DR version: If you intend to use this cable in an outdoor environment, I would look elsewhere. I have used several spools of this company's 3 conductor wire for various projects and it has worked out well. The conductors are not undersized, and the outer cable sheath is properly tough. So I decided to give their 2 conductor wire a try. It turned out to be a very oddly constructed 2 conductor cable. My biggest issue is that the outer protective layer is MUCH bigger than required. It is literally the same outer sheath size as the 3 conductor cable I have used often - it literally appears that they just pulled one conductor out of their 3 conductor cable, put it on a reel, and sold it. This is not great for a couple of reasons: 1) The cable is thicker than it needs to be (not space efficient), so anyone working with limited space for their wire runs, or wire runs that are visible (like low voltage outdoor LED lighting), may want to look elsewhere. 2) This stuff says it is outdoor rated. However it is outdoor rated for UV exposure only. Because there is so much empty space within the outer jacket, anyone wanting to use this outdoors in damp climates or around water (irrigation wiring, landscape lighting, etc) should realize that the outer jacket is going to rapidly fill up with water (and stay filled), causing several types of issues: - Electric issues: any minor wire scrapes or damage could result in hard-to-trace shorts or random voltage drops. - Extra water weight: The extra weight all of that water filling up the PVC jacket could be significant. I intended to use this cable for outdoor permanent installations of LED light strings, hung or mounted in various ways on my house and in landscaping. I live in a wet climate, and after a few months of rainy fall/winter/spring weather I estimate that the added weight of all that water filling up the empty space within the cable jacket would more than double the total weight of the cable runs. With a couple hundred feet of cable, that weight will add up pretty quickly. - Water damage: Depending on how/where your cabling is routed, you could essentially be installing a de-facto water pipe that will shunt rain and/or irrigation water through the excess space within the outer jacket and into areas of your walls/house that would otherwise have remained perfectly dry. A potential recipe for serious hidden water damage. I ended up returning this and buying a different product elsewhere."

When the package arrived some of the slotted caps had already slipped out of the wire nuts--they don't hold tightly to the nut. There don't appear to be any ridges that they pop into to keep them in place. And even once you put them back, once you put a couple wires in and start tightening, the slotted plastic is pretty stiff and they easily spin and fall out. The bigger problem is the nuts are only about half full of silicone--which is absurd. When you insert the wires and start turning, no silicone oozes out the end cap--so there's not even enough silicone in there to help keep the caps in place--so they easily pop off. If you're not careful about how much wire you strip, it's definitely not going to be sufficiently protected from the elements for a weather resistant connection. Honestly, I'll probably toss most of these out. My low voltage connections are not typically in places that are especially easy to access. I'd rather use a quality connector that I'm confident will last so I don't have to keep working under my deck to access the connections."

The braided design and black color of the cord give a classic and professional look to the final product.

The trick then is finding fabric-wrapped cord that is safe and at least has the appearance of electrical cord from the 20s and 30s. Luckily, a variety of providers have arisen over the past few years. Here we have one where most of the work has been done for you, with the AC plug already connected. Now there's no question that this is a contemporary AC plug, and if you're doing a genuine restoration, you probably won't go this route, but there's also no question that this is a safe approach and one that is probably going to be hidden by furniture anyway. In this case, the fabric wrap covers two independently insulated wires, already stripped and soldered and ready to be wired directly into your device, lamp, appliance, etc. The fabric has a nice sheen and looks great; I picked the brown color to go with a copper lamp - works perfectly.",

        "Rewiring antique lamps<<<Aesthetically pleasing cloth covering|||B0BRN8DWTL ★★★★★ [2023-03-07] <b>Beautiful appearance and high quality vintage style appliance wire</b> I was immediately struck that the cloth covering on this wire is so aesthetically pleasing. It looks and feels great to the touch; much better than the cloth covered wire from back in the day. I suspect the reason is that the modern 'cloth' contains some synthetics that weren't available 75 years ago. But this wire fits in fine with genuine vintage items, and this cloth is much more durable than the old stuff. I will be using it to rewire an old vintage lamp to get rid of the vinyl/plastic modern wire. I think it is a good choice to re-wire a valuable antique item as well. This wire is flexible but not as limp as most appliance wire. At first I thought the reason must be solid copper instead of stranded copper inside, which would be very strange. It's stranded not solid, however, and the lack of limpness is because the black-coated and white-coated copper stranded wires inside are embedded in a PVC 'cord' that is completely solid. In other words, there isn't a PVC tubing containing the 2 inner wires but rather a solid mass of PVC. Thus the whole thing is sturdier and heftier than it would be if it were a cloth covering over a PVC tubing containing 2 wires. Well done, as the resulting heft makes this wire seem substantial which adds a beautiful aesthetic to any vintage item. Once my re-wiring job is done if I learn any more I'll come back and edit this review."

Even when they have a plastic underneath, this plastic often predates vinyl, and may crack and split. These wires become an electrical shock or fire hazard. I've been meaning to rewire an antique art deco lamp whose power cord has started to worry me. I haven't done so because the wire I had, with visible plastic insulation, would look out of place on the lamp. This wire, with a rayon covering over the round plastic insulation, will look just fine. As you can see in the photo I uploaded, the wires are copper colored, not tinned as described in the product description. Tinning is the process of coating the copper wire with solder, which would make it silver colored. Tinning reduces the oxidation or corrosion of the copper, but unless you live in a marine environment, it probably won't be a problem."

I love those old lamps that survived the test of time. Unfortunately, most are unsafe because age has destroyed the wiring and plugs, and of course, some never needed to pass a UL inspection. Changing a cord out is not that hard. If you can do it yourself, do it. If you like those Edison bulbs this cord will add to the charm of the right light fixture."

The high power one has a red cable and i wanted a different cable to differentiate the lower power output so blue worked for me.

I also liked that there's a cable tie included with each cable making storage in my car's center console nice and neat. Since this came with two cables, I used the other one at my desk in my office to charge my phone. I have a Samsung wireless charging pad and this fits perfectly. It doesn't charge too fast, though, so if i need a quick charge or if i want to charge while i use my phone, i can unplug the charging pad and plug directly into my phone for a high powered fast charge.

Although some laptops do support charging over USB-C above 100W, so if you're buying this to charge a laptop, check the power rating on your charger brick."

The first thing I noticed about them is that the materials are so much nicer than my old cables. The thick nylon braiding doesn’t tangle. The ends are thick and tough, with metal accents. The light grey color looks a lot better than the cheap black and white cables that come with electronic devices. In terms of performance, I’ve found them to be fast. They support PD3.0 fast charging. I’m using them with the Voltme 30W GaN III charger bloc, and I’ve tried them directly to my LG G7 phone as well as with an Eazpower wireless charger – these combinations charge my phone more than twice as fast as my original LG charger and cable. I also use them with the Voltme charger for miscellaneous small electronic devices, with no problems. A nice extra – each cable comes with a velcro tie attached, which is always appreciated, especially with a 6-foot cable.

They're rather thick which i wasn't expecting, but it actually makes them easier to find in the dark, especially if you have multiple cables. I bought this pack primarily for one cable to use in my car. I have a car charger that has 2 USB-C outputs. One is higher powered than the other. The high power one has a red cable and i wanted a different cable to differentiate the lower power output so blue worked for me. Again, the thickness of the cable (which doesn't really have any effect on it's flexibility) helps me locate this particular one in the dark of my car without having to turn on the lights. I also liked that there's a cable tie included with each cable making storage in my car's center console nice and neat. Since this came with two cables, I used the other one at my desk in my office to charge my phone. I have a Samsung wireless charging pad and this fits perfectly. It doesn't charge too fast, though, so if i need a quick charge or if i want to charge while i use my phone, i can unplug the charging pad and plug directly into my phone for a high powered fast charge. The cable definitely handles it well! I couldn't be happier with this cable set!"

No fault to the seller or product, Amazon had the “order this + this + this” option for the end connectors and clamps, which you’ll also need, but it gives you a wrong size for the end clamps. The 3/4” mounting straps are the right size, but 3/4” ends to secure this 6/3 MC cable to your metal boxes is way to big. I ended up having to make a trip to the hardware store to buy smaller 1/2” end clamps instead of the 3/4” ones Amazon was recommending. I love working with MC cable, but its always a pain trying to determine the correct size anti short bushings, end caps, mounting straps etc to go with it. The sizes are all over the place depending on the gauge and number of wires and none of the sellers actually specify what size additional parts are needed to match up with it. As a side note, its also always confusing how sometimes it’ll state (for example) “6/3 wire” where you’d expect it to be three #6 wires total but in reality there are 4 wires, black, red, white and green. There isn’t always consistency in this, sure would be a lot easier if the standard was to count the actual number of wires, including the ground. This 6/3 MC cable in particular is actually four total 6 AWG wires, black, red, white, green for those that aren’t sure. It’s also rated for up to 55 Amps, which is perfect for wiring in a 50 amp RV, Dryer, or Oven outlet. Even if say your dryer outlet only requires 2 hots and a ground (6/2) with no neutral (old style), go ahead and run this (6/3) wire anyhow and just don’t use the extra wire, you’ll be doing yourself a future proof favor for the day when you replace that old appliance and discover the new one requires all 4 wires. Easier, and cheaper to just not use the extra wire now than trying to add another wire later.",

Not only is it flexible, but my soldering won't scorch the silicone like it will PVC jacketed wire, as silicone has a much higher tolerance for heat than PVC. I tested the resistance of each of the two strands, and both came back exactly 1.2 Ohms resistance, which means two things. #1, most importantly, the wire is not broken internally in either strand, there are no opens. #2, my volt meter is consistently lousy and at least measures off the mark twice equally. What I mean by this is that at this length, according to spec, there should be 15.88 milliohms (mΩ) of resistance in 10' of 12ga copper wire, which is far too sensitive for my cheap meter to measure. So I don't know why my meter is reading 1.2 ohms, but my guess is that is not exactly correct, and the actual resistance is functionally closer to 0 ohms. Anyway, this wire is perfect for chaining together a few LiFePO4 12V batteries in parallel for a solar-charged power station I'm building. Just got to crimp some spade terminals on and it will be perfect for my project. Also, LOL at the brand name... Dastard?? lol really?",

I use 20- or 22-gauge silicone wires for the balance leads, and lower-gauge wires such as these for the charge leads. Typical of silicone wires, these are super flexible. They appear to be decent quality. I have no problems soldering these wires to XT90 and bullet connectors. Unlike other silicone wires I’ve purchased, which are loose wires. The black and red wires on these are bonded together like on a zip cord. This may or may not be an advantage depending on your application.

The outer insulating jacket is thick PVC (I used the 12awg notch of my stripper to strip it). Perfect for landscape lights or general DIY project wire. It bonded wire but easy to seperate the conductors. One is stamped with the wire specs, the other is ridged for easy polarity identification. Accepts crimps and soldering well. I'm currently working on wiring 4 20-watt solar panels together in parallel with this wire. Should be good to make low current draw expension cords, too. So, nothing negative to say about this wire, and I would recommend it and will get it again myself."

Regardless of the type of add-a-tap or gilbert style plug you're attempting to install on these things, the diameter of the cord is really important. If it's too big, your taps and plugs simply won't fit. SPT-1 cord is supposed to have a much thinner insulation that SPT-2. I specifically chose this cord because it is listed as being SPT-1. Well...I nearly broke my thumbs trying to jam this into the Gilbert plug I bought. And then the first add-a-tap female plug I tried to install snapped in half because of the inordinate amount of pressure I had to apply to get it to close. I ended up having to file away some of the insulation so I could install my female plug. So if you're buying this cable with the idea of installing plugs on it, and you're not sure it will fit...well...it probably won't fit."

Thick enough for power and ground but thin enough to run in tight spaces and make turns. I've already used most of this roll on butt connectors, soldered joints and distribution blocks and the pvc insulation is strong enough for direct burial on low voltage landscape lighting.

I always use the appropriate gauge and type of wire and 18 gauge is a frequent pick. It is useful for medium-draw circuits like LV power supplies and LED lighting. The color-coding is particularly useful for the same reasons. I like my Red Green Blue & White wires to my LEDs to actually be RGBW in color. This kit has enough wire for several small projects and also comes with colored shrink tubing and colored wire ties.

This kit is particularly appealing for its thoughtful compilation of essential wiring needs, presented in a user-friendly package. Variety and Quality: One of the standout features of this kit is the variety it offers—eight colors of 18 gauge silicone wire, each extending to 23 feet (7 meters). While the length of each spool might not cater to extensive projects, the assortment allows for ample experimentation and small-scale builds. The choice of silicone for the wire sheathing is a commendable one, providing a durable, heat-resistant covering that forgives the occasional soldering mishap, making it an ideal selection for beginners. Additionally, silicone's chemical resistance and flexibility are qualities that veteran electronics enthusiasts will appreciate. Accessories and Utility: The inclusion of color-coordinated heat shrink tubing and zip ties adds a layer of organization and professionalism to projects, enhancing the overall utility of the kit. While the wire stripper may not impress seasoned users, it's a valuable addition for those just starting, offering an all-in-one solution to basic wiring needs. Packaging and Design: The kit's packaging is notably well-conceived, featuring a box with holes for each wire spool, facilitating easy access and storage. This system helps maintain a clean and organized workspace, a boon for any project. However, the opportunity for improvement lies in the visibility of the remaining wire on each spool; a clear plastic window on the box would have perfectly rounded out the design by allowing users to gauge their wire stock at a glance. Conclusion: In summary, the 18 Gauge Wire Kit earns a solid five-star rating not through groundbreaking innovation but through the thoughtful assembly of high-quality components tailored to meet the needs of both novice and experienced electronics enthusiasts. It stands out as a comprehensive and practical kit, perfect for anyone looking to embark on or expand their electronics projects with a reliable selection of wires and tools at their disposal."

Besides the fact that half the harnesses on Amazon have the wiring color wrong (when you plug them together, the wire colors are reversed), a lot of harnesses are not well designed. They might not make solid connections or might even fail / fall apart. This was not an option for me for this project (or most projects). By contrast, these harnesses make an extremely solid connection. Not loose at all and weather-tight. I'm using this in a pretty critical application and would not hesitate to do so even if exposed to the elements. I do not consider the price unreasonable, the only downside was waiting a little longer for arrival, not a big deal."

The 40 individual strands make the wire very flexible, which makes routing them through tight spaces easy. The conductors come pre-tinned, making soldering quick and reducing the chance of having cold solder joints. The six spools of wire come in a compact cardboard box that doubles as a dispenser, preventing the wire from un-spooling in your toolbox or bag. There is also space inside the box to store a small number of colored wire ties and the wire stripper that comes with the wire. This wire is a quality wire at a very affordable price."

Insulation is really soft, and doesn't easily kink and hold memory like cheaper wire. Additional premium touches - you would think how many \"features\" could a cable have, yet here we are: 1. Rubber cable end caps, which I assume are meant to protect the cut copper ends from oxidizing over long periods of storage. 2. A velcro tie. 3. Low odor. At least compared to some cheaper wire, which can instantly stink up my entire room. Last but not least, this cable is made in Korea by a company that is itself compliant to very strict standards. So personally I automatically expect higher quality compared to a certain other country where most cables are made, and by every indication this meets those expectations. Highly recommended if you can afford the premium, and/or need it for critical applications that need to be standard compliant."

I don't remember when I've worked with wire this flexible. The Silicone is so 'rubbery' it's almost hard to cut and both the insulation and the wire is as flexible as the insulation. It doesn't 'hold' a shape well at all it's just so flexible. The high temp insulation makes it nice for soldering, it doesn't shrink off or split out from the heat of nearby soldering - and the temp range is also low (cold). I didn't test it, but the low end spec is -76F.. (So obviously I'd have something special around to make any claim about testing it anywhere near that.) I'll have to pickup a couple new rolls for my next trip to Antarctica (lol). It's a whole bunch heavier at 10 gauge than I normally use but I have a couple projects that will use up most of, if not all of the rolls. I'm adding fog lights to my car and I'm rewiring a couple speakers. It feels so nice that if I have any left, I may just rig up a new set of test leads for my multi-meter. Also available in smaller gauges, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 & 22, those other sizes are probably more commonly used and more in line with the size I'd usually pickup for small general purpose projects - but the fog lights, can draw a bunch of current, so for a 10 ft run in a car, this can handle >200 watts, or plenty enough for my fog lights.",

Long story short, I have suddenly, with no dislike to how I used to vape for 4 years, become an all day Mtl vaper, without noticing that it has been every day since June! This is solely due to the nature of naturally extracted tobacco liquids, which are incredibly different from each other in terms of profiles it’s a vast rich flavourful world that I am discovering, however these are such nuanced experiences that above 18 watts they become muted, so NOW I get mtl, the fancy rtas, and even the ones I already owned without realising that I was grossly limiting to those “bathroom breaks” at work. Nah, satisfaction and it’s management will always be the key, this wire believe it or not is already considered in many situations to overheat and mute small chambers ect. or at least that would be the concern, but in my case it has only brought out new layers especially with Kentucky and Latakia."

So I spend about 3 hours doing all the prepping, and then installing it, with a hairdryer and a plastic card to flatten the cable as I went. Everything went pretty well and I was able to enjoy a movie that night. My plan was to add texture and paint the next day. The very next day I woke up to half of the cable detached from the wall. Total disaster. Re-installing it is a total pain. I contacted support and they told me that the textured wall shouldn't be a problem and to try again. What I did was to redo the installation in the baseboard. The results, after a couple of weeks, has been the same. The cable is starting to detach in some areas and now I'm wondering if I should add a stronger glue (very messy) or change cables (after the big investment on these ones).

I ran liquid tight conduit from the panel to the firepit, it's unnecessary as this cable is made for direct burial, however I wanted the added protection as it's near our pool plumbing and wiring, and also wanted the option to pull additional wire if necessary. I ran the conduit from underground up the side of the posts, since they are backfilled with concrete I wanted the ability to pull wire through if something needed to be replaced rather than having the wire itself ran through the concrete and up the post.

        "Behind drywall where not subject to damage<<<Nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable|||B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★☆ [2023-06-05] <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again)."

I did this by drilling a 3/16 hole in both sides and looping this wire around a short piece of rebar on one side and then tieing in another piece of rebar on the other side and twisting the rebar to twist the wire to take up slack. I would use a thicker wire if I was to do it again and also would put a short piece of rebar on the center, too as I had two pieces of wire pull out of the concrete after it set up leaving a very small hole in the wall. All in all the wire was easy to work with but like I said just a little small for this application as a couple pieces broke and I had to cut a new piece."

        "Installation on textured walls<<<Doesn't stay stuck to wall|||B079NXCN6B ★☆☆☆☆ [2020-04-17] <b>Started peeling off in less than a day</b> It doesn't stay stuck to my wall. I followed the instructions and watched the video beforehand. I wiped the wall with a damp microfiber to remove any dust and let it dry. I then applied the Ghost Wire starting at one end, peeling about a foot of the backing off at a time, smoothing it and rubbing it to the wall. Working the wrinkles out as I went along. Within one day, both ends of the run had about 6 inches peeling off the wall. Three days later, and both ends are now peeled off about 2 feet. Every morning I've tried to rub it back to the wall. My walls do have a very slight orange peel texture. Perhaps on a smooth finish the Ghost Wire would adhere better. I have not attempted to paint over it yet (and likely won't since it doesn't stay on). The total length of my application was 11.5 feet. Beyond the issue of it not remaining adhered, there were a couple other issues as well. First, there's about 1/8 of clear adhesive which is not covered by the white surface material running down the entire length of the roll. This is very visible (and sticky feeling). I was hoping that I could spray some wall texture over it since paint will likely not cover it correctly. I also snapped off my exposed ends when attaching the end connectors. Since the copper is very thin, any etching done with a razor blade to cleanly expose the copper strips weakens it to the point that any flex will shear it off. I had to peel back and use scissors, leaving a small flap rather than a nice clean transition. My Ghost Wire also was quite wrinkled from being rolled up. The manufacturer states that it's a known issue and recommends a heatgun/hairdryer to remedy so I expected that going in I liked the idea of this product. If it would have stayed on the wall, it would have been great. Even with the problems I had, I could see this working well if run under a carpet. I'm contemplating using a router to notch a shallow channel in the drywall and then just mud over the inserted wire. [update] A week later, and it's completely peeled off. Not an inch is left stuck to the wall. It's just hanging between the two connector blocks that are screwed in."

The conductors are a 'high strand count\" type, meaning that instead of being comprised of just a few larger/thicker strands, it is instead comprised of a much greater number of smaller/thinner strands; and this contributes to its lack of stiffness/great flexibility. The other contributing factor to the high flexibility is that the insulation is silicone rubber, rather than the more common PVC (which is rather stiff). This kind of high strand count, silicone rubber insulated wire is exactly what high quality test equipment 'test leads' have been made of for decades. The silicone rubber is also much less heat sensitive than more common insulations such as PVC or \"machine tool wire\". It won't melt off as readily as PVC insulation does if your soldering iron needs to be held onto a joint or terminal for an extended period of time. The fine wire strands are also nicely tinned, and the insulation strips off easily and cleanly, and the stranded wire solders easily. It is a good quality product at an affordable price. HOWEVER, it is not the best choice for many common \"hook up wire\" applications, since its lack of stiffness can be an issue; the strands definitely need to be twisted and soldered in order to keep their shape enough to be formed into a hook before soldering around a terminal for example. This wire also does not want to cooperate if you want to twist a few of them together, because their limpness makes them uncooperative in that regard. And if you use this wire in \"hook up wire\" applications, it wants to just flop into some odd position rather than 'staying put' where you want it to be. Silicone rubber insulation is also not that great when it comes to abrasion resistance, and resistance to some kinds of oils and such where other insulations may be preferable.",

        "Soldering applications<<<Melt resistant insulation|||B01K4RPB3O ★★★★★ [2023-02-16] <b>Good quality, high strand-count high flexibility tinned wire with silicone rubber insulation</b> This 22 AWG (gauge) silicone insulated wire is excellent for indoor or protected environments where high flexibility/lack of stiffness, and non-melting (or at least melt resistant) insulation is required. The conductors are a 'high strand count\" type, meaning that instead of being comprised of just a few larger/thicker strands, it is instead comprised of a much greater number of smaller/thinner strands; and this contributes to its lack of stiffness/great flexibility. The other contributing factor to the high flexibility is that the insulation is silicone rubber, rather than the more common PVC (which is rather stiff). This kind of high strand count, silicone rubber insulated wire is exactly what high quality test equipment 'test leads' have been made of for decades. The silicone rubber is also much less heat sensitive than more common insulations such as PVC or \"machine tool wire\". It won't melt off as readily as PVC insulation does if your soldering iron needs to be held onto a joint or terminal for an extended period of time. The fine wire strands are also nicely tinned, and the insulation strips off easily and cleanly, and the stranded wire solders easily. It is a good quality product at an affordable price. HOWEVER, it is not the best choice for many common \"hook up wire\" applications, since its lack of stiffness can be an issue; the strands definitely need to be twisted and soldered in order to keep their shape enough to be formed into a hook before soldering around a terminal for example. This wire also does not want to cooperate if you want to twist a few of them together, because their limpness makes them uncooperative in that regard. And if you use this wire in \"hook up wire\" applications, it wants to just flop into some odd position rather than 'staying put' where you want it to be. Silicone rubber insulation is also not that great when it comes to abrasion resistance, and resistance to some kinds of oils and such where other insulations may be preferable."

I'm very pleased with how it has worked out. Had to run the line up the garage wall in a PVC tube and through the ceiling and then back down the wall to the service box and it was relatively easy to do since this wire does not have a heavy outer coating and is relatively easy to manipulate.

It may be PCV, but it strips exactly like Tefzel does and as far as I can tell it would be entirely suitable for use wire-wrapping, especially if you solder your wraps like you really should if you're confident in your schematic. This wire is less likely to tarnish than standard silver-plated wire-wrap wire. It's just the right size for data-level or small-signal connections to transistors and ICs, which move very little current and cannot overheat #30 wire. Any smaller and it would be difficult to work with. Plan your project carefully, so that you never need to solder immediately adjacent to the insulation... because this insulation will absolutely not tolerate soldering temperatures like Tefzel will."

The home inspector we used seemed new to the business, at least that is what I'm chalking his performance up to. I am an electrician, so I know when electrical wiring is up to code and when it isn't. Unfortunately, my house is full of poor wiring, so I have been working on getting everything up to par before I need to use my generator for an emergency. The wire comes in a plastic-wrapped roll with a couple bands around it. I'm used to Romex coming in the plastic roll that you can pull out of the middle, but this wasn't as easy as that. The wire is pliable, as I would expect 14 gauge wire to be, and it stripped well. I had to pull a number of lengths through flexible conduit and it was just stiff enough to push through without a fish tape if the conduit was straight. Overall, I give this wire high marks. I did not encounter any of it that had poor craftmanship, it works great for 15A circuits, and I haven't had an issue after using about 150 feet of it. I will order more and keep it on hand.",

Having an assortment of wire on hand helps ensure I'm using the right wire for the job both in function and appearance (color coding). This assortment includes 8 spools of silicone insulated 18AWG wire in different colors, along with heatshrink tubing and wire ties in matching colors which is a nice touch for neater, more professional looking wiring jobs. The spools are included in a box with holes to allow for dispensing, but the spools lay flat in the box -- not on edge like other boxes of dispensable wire I have. This isn't really an issue, just an odd choice and it makes the box a bit wider and flatter compared to a vertical orientation. Also included is a very basic wire stripper, though I don't use it as I have more capable wire strippers at hand. I would tend to challenge the specs/rating sheet included. Generally I wouldn't suggest anywhere near 22A be run through 18AWG wire. More like half that, tops. While the silicone insultation will help reduce the chance of fire from an over current situation compared to PVC or other materials, it will still get very hot and is a grossly inefficient application of power, with so much energy being lost as heat due to the resistance of the wire.

The outer PVC insulation is thick but flexible and has very little coil memory once straightened. The 22 AWG stranded copper conductors are nicely tinned, and flows solder nicely. Both the outer jacket and wire insulation are easily stripped with a quality tool and I did not experience any issues with broken conductors. The black/red/yellow conductors are convenient for many applications that have power/ground/control requirements within the 300V 2.2A rating. The -40℃ to + 80℃ temperature range also make it suitable for most DIY projects. The 22 AWG conductors are perfect for DuPont connectors, which are convenient for jumper wires, electronic projects, and testing."

The silicone is similar to what you find on a 2 carrier power wire but thicker. I'm using this for some 12vdc landscape lighting that's cut into my driveway and sealed with sikaflex with the rest trenched 12\" into my flower beds and then into my power supply. This is perfect for my application but could also be used for premium audio as well as 120vac.

        "Wiring a shed|||B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★★ [2023-06-21] <b>Good 14/2 wire for your home needs</b> I guess what most would want to know is how does it compare to what you get in a big box store given you probably haven't heard of this brand before. I got out some Southwire Romex and compared the two. This Arizona branded wire was nearly identical. The outer jacket was cut and pulled back and the wire stripped just as easily as the Romex. The only difference I really noticed was the outer jacket of the Romex felt more slick or slippery to the Arizona wire. It might matter a little bit if you are trying to pull it through 10 studs at once or so, but I don't think it would be a big difference. Overall, this wire seems to be right in line with the Romex. At the moment, this 100 ft roll is cheaper by about $20 than the 100 ft of Romex. I will say if you can bump up to the 250 ft roll, that is usually the best deal, but sometimes that is just overkill for your project and a smaller roll works out better. I would certainly have no issues using this wire for adding some lights or outlets and might use it to wire up my shed soon.",

I used this to wire up several outlets and did not have any issues at all. Standard 12/2 sheath strippers worked perfectly on the jacket, and pulling was just as easy as any other wire. I would use this again, however it will be a matter of price because there isn't much difference in this cable vs Romex or Cerro. Currently, this is more expensive than some other brands, I would like to see it priced a bit more competitively.",

I wasn't happy about the break, but the rest of the roll was able to be used elsewhere in the build to wire low-amp/load LED dusk-to-dawn coach-lamps on each side of my garage doors (so none was really wasted).

The stranding measures a little over 1mm diameter, so 16 gauge is also accurate. The wiring jacket says AWM on it, so this would be suitable for appliances needing a new plug (this is not SJOOW and shouldn't be used for extension cables). When I stripped the jacket back there was a weird white powder substance (I presume from manufacturing). I bought this to extend the cable length on a portable LED flood light and had no issues soldering this wire. I am unsure why the listing title says low voltage, given there is a ground wire, but I can only presume it's because it uses a red/black color for live and neutral opposed to the industry standard blue/white coloring.

The people who built my house put GFICI outlets on the back of the house around the pool area and time, and the second owners, have taken their toll on them. For whatever reason, so were taken out by ripping the plastic conduit off the boxes and the wires just cut off. How it ever passed home inspection is beyond me, but being the electrician that I am, I have been working on replacing them. Since I was already in the process, I decided to use this wire since it should cover the code requirements for the outlets. I pulled out the old wire from the subpanel (with the power off, off course). Being in Florida, the old wire was about 50 years old and crusty with the humidity and having had various creatures in there over the years. This wire was fully pliable at 14 gauge, and I had no issues pulling in through the bungs and watertight fittings I had added. I'm a fan of flexible conduit and 14 gauge is much easier to pull through it than 12, but make sure you know your local code requirements (or have a licensed electrician do the work) if you are doing this. I have wired three outlets with this wire and haven't found any issues with it. I found it to be easily workable, strips like I would expect it to, and didn't find any flaws in it. I can't see any fault with recommending this wire for your 14/2 wiring jobs."

Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again)."

It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone."

        "Carrying up to 15 amps<<<18 gauge wire|||B0BRN8DWTL ★★★★★ [2023-03-07] <b>Nice vintage wire for restorations and more</b> I originally got this to fix several lamps that I have been wanting to rewire and it's been great for that. One reviewer mentioned that the wires are not actually tinned; that is true. It's not a big deal when you are rewiring a lamp but it probably should be removed from the description. Once I rewired my lamps, I found that I love the vintage look of the wire so I decided to make some \"vintage\" extension cords using repro antique plugs and some new old stock surface mount receptacles. They look really cool, and they don't spoil the vintage look of my room and my lamps. Just remember that this is 18 gauge wire so you don't want it to be carrying more than 15 amps. Overall, I really like this wire and it's a simple way to keep that vintage look without having to use dangerous old wire. It's a great value and it does the job admirably."

This has 5 fifty foot rolls of 5 colors that should end the scrounging. This is a copper clad aluminum core (CCA) wire. The copper reduces corrosion caused by moisture and oxidation and adds surface conductivity. I got it to use for some small 12V wiring projects in the RV (additional 12 volt computer fan for gas refrigerator cooling) and to have on hand when I just need some short lengths of wire. For reference, Cu Clad Al (CCA) wire can be used for main wire projects but at a much larger gauge as aluminum has a higher resistance than copper. 12 AWG is recommended for a 15 Amp 110V circuit and 10 AWG for a 20 Amp. This is a 36 strand 16 AWG braided wire so it's not made for heavy loads or 110 volt wiring. Specs are for up to 80 volts. The wire is flexible and there's enough copper coating for it to solder easily to itself. If there's trouble having the wire stick, a copper infused solder works. I used some lead free Rosin Core 2.0 Sn99 Ag0.3 Cu0.7 electronics solder and everything was sucked into the wire and stuck together. I couldn't find the percent by weight of copper anywhere on the rolls, package, or website. The range for CCA is anywhere from 10% to 24% by weight, with the more the better (but also more expensive). 15 small zip ties and 10 heat shrink tubes are included in the box. I'm never going to use this on a main AC wiring project but for small electrical projects, it's a good economical choice and should last a long time. If you don't want 5 colors and a dispenser box, 4-color roll packages of 100'/roll 16AWG of this brand are the same price if you shop around. 4 stars - copper specs not given."

The sizes are all over the place depending on the gauge and number of wires and none of the sellers actually specify what size additional parts are needed to match up with it. As a side note, its also always confusing how sometimes it’ll state (for example) “6/3 wire” where you’d expect it to be three #6 wires total but in reality there are 4 wires, black, red, white and green. There isn’t always consistency in this, sure would be a lot easier if the standard was to count the actual number of wires, including the ground. This 6/3 MC cable in particular is actually four total 6 AWG wires, black, red, white, green for those that aren’t sure. It’s also rated for up to 55 Amps, which is perfect for wiring in a 50 amp RV, Dryer, or Oven outlet. Even if say your dryer outlet only requires 2 hots and a ground (6/2) with no neutral (old style), go ahead and run this (6/3) wire anyhow and just don’t use the extra wire, you’ll be doing yourself a future proof favor for the day when you replace that old appliance and discover the new one requires all 4 wires. Easier, and cheaper to just not use the extra wire now than trying to add another wire later."

The previous owner had an electrician go through the house and made copper pigtails with these wire nuts. 15 years later I have had multiple failures with these nuts. On any circuit that regularly has high current (toaster oven, washing machine, refrigerator, space heater) these nuts will heat up and melt. The way you discover that they are melting is you will either smell them or your circuit breaker will trip. The wall plate that my refrigerator was in became hot to the touch. Fortunately I never had a fire, but the damage caused by melting can be expensive if you need to rerun Romex because of melted wires. Look into AlumiConn as an alternative. I have only been using them for a few years, so far no issues but ask me again in 15 years."

In the Spring we discovered that several of the marker lights wouldn't light up due to power cables that were chewed through by sharp little teeth. The foxes have moved on but we were faced with repairing the broken cable. That's why I got this cable. It's perfect for low voltage outdoor use. The outside jacket is thick and robust.

When I stripped the two conductors, I noticed they are not tinned as stated in the product description. This may or may not be an issue for you.

This rugged construction ensures that the wire can handle the demands of various electrical applications, making it suitable for both professional and DIY projects. Despite its solid construction, the wire remains surprisingly flexible and soft. It easily bends and maneuvers around corners, allowing for convenient routing and installation. The flexibility of the wire is especially useful when working in tight spaces or when dealing with complex wiring configurations. Its softness adds to the ease of handling and makes it effortless to work with during installations. I primarily utilized this wire as a tool power cable, connecting power tools and equipment to a power source. Throughout my projects, the wire performed flawlessly, delivering a consistent and reliable power supply. I encountered no issues with power transmission or connectivity. The tinned copper construction of the wire ensures excellent conductivity, minimizing any potential voltage drops or interference, resulting in efficient and uninterrupted operation of my tools. Additionally, the 16-gauge thickness of the wire is well-suited for most power applications. It offers ample current-carrying capacity for typical household tools and equipment, providing a safe and stable power supply. The wire's length of 100 feet provides sufficient reach, allowing for flexible placement of tools and work areas without the need for additional extension cords."

        "Adding outlets to deck<<<Brittle wire|||B000W4EWEE ★★★☆☆ [2020-11-01] <b>Wire is a bit brittle, or I got a bad roll</b> I've used this brand wire before (12/2) to wire my garage, and was quite pleased, so I thought I'd give this a shot to add a couple of outlets to my deck. I've ran 14-ga wire many times, and this wire is the correct thickness solid-core, and came in the correct length, BUT, this roll was bit brittle. I had one section that required a 90-deg bend under my deck... the neutral wire broke inside the sheathing, which caused me to have to trash that section and re-run it with a different brand/manufacturer wire I had. I wasn't happy about the break, but the rest of the roll was able to be used elsewhere in the build to wire low-amp/load LED dusk-to-dawn coach-lamps on each side of my garage doors (so none was really wasted). Maybe the break was just a factory-defect? Still, though, I will not likely buy this brand of 14-ga wire again, unless it is all that is available."

        "Use with vampire plugs|||B083DKW6DG ★★★★★ [2020-10-19] <b>Take it from a computerized Christmas light show guy, BUY THIS</b> I have been using spt-1 wire for several years here in Florida for my Christmas and Halloween light shows. This wire is easy to use, store and affordable enough to keep a 1000' roll on hand for last minute add on projects. anyone that does Holiday lighting as a hobby already knows there are always last minute projects in the rule of thumb is have two of everything on hand even if you only need one. I'm at around 6,000 feet worth of spt-1 wire right now and probably 1200 total vampire plugs. So much easier to cut to length and use vampire plugs on it rather than those heavy store bought extension cords. One trick I have learned is to get a silver paint marker and write on the slide on plugs what the wire controls This helps both for storage as well as set up next year. This wire has saved my back because it is lightweight and not heavy for storage. I can store 3,000 ft worth of this wire with plugs on it in a tote versus only being able to put in 9 of the 100 ft extension cords from the stores back in the old days. Plus the green color hides well even during the daylight hours. The polarized wire is ribbed so it's easy to make sure when you're putting on plugs they are all going in the proper direction. It's up to us Holiday Fanatics to light up the world. You won't be disappointed. In northern states you may want to use spt to due to the freezing weather. But in Florida spt one works perfectly fine. -GriswoldStyle LOR",

The conductors are fine stranded, tinned copper, which is a thin protective coating on the copper to keep it from corroding in harsh environments such as ocean areas, or auto applications where winter road salting can cause problems. Despite what other reviewers have said, this is indeed copper wire, but the “tinning” process makes the wire appear silver unless you look at the cut end. It is typically used with crimp connectors in most applications. There is no indication that this wire is UL listed, so I would not use it for home-wiring applications or any 120 volt (or higher) AC current. The silicone insulation and fine stranding make this wire very flexible, so perfect for sharp turns and pulling through tight locations like behind the dash. The 14 gauge that I used is good for any circuits of up to 10 amps unless they are longer than 25 feet or so. Remember to calculate for both positive and negative lengths, and whether you can afford any voltage drop in your circuit. Circuits for an automotive refrigerator or fog lamps, which have extended use times for example, are different than a circuit for a horn, which is only used for a couple seconds at a time. This seems to be a very good quality and well manufactured wire, and is available in a wide variety of gauges, both red and black."

There are two mid pieces that contain a rubber sleeve. Two size sleeves are provided: 5mm and 12mm. They are squeezed by tightening the end caps to form a watertight seal on the exterior wire jacket. Note that the description of 5-12mm wire size refers to this outer cable jacket. The mid pieces screw together over the center section which contains the wire splicing block. It appears that up to 16 gauge wire could be used. Each wire is placed in a ferrule and is captured by a screw that is tightened such that the wire is pushed into the ferrule body, which contains a similar screw arrangement on the other side allowing two wires to be spliced/connected. The mid pieces screw over the center section and the joint is made waterproof by an o-ring on each side. They claim IP68, which means that the connection should not be continuously kept underwater. I tested the connector under a running faucet for 5 minutes and no water got inside. It should be fine in any rainstorm. I would not place it where it could be exposed to strong streams of water, such as in a pressure washer. The rating of 24A means no more than 6A per contact. If you use this for more than 50V, I would make sure that all strands on the wire are inside the ferrule and that the wire insulation goes right up to the ferrule to minimize creapage paths for high voltage. Overall, this is a very effective and compact way of splicing wires that will be exposed to weather. These were installed on the control cables of an amateur radio antenna system.

Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again)."

No fault to the seller or product, Amazon had the “order this + this + this” option for the end connectors and clamps, which you’ll also need, but it gives you a wrong size for the end clamps. The 3/4” mounting straps are the right size, but 3/4” ends to secure this 6/3 MC cable to your metal boxes is way to big. I ended up having to make a trip to the hardware store to buy smaller 1/2” end clamps instead of the 3/4” ones Amazon was recommending. I love working with MC cable, but its always a pain trying to determine the correct size anti short bushings, end caps, mounting straps etc to go with it. The sizes are all over the place depending on the gauge and number of wires and none of the sellers actually specify what size additional parts are needed to match up with it. As a side note, its also always confusing how sometimes it’ll state (for example) “6/3 wire” where you’d expect it to be three #6 wires total but in reality there are 4 wires, black, red, white and green. There isn’t always consistency in this, sure would be a lot easier if the standard was to count the actual number of wires, including the ground. This 6/3 MC cable in particular is actually four total 6 AWG wires, black, red, white, green for those that aren’t sure. It’s also rated for up to 55 Amps, which is perfect for wiring in a 50 amp RV, Dryer, or Oven outlet. Even if say your dryer outlet only requires 2 hots and a ground (6/2) with no neutral (old style), go ahead and run this (6/3) wire anyhow and just don’t use the extra wire, you’ll be doing yourself a future proof favor for the day when you replace that old appliance and discover the new one requires all 4 wires. Easier, and cheaper to just not use the extra wire now than trying to add another wire later.",

The wire is stiff and difficult to work with but that's just the way it is with 6 gauge wire. No complaints at all. My only issue isn't the cable itself but the two other items under the \"frequently bought together\" heading. One of those items is a 3/4\" squeeze connector. That connector does NOT fit this cable (ask me how I know). You need 1/2\" hardware not 3/4\" for this cable. It seems like a massive 6/3 + ground cable like this would want 3/4\" hardware but that's not the case. I bought 1/2\" squeeze connectors and right angle connectors at Home Depot and they did fit. The other item under \"frequently bought together\", the cable strap, is probably the wrong size as well but I didn't buy that item so I don't know for sure. Anyway, don't hesitate to buy this cable if you need 50 amps. It'll do the job just fine."

        "Color-coding different circuits<<<Eight different colors|||B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ [2024-04-12] <b>Great Hookup Wire Kit</b> This 18 Gauge Wire Kit from LEDLampsWorld is a really nice assortment of wire for all sorts of projects that home handypersons, hobbyists, inventors, makers, electronics students, etc. would find very useful. I myself got the kit because although I have lots of wire in my workshop, most of it is \"reused\" wire from otherwise discarded items, and I don't really have an assortment of colors available to color-code different circuits (which gives a nice neat appearance plus makes it easier to understand the function of different circuits if/when maintenance on them is required up the road). There are a total of eight different colors in this kit, which includes the commonly-used red, black, green, white and yellow. The quality of the wire is really good, with soft and very flexible insulation that's easy to strip, and tinned copper that won't tarnish and potentially cause issues in the future when being soldered. There are some nice bonuses included in the package as well, which although they are mentioned in the product ad I somehow failed to notice until the box arrived and I had a nice surprise. These is a selection of heat shrink tubing and plastic wire ties that match each of the 8 colors of wire. Also included is a little stripping tool. Although I already have a few wire strippers of various designs, I wanted to try the included one to see how it worked, and was pleased with the results - it stripped the insulation from the wire without cutting through any of the conductors. Very nice!",

I'm restoring an older classic '67 GTO and making a few changes on a custom bike I built long ago. This set of '6' various color spools arrived in good time and in its own 'stronger' cardboard 'reusable' box. Upon giving a bit of this stuff a 'go test' on re-wiriing new horns on that ol' relic and the same for a new honker on the bike - this stuff worked out better than the stuff I'm used to from a few spools lying around here. U can tell the immediate difference in the flexibility of the sheathing. Like comparing thick racing engine plug wire to the cheap thin stuff. As for any soldering - stuffs great thou higher bond point u can tell its stronger. Any splices r handled with some new solder joint connectors I just happened to snatch up and this stuff worked great in those too. I did find that there is the slight possiblity of tearing open the silicone jacket of this stuff 'easier' over other types due to having easier stripping ability so yankin' on this stuff when routing any wire runs needs to b given some added care to avoid snags on anything sharp. Otherwise some great wire here and worth the lil xtra bidenbux for an overall better quality product."

I bought this pack primarily for one cable to use in my car. I have a car charger that has 2 USB-C outputs. One is higher powered than the other. The high power one has a red cable and i wanted a different cable to differentiate the lower power output so blue worked for me. Again, the thickness of the cable (which doesn't really have any effect on it's flexibility) helps me locate this particular one in the dark of my car without having to turn on the lights. I also liked that there's a cable tie included with each cable making storage in my car's center console nice and neat. Since this came with two cables, I used the other one at my desk in my office to charge my phone. I have a Samsung wireless charging pad and this fits perfectly. It doesn't charge too fast, though, so if i need a quick charge or if i want to charge while i use my phone, i can unplug the charging pad and plug directly into my phone for a high powered fast charge.

So, this wire will fail any electrical inspection for permitting that follows the NEC. And for those who might be considering using this wire for an EV charging outlet with 32A or 40A continuous current, I would be very concerned about heat dissipation. The NEC fill chart ensures there's enough space around the wires for adequate heat dissipation. Overcrowded conduits can lead to overheating. Furthermore, there are no UL listing markings on this cable to ensure adequate testing and safe operation, and jamming 4 conductors of this size into 1/2\" metal conduit risks damaging the wire insulation, potentially leading to short circuits and electrical fires. Buyer beware."

        "12v actuated valve<<<14 gauge wire|||B092JB7VD2 ★★★★★ [2021-09-23] <b>Well made</b> So I used this for multiple lighting runs. It's 14 gauge so that's more than enough. If you look at the wire gauge chart you can use 100 watts of lights if it's 40 feet or less. Shorter than 40 feet the carrying capacity goes up more, so this is perfect for me. I ran 12v LED Headlights and tail lights on my golf cart. I ran a 12v actuated valve on this wire. I have plans for landscape lighting but am playing with solar lights at the moment so I may never get there. Funny that the one thing it is really intended for I may never use it for! I'm sure I'll have a stereo install in the future for my son and this can work for speaker wire too. Lots of low voltage uses. The longest run I've done so far was for the 12v actuated valve, about 20', and I used maybe 10' on the golf cart. So I have plenty left over for whatever the next project is."

        "Repairing travel trailer light wiring|||B00P1UENB6 ★★★☆☆ [2021-02-17] <b>Waterproof but not the easiest to use</b> I needed to repair some wiring on the lights of my travel trailer. These connectors were already in use and they seemed like a good replacement for when I ran new wiring. They seem like they would protect well against moisture. However, it seems if you pre-strip the wires they do not give a very good connection. I had to cut off a couple of the new ones I installed and reapply because of flaky connections (they cannot be res-used). It's a good job they come in a bag of 50! They are not that easy to use either since the sleeves to hold the wires in place are quite short."

I was able to run most of it underground, so it stays hidden very well. Music quality sounds great and I have no complaints. 14 ga. wire is perfect for my application. The wire is CCA which means it is aluminum wire covered in copper with copper being the better conductor. That is fine with me, as pure 14 ga. copper would probably be 3x as expensive.

The gauge is correct (I measured it with a wire gauge tool). The wire retains a little memory, so if you kink it, it will unkink on its own, but you'll be left with a mark from where the tight kink used to be, unless you make an effort to smooth it out again, which it does nicely. The silicone insulation is highly heat resistant. I took a torch lighter to it and applied a direct flame for several seconds. The insulation held up well. The only indication it had been torched was that the insulation lost its color and turned white, but the structure of the insulation itself was undamaged. Very cool stuff for high temperature applications. I might try some of this for winding some transformer coils (BALUNS) for ham radio, though it might be a little tricky to keep it holding its shape. This wire is better suited in applications like probe leads and jumper wires (with alligator clips at each end for example, for diagnostic work in a hot engine compartment, or for splicing a line where that line may end up in contact with a source of heat). The insulation is tough stuff. It does not pinch easily, but strips nicely. In appearance it looks like fine stainless steel but a hint of copper color under the light is visible in a cleanly cut end and it solders well, so although I am not a chemist, I would say it's a safe bet that this is in fact, tinned copper. You get a number of small spools in a nice assortment of colors. The spools have predrilled holes in the flanges so you can keep the spool from unwinding."

Besides being the perfect size, this kit does have everything you would need to do any kind of electrical work (minus any electrical wiring). I can see using this for re-wiring my garage, working my car, and if I had a boat, working on a boat. I can also see using this on small engines, like lawnmowers. What's also really nice bout this kit is everything is labeled. Each box has a label on it telling you exactly what is in it. It is really easy to find what you need. A last nice thing about this kit is the bag that the tools come in. Very convenient. It's definitely a pricey item, but it's worth the money if you do a lot of electrical work.

I twisted the strands and crimped 16 ga. connectors. The twisted wires fit the connectors and crimped properly. I could not pull the connection apart. It would have been nice to have had a hole in the spool to keep the wire from de-reeling, but an 11/64 drill bit took care of that. The seller specs the current rating at 20 amps-600 volts AC. 16 ga. wire in 12VDC applications ranges from 8 to 10 amps depending on length, and 13 amps in AC applications."

        "Campers<<<Very flexible wire|||B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ [2023-02-13] <b>Great quality automotive & marine wire</b> This is perfect wire for automotive use, including campers and marine applications. The conductors are fine stranded, tinned copper, which is a thin protective coating on the copper to keep it from corroding in harsh environments such as ocean areas, or auto applications where winter road salting can cause problems. Despite what other reviewers have said, this is indeed copper wire, but the “tinning” process makes the wire appear silver unless you look at the cut end. It is typically used with crimp connectors in most applications. There is no indication that this wire is UL listed, so I would not use it for home-wiring applications or any 120 volt (or higher) AC current. The silicone insulation and fine stranding make this wire very flexible, so perfect for sharp turns and pulling through tight locations like behind the dash. The 14 gauge that I used is good for any circuits of up to 10 amps unless they are longer than 25 feet or so. Remember to calculate for both positive and negative lengths, and whether you can afford any voltage drop in your circuit. Circuits for an automotive refrigerator or fog lamps, which have extended use times for example, are different than a circuit for a horn, which is only used for a couple seconds at a time. This seems to be a very good quality and well manufactured wire, and is available in a wide variety of gauges, both red and black."

Looking out at the green and the shade that those trees provide is a great feeling. But why enjoy them only during the day. A good set of landscaping lights make all the difference in my yard at night. The easiest option to do this are the ever popular solar lights that you just pop into the ground and the just work. Unfortunately, those can get expensive and the batteries in them are usually still NiCad, which will lose their charge after just a few months. Wiring your own lights isn't difficult. This Elite 16/2 Landscape Lighting Wire provides low voltage copper wires in an outdoor-rated, weather resistant coating that can be buried without additional conduits. The pricing for this product is reasonable there really isn't much to complain about. The wire itself is somewhat stiff but it really is like working with the drip irrigation pipes. Just lay out the wire, tack it in place and connect the lights. This product works as you would expect and very durable, these wires have been in ground for over 6 months and they're still working great, no issues at all.."

        "outdoor lighting<<<thick outer insulation|||B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ [2023-12-27] <b>Outer insulation is THICK!</b> I tried this for an outside, low-voltage lighting application, with the wire buried. It seems to be working well, but I'll need to come back in a year or so, to see how it's holing up. One thing I did notice is that the outer insulation is VERY thick. I suppose this is good and bad. (Probably mostly good.) What's bad is that it was too thick to work with my standard wire stripping took, so I needed to remove the outer insulation by hand, using a razor blade. The thickness of the insulation, and the fact that it's not a uniform thickness all around (see photo), made it hard to cut off the outer insulation without nicking the inner insulation on the individual conductors. The GOOD aspect is that the extra-thick outer insulation will likely protect the conductors from being crushed or otherwise damaged during use. (An extra-thick outer layer of insulation could come in especially handy for outdoor buried applications, to protect against a spade or small shovel , for example, when planting flowers.) So far, I am pleased with this product!",
        "outdoor lighting<<<thick outer insulation|||B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ [2023-12-30] <b>Easy to work with</b> This wire is easy to work with. I’ve used it in the past for multiple projects. The project I used it for this time was to install 10 lights that are sunk into the ground. I installed glass lights in the ground and the wire is very easy to connect the vampire clips to and get a good connection. It is flexible enough to go around bushes and boulders if needed. When it comes to slicing into the wire to make the connection, it’s very easy to use just a simple razor blade and get the wires spread apart. My recommendation is to lay out all of the wiring and the lights above ground make all of your connections and taps into the wire, and then make sure everything is working before you start to bury the cable and the lights. All in all very simple wire to use and I would recommended it for any landscape project."

This type of wire is specifically designed for use with low voltage lighting systems and provides a safe and reliable connection for your lights. One of the best things about low voltage landscape wire is its durability. This wire is well-insulated and resistant to weather and moisture, ensuring long-lasting performance in even the harshest outdoor conditions. It is also easy to work with, making it a great choice for DIYers and professionals alike. In addition to its practical benefits, low voltage landscape wire is also very cost-effective. Because it uses less energy than traditional outdoor wiring, it can save you money on your electricity bill over time. And because it is safe to use in wet conditions, you won’t have to worry about costly repairs or replacements due to water damage. Overall, I highly recommend low voltage landscape wire to anyone planning an outdoor lighting project.

Stiffer in a colder outdoor environment. I did not measure the length to confirm advertised 165 ft though. Conductor appears to be pure copper strands, which is as claimed, not copper coated aluminum. The individual strands are quite fine. I counted 64 strands after stripping. Makes it very flexible and not likely to break after many and extreme bends. See photo. - Was easy to strip. - Actually the product seems fairly generic: there is no branding printed on the jacket nor any identification label on the roll. But you weren't expecting a mainstream brand anyhow, and it's just outdoor low voltage wire. It's fine. Looks like it will hold up in the garden. - One thing to keep in mind is that because it's bare copper wire (not tined, like marine wire) the connections are subject to corrosion from moisture and humidity. Make sure to use a connector method that either bonds the ends (solder) or creates a waterproof barrier to prevent this. - At the time I ordered the 16/2 165ft roll was $41, making it an okay deal, considering it's generic wire. - Hope this helps",

The cords are permanently attached to the panels and cannot be replaced, so I didn't want them exposed constantly to sunlight and weather. So I ordered a 10' roll of the 3/8th\" tubing. I measure out how much cable length I'd need plus a little slack, then I wrapped the excess around one or both of the panel/camera mounts (depending on how much unused cable length there'd be) and wrapped self-bonding silicone tape around the cable to secure/waterproof/protect it. Then I cut an appropriate length of the split tubing and slipped it over the exposed cable between the two, then for some cameras where necessary I cut a smaller piece or two and added them to the small amount of slack I left after the wrapping. Where appropriate I wrapped a small amount of the silicone tape on the ends to keep it in place/further waterproof it. This gives a clean, finished, and professional look. I was impressed with the results so much I've ordered more additional cameras, as well as to help reorganize some computer cable routing.

I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful."

There are two mid pieces that contain a rubber sleeve. Two size sleeves are provided: 5mm and 12mm. They are squeezed by tightening the end caps to form a watertight seal on the exterior wire jacket. Note that the description of 5-12mm wire size refers to this outer cable jacket. The mid pieces screw together over the center section which contains the wire splicing block. It appears that up to 16 gauge wire could be used. Each wire is placed in a ferrule and is captured by a screw that is tightened such that the wire is pushed into the ferrule body, which contains a similar screw arrangement on the other side allowing two wires to be spliced/connected. The mid pieces screw over the center section and the joint is made waterproof by an o-ring on each side. They claim IP68, which means that the connection should not be continuously kept underwater. I tested the connector under a running faucet for 5 minutes and no water got inside. It should be fine in any rainstorm. I would not place it where it could be exposed to strong streams of water, such as in a pressure washer. The rating of 24A means no more than 6A per contact. If you use this for more than 50V, I would make sure that all strands on the wire are inside the ferrule and that the wire insulation goes right up to the ferrule to minimize creapage paths for high voltage. Overall, this is a very effective and compact way of splicing wires that will be exposed to weather. These were installed on the control cables of an amateur radio antenna system. I like their design and will buy more when the need arises."

My previous counterpoise was regular insulated copper wire and it became a pain keeping it straight, as to store the 19.5\" wire when not in use you wrap it around the HT. When unwrapping it the wire would retain the bends and would not hang straight down as you want. Trying to smooth it out and remove the bends was pretty much pointless, and it would want to keep curling back. Then when you stowed your HT, it would happen again when you pulled it out again and unwound it. I saw a recommendation to use silicone-insulated wire as it was much more flexible. I gave it a shot, and it is indeed much better for this purpose. The wire retains a little bit of memory when you unwind it, but a few smoothing passes of your hand down it gets it pretty straight, and it will \"loosen up\" even more over time. I get better performance out of this compared to my prior counterpoise, but that could be the result of intentionally going down a wire gauge to a thicker wire, the line staying straighter, the increased number of strands inside compared to the previous wire, the difference in connecting (soldering a wire loop versus using a terminal ring) or a combination of all four.",

        "Power cables for ham radio transceivers<<<Copper wire|||B0BYNNJS8B ★★★★★ [2023-11-04] <b>Good Quality, High Temp Wire</b> I work on a lot of electronics requiring 12-gauge wire and recently procured this wire for a couple of my projects. I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful."

My previous counterpoise was regular insulated copper wire and it became a pain keeping it straight, as to store the 19.5\" wire when not in use you wrap it around the HT. When unwrapping it the wire would retain the bends and would not hang straight down as you want. Trying to smooth it out and remove the bends was pretty much pointless, and it would want to keep curling back. Then when you stowed your HT, it would happen again when you pulled it out again and unwound it. I saw a recommendation to use silicone-insulated wire as it was much more flexible. I gave it a shot, and it is indeed much better for this purpose. The wire retains a little bit of memory when you unwind it, but a few smoothing passes of your hand down it gets it pretty straight, and it will \"loosen up\" even more over time. I get better performance out of this compared to my prior counterpoise, but that could be the result of intentionally going down a wire gauge to a thicker wire, the line staying straighter, the increased number of strands inside compared to the previous wire, the difference in connecting (soldering a wire loop versus using a terminal ring) or a combination of all four.",

It's great stuff with an incredibly durable and UV resistant insulation. Every time I pull my antennas down to make changes or just inspect it, the wire looks absolutely new. It stands up to windstorms as well as it's got enough stretch to not break when stressed. The gray and light blue colors blend nicely into the sky, so my antennas are quite stealthy.

My previous counterpoise was regular insulated copper wire and it became a pain keeping it straight, as to store the 19.5\" wire when not in use you wrap it around the HT. When unwrapping it the wire would retain the bends and would not hang straight down as you want. Trying to smooth it out and remove the bends was pretty much pointless, and it would want to keep curling back. Then when you stowed your HT, it would happen again when you pulled it out again and unwound it. I saw a recommendation to use silicone-insulated wire as it was much more flexible. I gave it a shot, and it is indeed much better for this purpose. The wire retains a little bit of memory when you unwind it, but a few smoothing passes of your hand down it gets it pretty straight, and it will \"loosen up\" even more over time. I get better performance out of this compared to my prior counterpoise, but that could be the result of intentionally going down a wire gauge to a thicker wire, the line staying straighter, the increased number of strands inside compared to the previous wire, the difference in connecting (soldering a wire loop versus using a terminal ring) or a combination of all four."

This wire works great for that and the variety of colors and gauges it comes in is a bonus. I've used several different gauges and colors and they have all worked well.

        "Power cables for ham radio transceivers<<<Silicone insulated|||B0BYNNJS8B ★★★★★ [2023-11-04] <b>Good Quality, High Temp Wire</b> I work on a lot of electronics requiring 12-gauge wire and recently procured this wire for a couple of my projects. I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful."

        "Winding transformer coils (BALUNS) for ham radio<<<Retains slight memory after kinking|||B0C7T9YK2N ★★★★☆ [2023-10-24] <b>Supple yet strong, low-memory</b> As far as I can tell, this is some good wire. The gauge is correct (I measured it with a wire gauge tool). The wire retains a little memory, so if you kink it, it will unkink on its own, but you'll be left with a mark from where the tight kink used to be, unless you make an effort to smooth it out again, which it does nicely. The silicone insulation is highly heat resistant. I took a torch lighter to it and applied a direct flame for several seconds. The insulation held up well. The only indication it had been torched was that the insulation lost its color and turned white, but the structure of the insulation itself was undamaged. Very cool stuff for high temperature applications. I might try some of this for winding some transformer coils (BALUNS) for ham radio, though it might be a little tricky to keep it holding its shape. This wire is better suited in applications like probe leads and jumper wires (with alligator clips at each end for example, for diagnostic work in a hot engine compartment, or for splicing a line where that line may end up in contact with a source of heat). The insulation is tough stuff. It does not pinch easily, but strips nicely. In appearance it looks like fine stainless steel but a hint of copper color under the light is visible in a cleanly cut end and it solders well, so although I am not a chemist, I would say it's a safe bet that this is in fact, tinned copper. You get a number of small spools in a nice assortment of colors. The spools have predrilled holes in the flanges so you can keep the spool from unwinding."

I had bought 2 packs :'-( The ones that I did use were excellent! I had to splice (3) 10G wires and (1) 18G wire together near a small goldfish pond (read, moist soil), and this fit perfectly and screwed on nice and tight. The caulk on the inside sealed them up perfectly, so even after burying them in the wet soil there was no voltage drop. As others said, the caulk is SUPER sticky!! After I screwed each one on, though, I picked up some dirt and rubbed it in to my hands; that worked fine to remove the stickiness, and washed off later with no problem. I kind of think that I could have saved some money by using regular wire nuts and just squirting silicone caulk in it before screwing in the wire, but I'm not positive it would have been the same. These were good for the job, though, I just wish that I would have realized that I had overpurchased earlier so I could at least return one of the packs.",

I use 14/2 cable in my landscape lighting for the final connections to groups of LED fixtures. I use 12/2 for distribution over long distances to get to the clusters of fixtures. 14/2 works great in that application and helps to save a little money compared to running 12/2 everywhere. If your cable runs are all short and you have a modest number of LED fixtures then 14/2 may be good enough for the entire system. Note that 14/2 cable has a lower current rating than 12/2 cable, which is counterintuitive given the numbers are getting smaller as ampacity increases. So if you've got really long cable runs you'll probably want to use the 12/2 instead."

This product really saved the day in this situation! As you can see in the attached picture, I was able to wire each of the lights in sequence without any issues. A few specific thoughts: - These wire nuts contain the exact right amount of silicone to make them waterproof without causing the silicone to run all over the wires. Some comparable products are \"over-filled\" with silicone and it squirts out and makes a mess of everything (including your hands). - The bright blue color stands out really well against dirt, leaves, etc., making the wire connections easy to spot even when working in low light. - Every single wire nut gripped the wires tightly and held them firmly.

The lights are only a few feet apart in a long flower bed, and I didn’t want to cut this wire into many short segments to use wire nuts at each light. So I tried the new Malibu Low Voltage Cable Connectors that pierce the insulation from both sides. They work perfectly, and have the advantage that the wire doesn’t have to be split apart every few feet to use an alternate piercing connector. Bottom line, this is great wire, with real copper conductors and flexible insulation that is easy to work with. It just isn't compatible with crimp connectors that expect the conductors to have the same spacing as in old 12 gauge landscape wire.",

The wire insulation is black so it will withstand the elements well. It's a 100 foot roll to make sure you don't come up short. The strands are pretty stiff and should crumple when you slide them into connectors and it's solid copper so it will solder well. Cons: None from me.",

This product really saved the day in this situation! As you can see in the attached picture, I was able to wire each of the lights in sequence without any issues. A few specific thoughts: - These wire nuts contain the exact right amount of silicone to make them waterproof without causing the silicone to run all over the wires. Some comparable products are \"over-filled\" with silicone and it squirts out and makes a mess of everything (including your hands). - The bright blue color stands out really well against dirt, leaves, etc., making the wire connections easy to spot even when working in low light. - Every single wire nut gripped the wires tightly and held them firmly. I HIGHLY recommend always giving the wires a gentle tug after tightening a wire nut just to be sure that they will not slip out over time."

It is also color-coded for easy identification and installation, which made the process of setting up my outdoor lighting system a breeze. The 50-foot length is more than enough for most outdoor projects, and the low voltage rating ensures that it is safe to use around plants and other outdoor features. This wire is ideal for use with low voltage LED lighting systems, which are becoming increasingly popular for their energy efficiency and ease of use. This cable works great with waterproof connectors, or waterproof wire nuts. Overall, I highly recommend the UBOORY 16/2 Low Voltage Landscape Wire to anyone who is in need of a reliable and high-quality wire for their outdoor electrical needs. It is easy to work with, durable, and provides excellent performance. It has definitely been a great addition to my outdoor lighting system, and I'm sure it will be for you too!",

Used this to run any split leg off of main run (12 gauge) and had no issues with any lights. Total main run was <100 ft. Each leg run was <40 ft. Coupling was done with wire nuts filled with silicone to waterproof and limit corrosion.",

This product really saved the day in this situation! As you can see in the attached picture, I was able to wire each of the lights in sequence without any issues. A few specific thoughts: - These wire nuts contain the exact right amount of silicone to make them waterproof without causing the silicone to run all over the wires. Some comparable products are \"over-filled\" with silicone and it squirts out and makes a mess of everything (including your hands). - The bright blue color stands out really well against dirt, leaves, etc., making the wire connections easy to spot even when working in low light. - Every single wire nut gripped the wires tightly and held them firmly. I HIGHLY recommend always giving the wires a gentle tug after tightening a wire nut just to be sure that they will not slip out over time."

The cable is of the advertised gauge, verified with a gauge checker.

This product really saved the day in this situation! As you can see in the attached picture, I was able to wire each of the lights in sequence without any issues. A few specific thoughts: - These wire nuts contain the exact right amount of silicone to make them waterproof without causing the silicone to run all over the wires. Some comparable products are \"over-filled\" with silicone and it squirts out and makes a mess of everything (including your hands). - The bright blue color stands out really well against dirt, leaves, etc., making the wire connections easy to spot even when working in low light. - Every single wire nut gripped the wires tightly and held them firmly.

        "Landscape lighting<<<Rated for use with voltages up to 300V|||B0CSD35PQT ★★★★☆ [2024-03-05] <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone."

I use 14/2 cable in my landscape lighting for the final connections to groups of LED fixtures. I use 12/2 for distribution over long distances to get to the clusters of fixtures. 14/2 works great in that application and helps to save a little money compared to running 12/2 everywhere. If your cable runs are all short and you have a modest number of LED fixtures then 14/2 may be good enough for the entire system. Note that 14/2 cable has a lower current rating than 12/2 cable, which is counterintuitive given the numbers are getting smaller as ampacity increases. So if you've got really long cable runs you'll probably want to use the 12/2 instead."

        "Landscape lighting<<<Outer jacket fills with water in damp climates|||B07MCF1BMP ★★★☆☆ [2022-12-27] <b>A very strange product. I would take 'outdoor rated' with a grain of salt</b> TL;DR version: If you intend to use this cable in an outdoor environment, I would look elsewhere. I have used several spools of this company's 3 conductor wire for various projects and it has worked out well. The conductors are not undersized, and the outer cable sheath is properly tough. So I decided to give their 2 conductor wire a try. It turned out to be a very oddly constructed 2 conductor cable. My biggest issue is that the outer protective layer is MUCH bigger than required. It is literally the same outer sheath size as the 3 conductor cable I have used often - it literally appears that they just pulled one conductor out of their 3 conductor cable, put it on a reel, and sold it. This is not great for a couple of reasons: 1) The cable is thicker than it needs to be (not space efficient), so anyone working with limited space for their wire runs, or wire runs that are visible (like low voltage outdoor LED lighting), may want to look elsewhere. 2) This stuff says it is outdoor rated. However it is outdoor rated for UV exposure only. Because there is so much empty space within the outer jacket, anyone wanting to use this outdoors in damp climates or around water (irrigation wiring, landscape lighting, etc) should realize that the outer jacket is going to rapidly fill up with water (and stay filled), causing several types of issues: - Electric issues: any minor wire scrapes or damage could result in hard-to-trace shorts or random voltage drops. - Extra water weight: The extra weight all of that water filling up the PVC jacket could be significant. I intended to use this cable for outdoor permanent installations of LED light strings, hung or mounted in various ways on my house and in landscaping. I live in a wet climate, and after a few months of rainy fall/winter/spring weather I estimate that the added weight of all that water filling up the empty space within the cable jacket would more than double the total weight of the cable runs. With a couple hundred feet of cable, that weight will add up pretty quickly. - Water damage: Depending on how/where your cabling is routed, you could essentially be installing a de-facto water pipe that will shunt rain and/or irrigation water through the excess space within the outer jacket and into areas of your walls/house that would otherwise have remained perfectly dry. A potential recipe for serious hidden water damage. I ended up returning this and buying a different product elsewhere."

Almost immediately, with just a little bit of resistance placed on the wire as it was put into the junction box, the wires starting dislodging from the connector. Tried a second connector, has the same problem. Tried a third connector, and found that it took minimal effort to pull the #12 wire out of the connector. I have used other brands in other applications, and it was almost impossible to remove the wires, once inserted. This product did not have the same lock effect. I would be uncomfortable using this product in any 120V application, due to the potential for the connection to fail causing a short."

Things that you often would use your stepladder to do can be done by these and thus free up the use of your ladder for what it is intended. It is sturdy enough to work hard but not so expensive that you worry about leaving overnight at a site. You will probably end up doing some customizing, such as with the two metal pins that join the sections to make a stand, I drilled them in the center and put a monofilament line on them to tether them to a handle so they do not get lost. I also put some screws through the base into the sub-floor when I am pulling stiff cable to keep it from sliding. Overall, the slots and shaping make this a very helpful temporary rig. On the home/farm front, it can readily be used on a bench for multiple reel cable dispensing.",

        "tool rack|||B0CL4QNJKB ★★★★☆ [2024-04-15] <b>Awesome, with a couple minor flaws.</b> I love these things. One minute, they're a wire spool rack. The next, they're work bench. Then, they're a set of saw horses, or a table, or a seat, or a pipe vice, or tool rack, or .... They serve tons of different functions on a job site -- or even around the home and shop. They are very thick and sturdy, and are stable in all of the different configurations they're designed for. I have just two little nits about these: 1. There are two small steel bars that act as connecting pegs, to hold the two plates together vertically. They don't get used often, so there's a very good chance they'll get lost. There are a couple of indented areas on each plate that look like the bars should be stored in; but the bars just fall out. There's nothing to hold them in. With all of the careful, thoughtful, designing that went into this system; I'm amazed this wasn't dealt with. 2. The two halves clip together nicely, but there's no good way to store them. The assembly is still very bulky and awkward, even after disassembling it and clipping the two halves together -- and they will fall apart if you try to hang them up. Bottom line: A couple of little issues that should be considered; but still an amazingly useful product.",

        "Organization tool|||B0CL4QNJKB ★★★★☆ [2024-01-31] <b>Super tough</b> As a ham radio hobbyist, I always have several spools of wire sitting around. You never know when you'll need to make a new antenna or put together an electronics kit. Normally my spools just sit on the shelf but now I can stay better organized and spool the length of wire out that I need easier. I was a little surprised at just how durable this stand is. The plastic is really thick. As in the description, you need to provide your own rods and can configure the setup based on the number and size of spools that you have. I don't personally get the purpose for the other uses for this device that are listed in the sales description. They say you can use it as a table, a chair, and half dozen other things. If you need a table, buy a table. If you need a chair, buy a chair. Yes, they do have it where this could work in a pinch, but I can't imagine anyone buying it for those purposes. It would be sub-optimal at best for any of the use cases aside from the wire spool holder. So, to the downside of this thing. The manufacturer should work on the packaging better. The instructions say it comes with two little pins for use in table mode. They don't exist for me. I did find a small plastic bag attached by tape to the device. The bag was empty. I'm assuming they were in that. Again, I don't expect to put it in table mode so not a big loss. The next thing affects me a little more. There are four rubber feet on each end, 8 in total. These are to keep it level and provide some cushioning. As received, mine has 5 of these rubber feet, missing 3 of them. To have the thing level, I’ll have to remove the remaining feet. The entire package is the two plastic pieces zip tied together, with the plastic bag taped to the side. The only packaging on top of that is a thin piece of cardboard printed with the logo and instructions sandwiched in to hold it. There is no protection for the feet, which are only glued on and can easily fall off. There is no protection for the plastic bag which is very likely to rip and have lost pieces before it gets to you. Personally, I'm still satisfied overall with this device. I'll just be going to the hardware store to find some rubber furniture feet for it myself.",

The only comment I can make about it that may be a negative factor for some is that the cord is round, rather than most lamp cord that tends to be a bit flattened. This may also have something to do with this cord being a little stiffer than the typical lamp cord you may be most familiar with."

Even veteran contractors often do not know this product exists and it is a lifesaver. Due to the increase in use of Wi-Fi thermostats, which require a common, more people are using similar products. This is because Wi-Fi thermostats require a common . If a common ids required, you must have a minimum of five wires and many homes were wired with four wires if they had single stage heat abd mercury thermostats. This is a common issue with older hones. Another issue is that Low-voltage wiring is very fine and it is hard copper, not stranded. So, age can allow for deterioration and breakage causing problems. Since thermostat wires can be very difficult to pull, depending on if the wire is nailed inside the trusses, inside the walls, in a multi level home or condo, this product can also provide a replacement for a broken wire for a standard stat. This inexpensive product allows us to forgo running a new thermostat wire, at several hundred dollars expense to the customer. We can provide a replacement wire for a daily wine when pulling a new wire is difficult or cost prohibitive, or provide the common needed when needed for a wifi stat when only 4 wires exist. However, it is really designed for a professional to use not for the homeowner. It seems easy enough but truthfully a homeowner risks shorting tge unit or injuring themselves if they don't have the knowledge BBC a s it gets wired inside the air handler/furnace, as well as at the thermostat.",

These are incredibly fast and convenient - no argument there, and it's why I'm willing to pay a few more bucks than rolling my own. The downside that I've seen - the connectors on these seem a bit brittle. After finishing the first install (electrical) I was installing the refrigeration lineset. When I removed the cover, I put a little force (I do mean little) on the side of this whip - and the connector broke cleanly away from the conduit. I've not had this happen with ones I've put together on my own - and now get to repair this one - which kind of negates why I bought it in the first place. C'est la vie. If you're gentle with them, and don't mind the fixed length - they can save you a little time (and if you don't have any THHN on hand, money - especially if you just need a short length) - but if you don't mind spending just a little more time... roll your own.",

Well, decades later I am experienced and educated about thermostat wire cable. Very, very, rarely is the problem caused by bad thermostat wire cable itself. The thermostat wire problem is always caused by a person doing something wrong: stapling through the thermostat cable, shorting the conductors across a power transformer, crushing the thermostat wire cable between boards or vents, cutting the thermostat wire cable with a weed wacker, and etc.. Of course, I use a special staple gun that installs high arch staples that will not crush the thermostat wire cable. I run “loose” runs that can be “stretched” when necessary.

I wired my house, exterior and interior, a couple of years ago with this cable. We've been through two winters in the PNW with a couple weeks of snow each time and it has worked great. But now that I know it's CCA, looking back I would have opted for solid copper. I will be wiring another house but will be buying solid copper CAT5e from Home Depot instead because it's for someone else and I'd like to minimize any issues that might arise in the future. Home Depot has both indoor and outdoor bulk CAT5e cable. It's not as expensive as I thought it was going to be at Home Depot. I'm willing to pay a little extra for some peace of mind. Now I'm interested in running LAN speedtests to see what kind of speeds we're actually getting at home. If you end up buying this cable anyways, and specially if installing cable for someone else, I would highly recommend getting a decent cable tester like the ELEGIANT RJ11 RJ45 Cable Tester B01HCQSHNG. I would not recommend this cable for people who use their internet to work from home because it can turn into a troubleshooting nightmare if your internet connection starts dropping occasionally / sporadically. I would only recommend this cable for temporary solutions or people who have spare time to troubleshoot their network if an issue arises and have no problem re-terminating or re-running a wire. p.s.

        "Use with vintage equipment<<<Aesthetically pleasing cloth covering|||B0BRN8DWTL ★★★★★ [2023-03-07] <b>Beautiful appearance and high quality vintage style appliance wire</b> I was immediately struck that the cloth covering on this wire is so aesthetically pleasing. It looks and feels great to the touch; much better than the cloth covered wire from back in the day. I suspect the reason is that the modern 'cloth' contains some synthetics that weren't available 75 years ago. But this wire fits in fine with genuine vintage items, and this cloth is much more durable than the old stuff. I will be using it to rewire an old vintage lamp to get rid of the vinyl/plastic modern wire. I think it is a good choice to re-wire a valuable antique item as well. This wire is flexible but not as limp as most appliance wire. At first I thought the reason must be solid copper instead of stranded copper inside, which would be very strange. It's stranded not solid, however, and the lack of limpness is because the black-coated and white-coated copper stranded wires inside are embedded in a PVC 'cord' that is completely solid. In other words, there isn't a PVC tubing containing the 2 inner wires but rather a solid mass of PVC. Thus the whole thing is sturdier and heftier than it would be if it were a cloth covering over a PVC tubing containing 2 wires. Well done, as the resulting heft makes this wire seem substantial which adds a beautiful aesthetic to any vintage item. Once my re-wiring job is done if I learn any more I'll come back and edit this review."

I joined two of the conductors together to form a 200-ft loop for a resistance test and it measured 0.9 ohms (after subtracting 0.1 for my test leads). That’s about right for 16 AWG wire. And I love how they included heat shrink to protect your crimp points. This is for low voltage applications, as indicated in the product title. I realize that (at least at the time of this writing) the product description claims it can handle up to 600V, but I’m fairly certain it’s not UL listed for that to comply with electrical code. If you want to run full line voltage outdoors without conduit then you should be looking for UF-B wire and there are rules about how deep you have to bury it (usually one foot at the very least — and that’s assuming you have ground fault protection). This product is either for low voltage landscape lighting (12-24V) or telecommunications. You don’t normally need four conductors for lighting, but I’ll leave that to you to figure out. Maybe you’re trying something fancy."

The PVC insulation is tough and will stand up to abrasion. This cable should not be used for line voltage applications as the insulation is not rated for that application. I use 14/2 cable in my landscape lighting for the final connections to groups of LED fixtures. I use 12/2 for distribution over long distances to get to the clusters of fixtures. 14/2 works great in that application and helps to save a little money compared to running 12/2 everywhere. If your cable runs are all short and you have a modest number of LED fixtures then 14/2 may be good enough for the entire system. Note that 14/2 cable has a lower current rating than 12/2 cable, which is counterintuitive given the numbers are getting smaller as ampacity increases. So if you've got really long cable runs you'll probably want to use the 12/2 instead."

The outer black sheath is smooth and feeds well through conduit without lubrication. The product is priced very well if you think you are buying top quality copper conductor cable. The cons: This is really lousy cable. The conductors are supposed to be 23 AWG but the box I received measured below 24 AWG. The individual wires are brittle and break easily. So easily in fact that it was almost impossible to terminate in an RJ-45 plug. After spending hours placing this cable through walls and attic space, testing revealed there was a break somewhere along the cable. Makes perfect sense. Just manipulating the twisted pair to straighten for termination would cause at least one of the eight conductors to snap off. I have terminated lots of twisted pair cable and this was by far the most difficult to work with. Also, the product title does not indicate this is copper coated aluminum (CCA) cable wire."

When it comes to outdoor, 12v landscape lights, you need to properly size the cable for the circuit.

This is solid copper (the good stuff) 16 gauge cable, so it can handle up to 13 amps (which is about 1,500 watts!) but voltage does drop over distance. So this could easily handle one of the outdoor lighting kits or if you just want to add some more lights.

        "Electricity for wyze cams|||B0C27YYCXK ★★★★★ [2023-11-15] <b>Makes long 2-wire extension cords. The plugs are great.</b> I really like the wire-piercing plugs. This is just what I needed to get electricity to my wyze cams on the corners of my house. A couple of tips... 1) One reviewer mentioned red/black inner insulation, but mine did not have that. Instead, I used the white lettering on one of the two wires to connote the hot wire. The wire I received has white lettering on just one of the two conductors. I called that the \"hot\" wire and I made sure the piercing prongs on both ends mapped the white lettering to the \"hot prong\". The neutral prong is the wider of the two prongs on the plugs, so the hot is the narrow prong. 2) I found that the plugs each (male and female) have a couple of slots on the \"closed\" end (the open end is where the wire comes out of the fully assembled plug). I figured I would split about 3/8 of the insulation to have two separated ends and jam them into those slots. This way its impossible for the conductors to touch each other. Then lay the dual wire over the metal piercers and slide the back over the wire. However, before I slid the back cover on, I did tap the dual wire down carefully to ensure that the wires are thoroughly pierced. This allows the back to slide on easier. Nonetheless, I did find that I needed to tap the backs into place with a rubber mallet. If all the above sounds overly complicated, just know that its not difficult to put together the plugs, if just not brain-dead easy.",

        "Low voltage outdoor LED lighting<<<Not space efficient due to thick outer jacket|||B07MCF1BMP ★★★☆☆ [2022-12-27] <b>A very strange product. I would take 'outdoor rated' with a grain of salt</b> TL;DR version: If you intend to use this cable in an outdoor environment, I would look elsewhere. I have used several spools of this company's 3 conductor wire for various projects and it has worked out well. The conductors are not undersized, and the outer cable sheath is properly tough. So I decided to give their 2 conductor wire a try. It turned out to be a very oddly constructed 2 conductor cable. My biggest issue is that the outer protective layer is MUCH bigger than required. It is literally the same outer sheath size as the 3 conductor cable I have used often - it literally appears that they just pulled one conductor out of their 3 conductor cable, put it on a reel, and sold it. This is not great for a couple of reasons: 1) The cable is thicker than it needs to be (not space efficient), so anyone working with limited space for their wire runs, or wire runs that are visible (like low voltage outdoor LED lighting), may want to look elsewhere. 2) This stuff says it is outdoor rated. However it is outdoor rated for UV exposure only. Because there is so much empty space within the outer jacket, anyone wanting to use this outdoors in damp climates or around water (irrigation wiring, landscape lighting, etc) should realize that the outer jacket is going to rapidly fill up with water (and stay filled), causing several types of issues: - Electric issues: any minor wire scrapes or damage could result in hard-to-trace shorts or random voltage drops. - Extra water weight: The extra weight all of that water filling up the PVC jacket could be significant. I intended to use this cable for outdoor permanent installations of LED light strings, hung or mounted in various ways on my house and in landscaping. I live in a wet climate, and after a few months of rainy fall/winter/spring weather I estimate that the added weight of all that water filling up the empty space within the cable jacket would more than double the total weight of the cable runs. With a couple hundred feet of cable, that weight will add up pretty quickly. - Water damage: Depending on how/where your cabling is routed, you could essentially be installing a de-facto water pipe that will shunt rain and/or irrigation water through the excess space within the outer jacket and into areas of your walls/house that would otherwise have remained perfectly dry. A potential recipe for serious hidden water damage. I ended up returning this and buying a different product elsewhere."

Overall, decent price for good cord. 4 stars"

        "Heating equipment<<<Resistant to soldering temperatures (over 800 degrees Fahrenheit)|||B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ [2023-06-30] <b>Great for DIYers and reasonably priced for copper with silicone insulation</b> The price for copper wire has gone up so dramatically in the last few years, I did a lot of rewiring in my house a few years back and a spool of 12/2 1000 feet Romex was $260 and now over $500 a roll at Lowes or HomeDepot. The prices for these spools are cheaper than similar PVC coated wires at Walmart for 20 gauge wire and these have more expensive silicone coating and tinned copper. Price wise these are very good wires and good for small projects or repairs on electronics. The wire is very flexible and good for replacing cheaper wires in outdoor equipment that are subject to the elements or chemicals. The silicone is good for almost degrees 400F which is great for power and heating equipment as they are more chemical resistant and won't melt as easily. I have two outdoor portable water heaters used for camping and the wiring on the units use the cheaper PVC and the insulation can melt when the heaters are used for extended periods. I have had to wrap the wires in aluminum heat wrap to protect the PVC cables now I can repair them with the silicone wires without having to wrap them with protective aluminum heat shields."

I’ve been wanting to relocate the power and emergency stop switch on a Chinese Lathe/Milling machine so that I will have easier access to it in case of an emergency. I hope this 18 gauge wire isn’t going to be under-rated for my application as the current wire appears to be pretty thin as well. Finding multi-conductor wire with more than 6 conductors at 16 or 14 gauge at a reasonable price is quite difficult and if I find this wire isn’t the right size I can always use low current relays and contactors as a work-around. If you’re running wire for speakers, PA or intercom system, this wire is perfect for those applications. And from some of the prices I’ve seen lately, this is a steal for 50 ft. of copper.",
        "Speaker rewiring|||B0BYNNJS8B ★★★★★ [2023-08-27] <b>Super Flex - Silicone Insulation</b> Super Duper High Temperature Flexible Silicone Insulation!! I don't remember when I've worked with wire this flexible. The Silicone is so 'rubbery' it's almost hard to cut and both the insulation and the wire is as flexible as the insulation. It doesn't 'hold' a shape well at all it's just so flexible. The high temp insulation makes it nice for soldering, it doesn't shrink off or split out from the heat of nearby soldering - and the temp range is also low (cold). I didn't test it, but the low end spec is -76F.. (So obviously I'd have something special around to make any claim about testing it anywhere near that.) I'll have to pickup a couple new rolls for my next trip to Antarctica (lol). It's a whole bunch heavier at 10 gauge than I normally use but I have a couple projects that will use up most of, if not all of the rolls. I'm adding fog lights to my car and I'm rewiring a couple speakers. It feels so nice that if I have any left, I may just rig up a new set of test leads for my multi-meter. Also available in smaller gauges, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 & 22, those other sizes are probably more commonly used and more in line with the size I'd usually pickup for small general purpose projects - but the fog lights, can draw a bunch of current, so for a 10 ft run in a car, this can handle >200 watts, or plenty enough for my fog lights.",

Nothing on the carton, nothing on the spools. The carton has check boxes for what gauge wire is inside. None was checked so I guess I'll have to trust I got 18AWG. Additionally the carton says silicone on one end and PVC on the other. It's described in this listing as silicon rubber. So I did I get what I bought?

I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful."

The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful."

His entire downstairs lab is filled with wires, cables, switches, leds, and all kinds of other things I have no clue about the use for. To me, wire is wire, but when he saw that I could order this box of six kinds, he asked me to jump on it. When they came, he disappeared right downstairs with the box, and a bit later came back up, excited to show me how wonderful they are. He was honestly grinning. About wire. He showed me how the wires he had installed easily bent into position and tucked out of the way of what needed to be worked on next and where he would button the piece up when finished. He said the silicone housing strips off easily to cut and solder that soldering was easy with them. I can honestly say that there was no cussing or need for him to step away from his project with these, so that's a ringing endorsement."

Insulation on this wire is a lot more heat resistant and the heat can be cranked up to solder guitar pots faster. The insulation also low(ish) friction, so if you zip-tie a couple together, they stay put. The cable is very soft and flexible which is great in things that are regularly moved around.

The insulation could have been a little thinner and sometimes makes the wire a little difficult to work with in tight spots where many wires need to be connected to a small connection point and so on. That said it's unlikely to short, the insulation is unlikely to perish to the point where it's not insulating. It's also true that the whole roll is a single length of wire, so it would be suitable for a low current and fairly long distance connection too. It's a good thing to have but primarily useful for connections to a power source."

This wire should only be used for a table lamp, from the lamp to the wall plug. The other concerning feature is 18ga copper. The copper stains are too thin to work-with, they are brittle to bend around a connection screw. Soldering is required to support the stains. Why the industry has gone to such small gauge 18ga ( setting aside the min amps & volts ) is because they have never rewire an appliance. 16ga should be the workable appliance size wire."

Between the 4 conductors in the cable, you get 400ft of wire for $50 right now. Naoevo also included a whole whack of zip ties and heat shrink tubing which is an excellent inclusion to help with your wire install. The outer layer is a kind of thin rubber or plastic sheathing. It doesn't feel super strong, but it'll keep your wires organised over long runs. It'll also look better than 4 loose wires. The wires themselves are true 18 gauge and helpfully color coated to ensure you get your connections in the right place. The outer sheathing is a little bit annoying to strip away since it's so stretchy, but if you cut it vertically with your wire cutters, then clip off the verticle strips, you can get 'er done. The individual wire insulation is easy to strip and work with though. As far as the application for this kind of wire, I used this to have a clean run from my home theater receiver out to my rear channel speakers. Keeps the four wires nice and clean for the long main cable run, then you can strip back the outer sheathing where you need to connect the speakers themselves. This would also be excellent for car applications. This stiffer wire is easier to push through the car interior than single floppy wires are. All in all, as said at the start, this is a great value for all that wire and the included install gear. If you need versitile wire at a great price, this is for you!"

Well, you can imagine the mess in that box if I'd done it all w/wire nuts! I had to use pigtails on the line, neutral and ground wires. That meant 4 wires bound together for line, 6 for neutral, 6 for ground. Using these made that process easy and clean. I also used the Wago 221-412 lever nuts connecting the pigtails to the switches. Since each switch needed 4 connectors, the small Wagos made it very easy! As always, do things meticulously when doing wiring! Always visually ensure the all wires are inserted fully into each connector. After you push each connector bunch into the box, validate all wires are still fully inserted and on the 221s, ensure the levers are shut. Love these!",

Some say these are a fire hazard. Look at videos on Youtube showing these taking 60Amps of current (well able the stated limit of 20Amps). In the videos the wire coating smoldered but the wire connector did not burn. I found these to be easy to use and easy to verify I had a good connection. And I had enough room to put the wires back into the traditional electricians coil with ground, neutral, hot, and traveler ordering as well as the much deeper insulated smart plug case. Remember that whereas a wire nut can be removed and retightened when using stranded wire, these connectors much be removed and replaced for stranded wire. If one is using solid wire, then the connect can safely be removed and reused. So plan well when connecting them. Use the traditional electricians coiling techniques (same technique they use to prepare the wires during the rough in, prior to the drywall work)."

And you need to add a common wire from your smart switch... and that wire keeps falling out b/c the switch wire is smaller than what's installed. It turns a pain in the ass into something that's easily updateable.

I believe my issue is that my basement fluctuates from low 60's to mid 70's and had the vents on the ceiling near the walls. The vent blows hot when the walls are cold. Doesn't seem great for varying temperatures. the other soffit where the ghost wire runs is opposite side of the drywall from another vent.. Cleaning your walls has a huge difference. While I cleaned mine, I've seen many people have issues who did not wash their walls before installation and have had troubles with sticking. Great idea and good implementation, could be improved on but still better than seeing wires if you cant run them appropriately.",
        "Home theater wiring<<<Poor adhesion to walls|||B079NXCN6B ★★☆☆☆ [2024-01-06] <b>Big letdown, really wanted to like this.</b> So I decided to do things right, which meant I skipped buying the cheapest m0n0 price self adhesive ribbon speaker wire, and I skipped the next one Fr@nk lys . SO why is your product 3x as much as the cheapest and 2x as the next one down? I thought clearly it meant superior product right?? But noooo. Only 2 minutes after firmly pressing down the tape on my already clean and dry walls, i started hearing the dreading peeling crackling sound just slowly going on for several minutes. I'm like are you on or you off? Make up your mind! SO I just wanted to wait it out, for review purposes. It lasted a full 7 minutes before completely unraveling itself. So I pushed it back, pressing it harder and waited, that came off in about 3 minutes. What is the point if it won't stick at all? So I then had to carefully roll it back to fit in the hole provided in the box so I could send this back for return. I'm hoping the return is accepted, I'm sorry that it can't work out. I tried. Unfortunately, I'll be going with the nail clips which are a bit more time consuming but will be permanent. But fortunately, it will look a lot cleaner and I won't need to paint it, (so not really longer) since my moulding is also white. if I decide to sell the house, the next person will be treated to pre wired home theatre. Sewell makes some good quality products. I bought their banana plugs and I think they were easy to use and had a nice package to keep them stored for later. I just think this one is a big miss, but will continue wiht their other products."

        "Home theater wiring<<<Difficulty in making 90° bends|||B079NXCN6B ★★★★★ [2020-06-08] <b>Ghost Wire</b> Everything with the order was fine. My son is using this to retrofit my TV room (w/projector) with the latest in A/V technology. He told me that the ghost wire installation was easy, with the exception of making 90° bends, which he described as a pain, but with more experience, I would guess that this becomes easier. The one 90° bend that he did do looks a little funky, but this (ghost wire) is SO much easier than trying to snake wires through the studs behind the drywall, which is really a virtually impossible task without removing the drywall, which is not happening... We will be repainting the walls in dark brown as the walls now (white±) reflect too much light with the new, more powerful 4K projector, so I am hoping that the paint virtually hides the ghost wire which is really only visible because the ghost wire color is a bit different than the walls (as they are now - white±)."

I’ve got several uses for this type of wire. We have a lot of security systems here on our ranch and this could be very useful, for alarms, CCTV cameras, monitoring, and other low voltage projects. I love it that it’s brown and can be concealed very easily. They offer this in various lengths to match your needs. It has five conductors which can allow for a wide variety of applications. it comes spooled in a ziplock type bag. This seems to be good quality wire. As far as value for the money, well, all wire has gone up in price lately, and this is probably right in line with what you would expect to pay for good quality multi-strand wire. There seems to be a mistake in the listing regarding price per foot on a couple of the links. I ordered the 150 foot spool for about $75, which is 50 cents per foot. Not bad."

Then, they're a set of saw horses, or a table, or a seat, or a pipe vice, or tool rack, or .... They serve tons of different functions on a job site -- or even around the home and shop. They are very thick and sturdy, and are stable in all of the different configurations they're designed for. I have just two little nits about these: 1. There are two small steel bars that act as connecting pegs, to hold the two plates together vertically. They don't get used often, so there's a very good chance they'll get lost. There are a couple of indented areas on each plate that look like the bars should be stored in; but the bars just fall out. There's nothing to hold them in. With all of the careful, thoughtful, designing that went into this system; I'm amazed this wasn't dealt with. 2. The two halves clip together nicely, but there's no good way to store them. The assembly is still very bulky and awkward, even after disassembling it and clipping the two halves together -- and they will fall apart if you try to hang them up. Bottom line: A couple of little issues that should be considered; but still an amazingly useful product.",

I wired my house, exterior and interior, a couple of years ago with this cable. We've been through two winters in the PNW with a couple weeks of snow each time and it has worked great. But now that I know it's CCA, looking back I would have opted for solid copper. I will be wiring another house but will be buying solid copper CAT5e from Home Depot instead because it's for someone else and I'd like to minimize any issues that might arise in the future. Home Depot has both indoor and outdoor bulk CAT5e cable. It's not as expensive as I thought it was going to be at Home Depot. I'm willing to pay a little extra for some peace of mind. Now I'm interested in running LAN speedtests to see what kind of speeds we're actually getting at home. If you end up buying this cable anyways, and specially if installing cable for someone else, I would highly recommend getting a decent cable tester like the ELEGIANT RJ11 RJ45 Cable Tester B01HCQSHNG. I would not recommend this cable for people who use their internet to work from home because it can turn into a troubleshooting nightmare if your internet connection starts dropping occasionally / sporadically. I would only recommend this cable for temporary solutions or people who have spare time to troubleshoot their network if an issue arises and have no problem re-terminating or re-running a wire. p.s. I've loved using 4.5mm saddle brackets B01NBLP9RU + exterior screws + zip ties to tie down cables, specially if running outdoors or more than one cable along the same path. sturdiest setup I've come across."

One of the most common tactics of the “low cost leaders” is to use aluminum instead of copper wire. This can lead to network issues from using inferior materials to transmit the signal. Looking to cut costs, manufacturers started using aluminum wire dipped in a thin coating of copper. This technique created an aluminum core cable surrounded by a thin layer of copper. The performance and safety of CCA cables are radically different. In fact, aluminum network cables violate TIA and IEC standards for Cat5e and Cat6 cables. CCA cable has higher attenuation than pure copper cables. This results in a greater loss of data, as packets have to be re-transmitted. The more data that is re-transmitted, the slower your network performs. Plus, these problems are compounded by every foot of cable you use; the longer the cable, the worse the performance. CCA cables also have a 55% higher DC resistance. This increases the amount of energy that is transferred into heat and reduces the amount of power that can be transferred. This issue makes them unusable for power over Ethernet (PoE) devices like IP cameras and phones. These cut corners also affect installers because aluminum wire creates installation issues. Due to the lower tensile strength, aluminum cables can be damaged when being pulled. Single conductors can break, making the cable useless, or the whole cable can snap. Aluminum also has a lower bend radius than pure copper cables. This means you can’t bend it as much before it fails. In short, spend the extra money on solid core copper cable."

It isn't a good wire to use for hooking up sensors unless the sensors are hard mounted to the same board you're hooking them up on, and in that case, if planned properly, you could save the money you'd spend on this wire and purchase yourself a rental of a cup of coffee.

We would have loved to have this in the past few months as we had to buy wire separately (and wire is expensive!) The reason why I am giving this three stars is that value-wise, all the non-wire parts of this isn't really worth the upcharge considering the small length of wire you are getting. I did a basic comparison, and another seller is doing six colors, 100 feet each of 18 gauge and that was $27. This would make a good beginner gift but the little extras like the strippers, the dispensing box, the ties....those are all very ehhhh. You know, expected low quality. I realize wire is expensive, but less than 200 feet total of wire versus 600 feet, even if two extra colors and some extra fiddly stuff for application, and paying $7ish extra for the privilege? Ehhhh...... That being said, I like the kit itself and it is very handy for small patches or projects.

        "Indoor or protected environments<<<Melt resistant insulation|||B01K4RPB3O ★★★★★ [2023-02-16] <b>Good quality, high strand-count high flexibility tinned wire with silicone rubber insulation</b> This 22 AWG (gauge) silicone insulated wire is excellent for indoor or protected environments where high flexibility/lack of stiffness, and non-melting (or at least melt resistant) insulation is required. The conductors are a 'high strand count\" type, meaning that instead of being comprised of just a few larger/thicker strands, it is instead comprised of a much greater number of smaller/thinner strands; and this contributes to its lack of stiffness/great flexibility. The other contributing factor to the high flexibility is that the insulation is silicone rubber, rather than the more common PVC (which is rather stiff). This kind of high strand count, silicone rubber insulated wire is exactly what high quality test equipment 'test leads' have been made of for decades. The silicone rubber is also much less heat sensitive than more common insulations such as PVC or \"machine tool wire\". It won't melt off as readily as PVC insulation does if your soldering iron needs to be held onto a joint or terminal for an extended period of time. The fine wire strands are also nicely tinned, and the insulation strips off easily and cleanly, and the stranded wire solders easily. It is a good quality product at an affordable price. HOWEVER, it is not the best choice for many common \"hook up wire\" applications, since its lack of stiffness can be an issue; the strands definitely need to be twisted and soldered in order to keep their shape enough to be formed into a hook before soldering around a terminal for example. This wire also does not want to cooperate if you want to twist a few of them together, because their limpness makes them uncooperative in that regard. And if you use this wire in \"hook up wire\" applications, it wants to just flop into some odd position rather than 'staying put' where you want it to be. Silicone rubber insulation is also not that great when it comes to abrasion resistance, and resistance to some kinds of oils and such where other insulations may be preferable."

        "Small patches or projects<<<23 feet of each color|||B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★☆☆ [2024-03-25] <b>Good kit but value isn't great for length of wire</b> This is excellent for beginners, or for people trying to patch a couple of sections on their car's wiring loom. We would have loved to have this in the past few months as we had to buy wire separately (and wire is expensive!) The reason why I am giving this three stars is that value-wise, all the non-wire parts of this isn't really worth the upcharge considering the small length of wire you are getting. I did a basic comparison, and another seller is doing six colors, 100 feet each of 18 gauge and that was $27. This would make a good beginner gift but the little extras like the strippers, the dispensing box, the ties....those are all very ehhhh. You know, expected low quality. I realize wire is expensive, but less than 200 feet total of wire versus 600 feet, even if two extra colors and some extra fiddly stuff for application, and paying $7ish extra for the privilege? Ehhhh...... That being said, I like the kit itself and it is very handy for small patches or projects.

This wire should only be used for a table lamp, from the lamp to the wall plug. The other concerning feature is 18ga copper. The copper stains are too thin to work-with, they are brittle to bend around a connection screw. Soldering is required to support the stains.

I once did a job that I could not complete using old-fashioned copper wires. I looked for an alternative and found these wires. I'll never go back. These wires can safely handle 10x to 20x the load needed to power the few bulbs of an average lamp. They are also extremely flexible, easy to hide, and can easily get into narrow passages and tight bends that would be challenging for ordinary cables. If you use them once, you'll never want to use anything else."

I've ordered directly from Copper Wire USA's website before and prefer to purchase from them (either at their Amazon store or from their website) for all my bare copper wire needs and would highly recommend them to others who need bare copper wire. The 14 gauge dead soft copper round wire on a spool is good (very good quality, packaged well, speedy delivery, etc,) but due to a mistake on my part, I should've taken into consideration that even with dead soft wire, any copper wire larger than 18 gauge should be coiled. It's just so much easier to straighten. I could anneal it but that's extra work and cleaning I don't want to deal with so I should've spent the extra 3 bucks on their website for a coil with 10 extra feet of wire. Again, this was MY FAULT because I didn't want to spend $3 extra because I thought it would potentially be ok on a spool but it's much harder to straighten the kinks out. I knew better and ordered it anyway; therefore, I will keep it and use it for texturing."

One reviewer mentioned that the wires are not actually tinned; that is true. It's not a big deal when you are rewiring a lamp but it probably should be removed from the description. Once I rewired my lamps, I found that I love the vintage look of the wire so I decided to make some \"vintage\" extension cords using repro antique plugs and some new old stock surface mount receptacles. They look really cool, and they don't spoil the vintage look of my room and my lamps. Just remember that this is 18 gauge wire so you don't want it to be carrying more than 15 amps. Overall, I really like this wire and it's a simple way to keep that vintage look without having to use dangerous old wire. It's a great value and it does the job admirably."

The silicone was a bit thicker than I was hoping for, but it worked out for me. This seems like nice wire. The insulation stripped cleanly with just two light cuts on opposing sides and a tug. It's nice a flexible. It soldered very well. I recommend it. My only noteable potential negative is insulation was a bit thick for 30AWG, in terms of fitting within small projects.

Roll</b> Can’t complain about paying $35 less on Amazon than in local big box stores where it is $90 before tax! Wire is new, real, unused & undamaged 10/3 romex I will be using for my dryer install. I need this because I installed sup-panel & the breaker for my dryer is a 240v, 30amp GFCI, so dryer has to have 4-prong outlet & 4-prong dryer cord, which 10/3 is what you need (2 hots, 1 neutral & 1 ground)."
