I replaced it with an old stereo speaker and that did the job nicely sound wise at least. But it looked janky plus worse, I kept managing to hit it. So I found some small speakers and ordered a 9ft RCA to bare wire wires. lol SMH, measure?! Ain't nobody got time fo dat! 9ft turned out all of an inch too short. lol Because of course it did. Whoops. So when I came across these for review I jumped on them. These 12 AWG are definitely overkill for just simple speaker wiring. So they got the job done nicely and then some. They seem like really quality wires. There was zero issue with attaching them to the 14 AWG RCA wires with some self soldering butt connectors. I'm happy with these.",

The wire must be flexible in this application since it bends each time the coil expands and contracts. This wire consists of many fine strands of flexible copper encased in a silicone rubber sheathing. Very flexible - absolutely perfect for an application in which the wire must bend to accommodate the movement of a mechanical device. And I might add, at a very competitive price.",

At first glance the wire looked to be a smaller gauge than it is but I have been looking at larger gauge wire the last couple of days. The wire clearly states 14AWG on the insulation. This is all tinned copper wire and designed for low voltage like car wiring. You get 50’ of both the black and red insulated wire. That is a great price, probably half of what I have seen wire selling for. The wire has good flexibility and has a good feel in your hands. This should be able to carry sufficient amperage for most of your 12-volt lighting or speaker need as long as the distance is not too long.

There's a black, white and red with a bare ground wire. People have commented it's not 10/3. The black, white and red wires are considered hot. You wrap the white wire in your panel in black electrical tape to show it's actually a hot wire. It's called phasing the wire. People are confusing the white wire as a neutral. Yes. It can be a neutral if you want to like what I'm going to do from my outside house panel to my Tuff Shed panel I purchased from Home Depot. If you need proof: your home water heater runs on 10/2. There's a black, white and a ground wire. The black wire is connected to the black wire on the water heater. The white wire is wrapped in black electrical tape to show it's hot (phasing the wire) and that's connected to the red wire on the water heater. Of course the ground wire goes on the green ground screw on your water heater. So yes this is a true 10/3. Don't believe the comments saying this isn't a 10/3 underground.

For me, that's a great selling point and one of the reasons that I ordered this coil of wire. The short version of this review can be summed up in one word: perfect. The outer insulation of this wire strips easily with either a romex stripping tool or (shudder) a sharp knife. The individual conductors’ insulation can be removed almost as easily as it’s not bonded to the surface of the copper conductor. Thankfully the conductors themselves are solid copper wire and not copper clad aluminum otherwise known as CCA. And for a bit more icing on the cake, this coil of Arizona Electrical Solutions wire costs less than half of what the same length coil of wire in the big box stores near me costs. And in case 25 feet of 14 gauge wire is not what you need for your next project, this company also sells other gauges and lengths here on Amazon. And again, it's made in America. This is truly a winner.",

The Bntechgo insulation did not melt and was a bit thicker. Add in the extra fine tinned stranding and you have a very substantial product in my opinion. Going to use it in my truck engine compartment and expect it to stand up to the heat nicely.",

      "14 gauge stranded copper wire|||B07Q5JXYCP ★★★★☆ [2022-01-13] <b>Wire is 5 stars, connectors get 3 stars.</b> There's not much to say about the wire other than it is your typical low voltage, outdoor rated, direct bury 14 gauge stranded copper wire. It is solid copper, and not plated like you'll get with lower priced wire. The price is at least 25% less than what you'll pay in a big box store. The connectors don't come with instructions although they are somewhat intuitive to install. Installation goes much easier if you attach the connector to the 14 gauge wire first by separating about 3\" of the two 14 gauge vconductors. Then unscrewing the larger size cap end of the connector. Underneath the cap you'll see a long metal pin. The pin will pierce the insulation of the wire when you screw the cap back on the connector. Once you have it attached to the 14 gauge wire unscrew the cap on the other end of the connector. This cap will have a small hole in which you insert the stripped end of whatever wire is coming from the light fixture you're trying to attach. Make sure you strip about a half an inch of insulation off that wire. I inserted this wire through the hole of the cap and then into the open end of the connector. They'll be a small metal rod sticking up and you want to press the wire in as far as it'll go and then screw the cap back on. If all went well the pressure of the cap will hold the wire inside the connector. I'm not sure about the weather resistance of the metal used inside this connector so I used some electrical corrosion prevention paste, which is a dark gray silicon based gel that is sold to help weatherproof outdoor electrical connections or when you're dealing with aluminum wiring. Hopefully the paste will make the connection more weather resistant. So far they've been out in the yard for a few months and I haven't had any issues.",

The roll of wire comes with plenty of short heat shrink tubing pieces, several wire ties, and two reusable hook-and-loop wire wraps. The insulation on each wire is thick and durable PVC and the outer jacket is flexible, yet durable PVC material. The wires inside the outer jacket are not bonded to the outer jacket, instead, they float inside the outer jacket. This allows the user to easily pull the wires out of the jacket as needed. This wire would make an excellent automotive or marine wire harness for multiple lights that require separate control.

This 14/2 cable is perfect for that need. When you have a run of 1500 to 2000 LEDs in a single run you need to inject power approximately every 300 pixels or so depending the pixels you are using and the lighting effect you are trying to accomplish.

      "12 gauge wire|||B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ [2023-03-03] <b>Interesting wire if you never worked with it before, very little voltage drop..</b> I read some reviews before ordering this, so I was aware that this was not your typical multi-strand copper wire that is used in automotive and industrial applications for low DC voltage. I needed 12 gauge wire for a project, and thought I would give this a try. A 20 ft run of this wire supplying 14.3 volts DC with a constant load of 25 amps showed only .15 volts of voltage drop. Comparable multi-strand copper wire in another circuit of the same wire length and specifications was showing a .21 voltage drop. Yes, there could be other items in play that I am not accounting for, but this is just merely indicating that this wire type is not any WORSE of a conductor than what you would normally purchase at the parts store to repair wiring on your vehicle. The added flexibility of the wire seems to be a plus, especially since I was wiring in some off-road lights when it was 15 deg F outside. This wire remained very pliable, unlike its multi-strand copper wire cousin. I see no reason I wouldn't use this again nor any reason why you shouldn't consider it a good option for your automotive wiring needs.",

The insulation seems to be adequate. This wire has numerous strands that are not 100% copper. In looking at the ends there seems to be some copper in the strands, but a VERY small amount. The red and black conductors are not fused as is often common for this type of wire.

I added pictures of the strands, before and after applying high heat. Note, the end of the strands ball up, which is a trait of copper, not aluminum.

I prefer this, as silicone jackets generally tear easily if they are too thin. The wire gauge is at least true to size. I haven't stripped and weighed it, but it fits snugly in my 10AWG crimp terminals.

The wire is - nice supple / pliable PVC insulated 1/4\" outside diameter 16 gauge tinned copper. The Engineering Tool Box specs this wire at 6 amp carrying capacity up to 1000v @ 30 deg.

I ordered the 12 awg with 10 feet of each red and black. I was just trying to round out my stock a bit as I already had some 10, 14 and 16 awg silicone wire around. I tend to order BNTechGo as I tried them once and was plenty happy with it. This stuff seems just as good as far as I can tell. My main concern was if it was real tinned copper or not so I stripped a section and scraped it with a sharp knife until I could clearly see the copper start showing through the tin. So yes, this is definitely real copper. The strands are extremely fine, which is great for flexibility but can make it tough to strip without cutting some. But that's the case with all flexible silicone wire, so no real issue there compared to other brands. These 10' sections came in just loose coils in a resealable pouch, which I guess is fine given how short they are; normally I prefer spools. All in all this wire seems just as good as other more established brands and costs less. Works for me.",

I ran this cable under my gazebo, where I have a little solar setup. I usually go out there and do movie nights on my days off from work. This cable is 30 feet black and 30 feet red. Some brands advertise 30 feet, but later, you find out they meant 15 feet black and 15 feet red. I can confirm that the wire is copper and not just coated. The insulation feels durable. It is thick but still very easy to bend. This is great if you dont have a straight shot where you are running it. I have the cable running from my solar panel on the roof down to my solar controller.

The flexible KWANGIL 16 AWG wire makes this process much easier than the stiffer 18 AWG speaker wire that I had previously been using. As an added bonus, this wire is UV stable and also tinned to protect it from corrosion. And the tinned wire is super easy to solder. KWANGIL even supplies the coil with an end cap on each wire end to keep the wire in perfect condition until it’s ready to be used. The 20 feet of wire is supplied wound in a ~7 ½ inch coil and packaged in a sealed plastic bag. Thanks to the large size of the coil, when the wire is unwrapped it lays fairly flat unlike wire that has been tightly coiled. Stripping the outer jacket was just as easy as the listing said it would be. I stripped 4 inches from one end with no problem. Stripping the individual wires on the other hand isn’t as easy. The insulation on each wire is tight but that also keeps moisture away. Stripping ½ inch took a bit of work, stripping 1 inch I found easiest to do in two ½ inch pieces.

      "16 AWG|||B0C84BL61V ★★★★★ [2023-08-12] <b>Nice assortment of flexible wire</b> I ordered the 16AWG wire and overall I'm very pleased with it. The wire is very flexible and appears to be sized correctly. The conductors are tinned copper (not copper coated aluminum) as described and there are a large number of individual conductors - helping considerably to make the wire as flexible as it is. The insulation appears and feels to be silicone (also as described). The colors are also vibrant as in the description. One nice feature is that each spool of wire is individually labelled - so once these leave their original box and I pick up a spool in 6 months I won't be wondering whether the wire is 14, 16 or 18 AWG - the spool is clearly labeled 16AWG. Overall I don't see anything at all wrong with this wire and give it five stars.",

      "14 AWG (14/2)|||B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★☆ [2023-06-05] <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again).",

Heat shrink tubing historically does not perform well on silicone wire, so do keep that in mind. That being said, I seriously doubt this is pure silicone. Pure silicone is almost so rubbery that it has zero memory. This is good, but not the best I've felt. The wire itself seems to be 14AWG, and is very, very fine, which I wanted.

The stranding measures a little over 1mm diameter, so 16 gauge is also accurate. The wiring jacket says AWM on it, so this would be suitable for appliances needing a new plug (this is not SJOOW and shouldn't be used for extension cables). When I stripped the jacket back there was a weird white powder substance (I presume from manufacturing). I bought this to extend the cable length on a portable LED flood light and had no issues soldering this wire. I am unsure why the listing title says low voltage, given there is a ground wire, but I can only presume it's because it uses a red/black color for live and neutral opposed to the industry standard blue/white coloring.

      "36 strand 16 AWG braided wire|||B0CLBHT8YX ★★★★☆ [2024-03-27] <b>Good for small projects</b> It seems I'm always scrounging for sections of wire on different RV projects and usually find something leftover from an older finished project that works but maybe is not the best (such as by adding pigtails). This has 5 fifty foot rolls of 5 colors that should end the scrounging. This is a copper clad aluminum core (CCA) wire. The copper reduces corrosion caused by moisture and oxidation and adds surface conductivity. I got it to use for some small 12V wiring projects in the RV (additional 12 volt computer fan for gas refrigerator cooling) and to have on hand when I just need some short lengths of wire. For reference, Cu Clad Al (CCA) wire can be used for main wire projects but at a much larger gauge as aluminum has a higher resistance than copper. 12 AWG is recommended for a 15 Amp 110V circuit and 10 AWG for a 20 Amp. This is a 36 strand 16 AWG braided wire so it's not made for heavy loads or 110 volt wiring. Specs are for up to 80 volts. The wire is flexible and there's enough copper coating for it to solder easily to itself. If there's trouble having the wire stick, a copper infused solder works. I used some lead free Rosin Core 2.0 Sn99 Ag0.3 Cu0.7 electronics solder and everything was sucked into the wire and stuck together. I couldn't find the percent by weight of copper anywhere on the rolls, package, or website. The range for CCA is anywhere from 10% to 24% by weight, with the more the better (but also more expensive). 15 small zip ties and 10 heat shrink tubes are included in the box. I'm never going to use this on a main AC wiring project but for small electrical projects, it's a good economical choice and should last a long time. If you don't want 5 colors and a dispenser box, 4-color roll packages of 100'/roll 16AWG of this brand are the same price if you shop around. 4 stars - copper specs not given.",

The insulation is good quality and feels the exact same as other silicone wire I have purchased at the orange big box store. It also took solder without any issue which is great as I have gotten wire on amazon that did not. A few things to note around the product listing, it says it's rated for 19 amps, this is really pushing things, 16AWG is light duty size. Most of your cheap extension cords use 16AWG so you really shouldn't be pushing more than 13 amps through this wire. It says it complies with North American Safety Standards but nothing on the box or wire had the normal stamps and marks that you find on wire you buy at the big box stores so I don't trust that claim. If you are using this for some basic stuff like lights or 12v applications, then it's really not a big deal but I would not use this for anything drawing any sort of amps over 10 and certainly would not put this behind a wall.",

      "12 AWG version available|||B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★☆ [2023-06-05] <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again).",

I like that this wire is rated for direct burial and waterproof, so long as it remains undamaged. It's easy enough to slide this through some conduit or at least sections of old garden hose or something to make it more durable and resist chafing. The PVC sleeve is somewhat loose and the individual wires can be removed from short sections fairly easily. Not very flexible, but easy enough to bend.

There are two mid pieces that contain a rubber sleeve. Two size sleeves are provided: 5mm and 12mm. They are squeezed by tightening the end caps to form a watertight seal on the exterior wire jacket. Note that the description of 5-12mm wire size refers to this outer cable jacket. The mid pieces screw together over the center section which contains the wire splicing block. It appears that up to 16 gauge wire could be used. Each wire is placed in a ferrule and is captured by a screw that is tightened such that the wire is pushed into the ferrule body, which contains a similar screw arrangement on the other side allowing two wires to be spliced/connected. The mid pieces screw over the center section and the joint is made waterproof by an o-ring on each side. They claim IP68, which means that the connection should not be continuously kept underwater. I tested the connector under a running faucet for 5 minutes and no water got inside. It should be fine in any rainstorm. I would not place it where it could be exposed to strong streams of water, such as in a pressure washer. The rating of 24A means no more than 6A per contact. If you use this for more than 50V, I would make sure that all strands on the wire are inside the ferrule and that the wire insulation goes right up to the ferrule to minimize creapage paths for high voltage. Overall, this is a very effective and compact way of splicing wires that will be exposed to weather. These were installed on the control cables of an amateur radio antenna system.

The insulation is thick, still flexible enough to work with. I used it on a 24V Solar power project and on a car sound system; it worked perfectly on both projects. The insulation looks and feels more “rubberized” than “hard plastic”, which gives the wire the flexibility needed, specifically for when you have to run the wire through panels, and it helps routing too, it looks more neat and easier to secure it.

Amazon delivered this wire last night and I didn't find it till morning. The package was covered in snow and it was 20F. I opened the package, and this wire was as flexible as it could be. I started to make a cable with it and noticed the two wires split very easily, too easily. With only moderate use this wire will keep separating. The ends should always have a piece of heat shrink tubing at the ends to prevent it from becoming two wires, even when storing. That is partially an effect of the insulation being so flexible. From the picture you can see how many small flexible strands there are. I measured one with my caliper and the reading was 0.002 inches. This is really nice wire to work with because of the extreme flexibility. I took a piece of insulation and hit it with my soldering iron set to 593F.

The people who built my house put GFICI outlets on the back of the house around the pool area and time, and the second owners, have taken their toll on them. For whatever reason, so were taken out by ripping the plastic conduit off the boxes and the wires just cut off. How it ever passed home inspection is beyond me, but being the electrician that I am, I have been working on replacing them. Since I was already in the process, I decided to use this wire since it should cover the code requirements for the outlets. I pulled out the old wire from the subpanel (with the power off, off course). Being in Florida, the old wire was about 50 years old and crusty with the humidity and having had various creatures in there over the years. This wire was fully pliable at 14 gauge, and I had no issues pulling in through the bungs and watertight fittings I had added. I'm a fan of flexible conduit and 14 gauge is much easier to pull through it than 12, but make sure you know your local code requirements (or have a licensed electrician do the work) if you are doing this. I have wired three outlets with this wire and haven't found any issues with it. I found it to be easily workable, strips like I would expect it to, and didn't find any flaws in it.

The Higoom wire is particularly easy to handle, far easier to use in tight spaces than stiffer wires, and the tinned copper core makes it very simple to solder, too. Having six colors to choose from to match the color of a splice or repair in car or trailer wiring, along with the included short lengths of shrink tubing, means that 12-volt system repairs can be nearly invisible. The perforated dispensing box is a nice touch for anyone who does such work at a single work station, though I don't think I'll be using that feature.

      "14 gauge wire|||B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ [2023-02-13] <b>Great quality automotive & marine wire</b> This is perfect wire for automotive use, including campers and marine applications. The conductors are fine stranded, tinned copper, which is a thin protective coating on the copper to keep it from corroding in harsh environments such as ocean areas, or auto applications where winter road salting can cause problems. Despite what other reviewers have said, this is indeed copper wire, but the “tinning” process makes the wire appear silver unless you look at the cut end. It is typically used with crimp connectors in most applications. There is no indication that this wire is UL listed, so I would not use it for home-wiring applications or any 120 volt (or higher) AC current. The silicone insulation and fine stranding make this wire very flexible, so perfect for sharp turns and pulling through tight locations like behind the dash. The 14 gauge that I used is good for any circuits of up to 10 amps unless they are longer than 25 feet or so. Remember to calculate for both positive and negative lengths, and whether you can afford any voltage drop in your circuit. Circuits for an automotive refrigerator or fog lamps, which have extended use times for example, are different than a circuit for a horn, which is only used for a couple seconds at a time.

When the package arrived some of the slotted caps had already slipped out of the wire nuts--they don't hold tightly to the nut. There don't appear to be any ridges that they pop into to keep them in place. And even once you put them back, once you put a couple wires in and start tightening, the slotted plastic is pretty stiff and they easily spin and fall out. The bigger problem is the nuts are only about half full of silicone--which is absurd. When you insert the wires and start turning, no silicone oozes out the end cap--so there's not even enough silicone in there to help keep the caps in place--so they easily pop off. If you're not careful about how much wire you strip, it's definitely not going to be sufficiently protected from the elements for a weather resistant connection. Honestly, I'll probably toss most of these out. My low voltage connections are not typically in places that are especially easy to access.

The thermostat wire problem is always caused by a person doing something wrong: stapling through the thermostat cable, shorting the conductors across a power transformer, crushing the thermostat wire cable between boards or vents, cutting the thermostat wire cable with a weed wacker, and etc.. Of course, I use a special staple gun that installs high arch staples that will not crush the thermostat wire cable. I run “loose” runs that can be “stretched” when necessary.

      "IP68 rated|||B0CJ3Y1BNQ ★★★★★ [2024-01-10] <b>Easy to use, waterproof 4 wire connector</b> This review is for 4 Pin IP68 Outdoor Waterproof Electrical Wire Connector for 5-12mm Wire Diameter, (Max 24A 450V) This connector separates into five pieces for installation of the wires to be spliced/connected. There are two mid pieces that contain a rubber sleeve. Two size sleeves are provided: 5mm and 12mm. They are squeezed by tightening the end caps to form a watertight seal on the exterior wire jacket. Note that the description of 5-12mm wire size refers to this outer cable jacket. The mid pieces screw together over the center section which contains the wire splicing block. It appears that up to 16 gauge wire could be used. Each wire is placed in a ferrule and is captured by a screw that is tightened such that the wire is pushed into the ferrule body, which contains a similar screw arrangement on the other side allowing two wires to be spliced/connected. The mid pieces screw over the center section and the joint is made waterproof by an o-ring on each side. They claim IP68, which means that the connection should not be continuously kept underwater. I tested the connector under a running faucet for 5 minutes and no water got inside. It should be fine in any rainstorm. I would not place it where it could be exposed to strong streams of water, such as in a pressure washer. The rating of 24A means no more than 6A per contact. If you use this for more than 50V, I would make sure that all strands on the wire are inside the ferrule and that the wire insulation goes right up to the ferrule to minimize creapage paths for high voltage. Overall, this is a very effective and compact way of splicing wires that will be exposed to weather. These were installed on the control cables of an amateur radio antenna system. I like their design and will buy more when the need arises.",

It is the standard for most applications. It cost the same as Southwire and less than Romex. If you have any doubt, this cable is, in fact: 1. Underwriters Laboratories Listed (UL) 2.

National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) compliant 5. Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) compliant 6. Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) compliant In the US, 12/2 is used on 20A circuits (14/2 on 15A circuits). On paper, on a 20A circuit, this cable can handle 2400W. However, the NEC has much to say (Article 210) about load limits under various conditions. BTW, one can use 12AWG on a 15A circuit instead of the money-saving 14AWG. The NEC does not disapprove but some inspectors will say no because it may confuse homeowners who see 12AWG wire in the control panel connected to a 15A breaker and change the breaker to a 20A breaker. Then too, some inspectors make it up as they go. Anyway, compliant 12/2AWG to satisfy most residential wiring needs."

I'm not sure the Amazon listing made it clear that this is UL approved, but it is. I measured the outside diameter at .225\", and peeling back the Rayon cover reveals a round white PVC jacket that is .210\" diameter. The PVC makes this cord rugged but also quite stiff compared to true antique (and less safe) cloth-covered cord that was usually just one or two cloth layers wound directly over the two individually-insulated conductors, but without the extra molded PVC jacket. Vintage cord used on lamps, radios, and other electrical devices usually was a little less bulky, more flexible and sometimes had an oval cross-section rather than round. This cord is well-suited for modern retro lighting and restoration applications where extreme flexibility and the ability to hang naturally under its own weight over short lengths is not a requirement. For greater flexibility, twisted cloth-covered cord is available from other sources. This has each PVC coated conductor individually wrapped in cloth and the pair of wires twisted together, yielding greater flexibility. Several years ago I had to buy cord like this for an antique replica that I built, and I paid a lot more buying it from an antique radio part supplier. This is a high quality product with safety approvals at a very good price. Highly recommended.",

      "UL listed cable|||B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★☆ [2023-06-05] <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again).",

      "ETL listed|||B0CSD3GJ53 ★★★★☆ [2024-03-08] <b>ETL listed, just like regular zip wire but 12 gauge</b> With spring headed our way, we're beginning to plan for some landscaping improvements in our yard, and low-voltage lighting is one of the things I'd like to add, so I picked up this wire. This wire looks like your typical lamp cord/zip wire, but at 12 gauge, this is pretty stout wire. Like zip wire, the two conductors are insulated in black flexible rubber insulation and joined by a thin section of rubber in the middle, so you can easily split the two conductors apart for making any necessary connections. And like typical zip wire, one of the conductors is identified by ribbing on the exterior of the insulation; this conductor is used, by convention, as the neutral wire. I've learned the hard way that before you put any wire into service, check it for breaks. Both conductors in this 100 foot spool passed the continuity test. What else is there to like? They include a chart (see photo) that shows the maximum wattage for any given length and gauge of wire, so it's nice to have that as a handy reference. It's also ETL listed (sort of like UL listed). For low voltage applications like landscape lighting, you could argue that being ETL listed is overkill, but it's a nice thing to have regardless since it is rated for up to 300 volts. One minor nit--I wish that they had length markings on the wire like some wires do--once you start using this, it's nice to be able to know how much length is remaining without having to unspool it and find it's not enough. Again, maybe overkill for a 100' spool but that would have been a really nice touch.",
      "UL Listed|||B0CN316VHN ★★★★☆ [2024-01-09] <b>Good for a wide variety of low voltage applications</b> First of all, note that this wire is intended for low voltage applications, including outdoors. The insulation is rugged PVC so it can be buried or exposed to wet conditions. It should not be used for 120v AC wiring. I confess that I intend to use this indoors for LED strip lighting, so the 16 gauge is overkill for me. I have complete confidence that my uses will be handled with no problem by this wire. The wire is sent on a convenient spool. One strand has smooth insulation and the other is ribbed for easily keeping the polarity right. The smooth strand has the labelling in white. The spool and the wire are both labelled as UL listed. I give it five stars because it is built for wet and outdoors conditions, and thus is more versatile.",
      "UL rating|||B0CGQ29J9Q ★★★★★ [2023-04-05] <b>Wow</b> This is really good premium wire. UL rating gives a peace of mind especially for critical applications. Insulation is really soft, and doesn't easily kink and hold memory like cheaper wire. Additional premium touches - you would think how many \"features\" could a cable have, yet here we are: 1. Rubber cable end caps, which I assume are meant to protect the cut copper ends from oxidizing over long periods of storage. 2. A velcro tie. 3. Low odor. At least compared to some cheaper wire, which can instantly stink up my entire room. Last but not least, this cable is made in Korea by a company that is itself compliant to very strict standards. So personally I automatically expect higher quality compared to a certain other country where most cables are made, and by every indication this meets those expectations. Highly recommended if you can afford the premium, and/or need it for critical applications that need to be standard compliant.",

I have read that silicone insulation has a better flexibility and heat resistance than PVC insulation, which sounds like this silicone wire will be a good choice for my project. Although great for my type of project, I didn’t see any marking on the wire (too small?) and no listing, labeling or certifications found in the product listing. It’s not such a big deal for hobby use, but sometimes it makes a difference, mainly in other than hobby use.

Rating scores may be revised at a later date if there is a reason to do so that was originally unforeseen. Thank you. 5-STAR = Much better than advertised and/or expected.

      "20 AWG|||B0C5T6BGR6 ★★★★★ [2023-01-29] <b>Great project wire for low voltage</b> I got this 20awg cable for 12v projects and the size is perfect for most of my low current power requirements. I wouldn't recommend 20awg to be used for 120v applications. 16awg is generally used for most household devices using120VAC . At 12 volts, (cars, boats, golf carts, etc) this wire can handle general low current applications. Low current for 12v meaning less than 60W/5.00A @ 12ft length or shorter. This cable is not tinned, so it is best suited for interior environments as this wire is not rated to be used where water and moisture can corrode the copper over time, reducing conductivity. The cable is easy to work with using a good set of wire insulation removers (Amazon won't let me post what they really are called). The name of the one I used in the attached video is \"Capri Tools 20010 Precision Wire...\". I've used them for a few years now and I'll never go without one again. Best $30 ever spent on wire tools.

The silicone jacket is immune to soldering temperatures with no melting or creep from the heat. The solid copper strands are tinned to prevent oxidation and to ease soldering. Working with high-flexibility and heat-resistant silicone wire is a treat compared to PVC-insulated wire, but the higher cost usually makes me limit its use to special projects where there is a great deal of repetitive flexing or where it is necessary to ensure that no stresses are imposed on the joint, such as when soldering to the pads of a circuit board. I would prefer to use silicone wire for everything otherwise. You can punch holes in the cardboard box and use it as a wire dispenser.

The quality of wire wasn’t as important for this so I didn’t mind taking a chance on an unknown brand. So far, this seems to be as good as anything I can source locally, and 10 cents a foot keeps the price competitive. I like the silicone jacket. It makes the wire very easy to work with. I was worried it wouldn’t hold up as well to the heat of soldering, but I was very careful and had no issues. It was too small to really use a crimp connector so I did mostly soldering and heat shrink. The tinned wire took solder well and I didn’t have any issues with connectivity or creating a solid connection. I didn’t have my calipers handy to check this versus other 20 AWG wire but it seemed comparable. Even so, sometime manufactures use more insulation and less metal to give it the impression that it is the same size. With wire I am unfamiliar with, I always size up against the standard AWG amp ratings just to be safe. It’s hard to say if the jacket will hold up to harsh conditions. For my purposes, it’s being used inside an enclosure and is well-protected. If you’re going to use this for automotive, marine or exterior projects, I’d leave a piece of wire outside for a while to test it before committing to a full project. Overall, a good value wire option if you don’t have a power hungry circuit where only the best will do.",

      "22 AWG (gauge)|||B01K4RPB3O ★★★★★ [2023-02-16] <b>Good quality, high strand-count high flexibility tinned wire with silicone rubber insulation</b> This 22 AWG (gauge) silicone insulated wire is excellent for indoor or protected environments where high flexibility/lack of stiffness, and non-melting (or at least melt resistant) insulation is required. The conductors are a 'high strand count\" type, meaning that instead of being comprised of just a few larger/thicker strands, it is instead comprised of a much greater number of smaller/thinner strands; and this contributes to its lack of stiffness/great flexibility. The other contributing factor to the high flexibility is that the insulation is silicone rubber, rather than the more common PVC (which is rather stiff). This kind of high strand count, silicone rubber insulated wire is exactly what high quality test equipment 'test leads' have been made of for decades. The silicone rubber is also much less heat sensitive than more common insulations such as PVC or \"machine tool wire\". It won't melt off as readily as PVC insulation does if your soldering iron needs to be held onto a joint or terminal for an extended period of time. The fine wire strands are also nicely tinned, and the insulation strips off easily and cleanly, and the stranded wire solders easily. It is a good quality product at an affordable price. HOWEVER, it is not the best choice for many common \"hook up wire\" applications, since its lack of stiffness can be an issue; the strands definitely need to be twisted and soldered in order to keep their shape enough to be formed into a hook before soldering around a terminal for example. This wire also does not want to cooperate if you want to twist a few of them together, because their limpness makes them uncooperative in that regard. And if you use this wire in \"hook up wire\" applications, it wants to just flop into some odd position rather than 'staying put' where you want it to be. Silicone rubber insulation is also not that great when it comes to abrasion resistance, and resistance to some kinds of oils and such where other insulations may be preferable.",

It is unshielded, with PVC jacket and insulation. There is no filler (like cotton rope or talc or anything) between the jacket and the conductors, so it does retain some shape memory -- which is neither good nor bad. It is reasonably-flexible and does straighten out easily-enough, just as I anticipated from the product photos. It came in a plain plastic bag as a coil of about 6\" diameter, secured by two zip ties. For a relatively short length of wire like this, this is very good packaging: It wasn't cinched down into a tight bunch with a hundred kinks to work out, or wound onto a little spool that would impart a tight spiral twist. It will be easy to use what I need while keeping the coil from getting too messy. The jacket and conductor insulation both strip off with a level of ease that is familiar from other wires that I've used professionally. I have no way of verifying the oxygen-free claim, but the conductor strands themselves appear to be (and act like) solid copper, not copper-clad aluminum like many inexpensive wires have these days. I anticipate that it will work very well. The jacket is wheel-printed with the following text: \"AWM 2464 22AWG 80°C 300V VW-1 AWM I VW-1 A 22AWG 80°C 300V FT1 ZHENFENG\"",

      "18 gauge wire|||B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ [2024-03-06] <b>A Comprehensive Starter Set for Electronics Enthusiasts</b> The 18 Gauge Wire Kit offers an excellent starting point for anyone delving into the realm of electronics, whether as a hobbyist or a budding professional. This kit is particularly appealing for its thoughtful compilation of essential wiring needs, presented in a user-friendly package. Variety and Quality: One of the standout features of this kit is the variety it offers—eight colors of 18 gauge silicone wire, each extending to 23 feet (7 meters). While the length of each spool might not cater to extensive projects, the assortment allows for ample experimentation and small-scale builds. The choice of silicone for the wire sheathing is a commendable one, providing a durable, heat-resistant covering that forgives the occasional soldering mishap, making it an ideal selection for beginners. Additionally, silicone's chemical resistance and flexibility are qualities that veteran electronics enthusiasts will appreciate. Accessories and Utility: The inclusion of color-coordinated heat shrink tubing and zip ties adds a layer of organization and professionalism to projects, enhancing the overall utility of the kit. While the wire stripper may not impress seasoned users, it's a valuable addition for those just starting, offering an all-in-one solution to basic wiring needs. Packaging and Design: The kit's packaging is notably well-conceived, featuring a box with holes for each wire spool, facilitating easy access and storage. This system helps maintain a clean and organized workspace, a boon for any project. However, the opportunity for improvement lies in the visibility of the remaining wire on each spool; a clear plastic window on the box would have perfectly rounded out the design by allowing users to gauge their wire stock at a glance.

What a deal... just perfect to both use and store, sits flat and doesn't take up much room and stacks well. Great start... The outside insulation jacket is a very thick PVC material, it wasn't real easy to cut so it shouldn't nick easily (think of a errant nick from using a wire staple). Even though it's a thick jacket, it's super pliable. The inside wire insulation both cuts and strips more easily than the outside and is easy to work with. I only hesitate saying a joy, because it sounds to corny... There's about a million different uses and projects that this wire would be perfect for, you'll certainly run out of wire before you run out of projects. It is NOT house wiring or electrical supply to anything... it's very small, 22 gauge is tiny.. In a house, it would be doorbell or maybe 'ring' style wiring (or alarm sensors), garage door buttons & sensors, not for lights or outlets, extension cords, etc..

A couple of the colors are a little off from what you would normally expect, but they are still close enough and easy to tell apart. The box has holes for easy dispensing of the wire and to keep it from unrolling everywhere. In the kit you also get a good assortment of colored heat shrink tubing and small zip ties so you can color match and make everything look all spiffy. The little wire stripper it comes with is actually pretty good and strips quite well. I like it because it is a great size to put in a compact tool kit like for a motorcycle, boat, car, or whatever you want. If you are like me and do a lot of DIY projects then this kit is a great thing to have on hand. I actually plan to get the 10AWG kit also for higher current projects.

The original wire is 18-gauge and looks near identical to this wire. Those worked without issues for over 30 years. This wire looks high quality. Hopefully, it’ll outlast my stay in this house. I’m also running some of this wire in-wall for controlling and delivering low-voltage power to several ioT devices. I could easily have used CAT5E or CAT6 cables for those applications.

With the affordable availability of high efficiency LED landscape lights, the need for 12 gauge cable is no longer there, unless the runs are extremely long. When the fixtures were pulling 20 to 50 watts, options were limited.

      "Correct gauge (18 AWG)|||B0C7T9YK2N ★★★★☆ [2023-10-24] <b>Supple yet strong, low-memory</b> As far as I can tell, this is some good wire. The gauge is correct (I measured it with a wire gauge tool). The wire retains a little memory, so if you kink it, it will unkink on its own, but you'll be left with a mark from where the tight kink used to be, unless you make an effort to smooth it out again, which it does nicely. The silicone insulation is highly heat resistant. I took a torch lighter to it and applied a direct flame for several seconds. The insulation held up well. The only indication it had been torched was that the insulation lost its color and turned white, but the structure of the insulation itself was undamaged. Very cool stuff for high temperature applications. I might try some of this for winding some transformer coils (BALUNS) for ham radio, though it might be a little tricky to keep it holding its shape. This wire is better suited in applications like probe leads and jumper wires (with alligator clips at each end for example, for diagnostic work in a hot engine compartment, or for splicing a line where that line may end up in contact with a source of heat). The insulation is tough stuff. It does not pinch easily, but strips nicely. In appearance it looks like fine stainless steel but a hint of copper color under the light is visible in a cleanly cut end and it solders well, so although I am not a chemist, I would say it's a safe bet that this is in fact, tinned copper. You get a number of small spools in a nice assortment of colors. The spools have predrilled holes in the flanges so you can keep the spool from unwinding.",
      "18 gauge wires|||B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ [2023-09-09] <b>Outstanding value!</b> This cable is an outstanding value! Between the 4 conductors in the cable, you get 400ft of wire for $50 right now. Naoevo also included a whole whack of zip ties and heat shrink tubing which is an excellent inclusion to help with your wire install. The outer layer is a kind of thin rubber or plastic sheathing. It doesn't feel super strong, but it'll keep your wires organised over long runs. It'll also look better than 4 loose wires. The wires themselves are true 18 gauge and helpfully color coated to ensure you get your connections in the right place. The outer sheathing is a little bit annoying to strip away since it's so stretchy, but if you cut it vertically with your wire cutters, then clip off the verticle strips, you can get 'er done. The individual wire insulation is easy to strip and work with though. As far as the application for this kind of wire, I used this to have a clean run from my home theater receiver out to my rear channel speakers. Keeps the four wires nice and clean for the long main cable run, then you can strip back the outer sheathing where you need to connect the speakers themselves. This would also be excellent for car applications. This stiffer wire is easier to push through the car interior than single floppy wires are. All in all, as said at the start, this is a great value for all that wire and the included install gear. If you need versitile wire at a great price, this is for you!",

      "18 gauge wire|||B0CV7XP7JN ★★★★★ [2023-11-22] <b>True Marine Grade Tinned Copper Wire</b> So I really wanted to find out what makes good wire. Turns out there’s a few factors when determining a quality wire. 1. Copper is better than aluminum, as (semi) precious metals such as silver, gold , platinum etc. are superior, however, cost prohibitive. 2.copper should be bright and 3. The wire jacket should not show any wear or distinguishable defect with the heat of a cigarette applied to it. Makes sense for scenarios when a fire may be present especially on motor vehicles. 3. Must exhibit moderate to good flexibility. 4.the shielding must be smooth throughout. If not, that means the wire has not been produced be acceptable standards. Unevenness of the wire core may create sliding within the shielding due to looseness created. In my testing this wire meets all these requirements with only a slight mark off for slight mark left after the cigarette test. I think that this is adequate wire for anyone’s build requiring 18 gauge marine grade wire. The tin coated copper is even and well applied. The copper is on the rigid side, however, acceptable for good quality in terms of flexibility. I don’t think you would be disappointed with choosing this, especially, if your other choice is cheaper copper clad aluminum.",

      "20 gauge wire|||B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ [2023-06-30] <b>Great for DIYers and reasonably priced for copper with silicone insulation</b> The price for copper wire has gone up so dramatically in the last few years, I did a lot of rewiring in my house a few years back and a spool of 12/2 1000 feet Romex was $260 and now over $500 a roll at Lowes or HomeDepot. The prices for these spools are cheaper than similar PVC coated wires at Walmart for 20 gauge wire and these have more expensive silicone coating and tinned copper. Price wise these are very good wires and good for small projects or repairs on electronics. The wire is very flexible and good for replacing cheaper wires in outdoor equipment that are subject to the elements or chemicals. The silicone is good for almost degrees 400F which is great for power and heating equipment as they are more chemical resistant and won't melt as easily. I have two outdoor portable water heaters used for camping and the wiring on the units use the cheaper PVC and the insulation can melt when the heaters are used for extended periods.

The wire is of good quality and it has met my expectations. One of the main reasons I purchased this wire was for its length. The 40FT wire is long enough to cover the entire length of my LED strip lighting project and it provides enough slack to make the installation process much easier. The 2pin 2 color red black cable also makes it easy to identify the positive and negative wires, which is very helpful during the installation process. The red and black color coding also helps me to keep track of the connections and ensure that everything is connected properly. The 18-gauge wire is also thick enough to handle the current of my LED strip lights, which I found to be a big plus. It ensures that the wire can handle the power and prevents any potential overheating or damage to the wire. The only downside to this product is that the wire is a bit stiff, it's not very flexible which can make it a bit difficult to bend and shape to the desired position. But it's a small price to pay for the quality and durability of the wire. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the TYUMEN 40FT 18 Gauge 2pin 2 Color Red Black Cable Hookup Electrical Wire for LED Strips.

Cost is always a consideration when working on projects. What is CCA wire? It’s a copper cladded aluminum wire, meaning that the outer layer is coated with copper while the inner core is aluminum. How does CCA work? The copper clad aluminum isn’t going to have the same conductive or durable performance as a pure copper, but it is pretty good. What’s to like? For non mission critical projects, the advantage of a CCA wire is cost as it is less than the cost of pure copper. What’s not to like? It’s not as durable and it has a higher resistance than pure copper. In conclusion, if you’re working on lots of non mission critical low voltage projects, the CCA wires can be a great cost saving while still getting decent performance.

      "18 Gauge|||B0CN9FNFZC ★★★★★ [2024-01-28] <b>Nice well made cable</b> Nice highly flexible 18 gage wire. It is tinned, so if you plan to solder, that is even better. I am using this as a signal wire from remote/pendant mounted switches to control small relays. For this, it is well suited, possibly a little overkill. But I like having a little heavier gage than what it takes just to get the job done. In my experience, it lasts longer and more forgiving to unexpected issues and faults. The outer sheath is not terribly difficult to cut, but I do not think average use will cause damage to it. Probably not suited to use in a manufacturing plant where it would be subjected to many types of abuse. But for the average DIY home entrepreneur, it would likely be just fine. I think we all take better care of things when it is us who foot the bill to pay for them. The individual wires are color coded (think thermostat wire), so they are easily identifiable on each end. As mentioned they are tinned, so the are easily soldered as well. I like soldered connections. They are more trouble to install, but, when properly done, I feel they are extremely reliable and with lower resistance due to more surface contact area. Soldering is not always an option, but these wires will do just fine when crimped as well.",

Buying wire in short rolls is not your most economical way to get it but having a variety of colors is nice and buying large rolls can get expensive quick. The wire has a soft, silicon, insulation that is easy to strip and extremely flexible. It is stranded wire and made up of a large number of tiny strands. The description says a hundred, but I didn’t count them. Lately I’ve been bitten by people selling aluminum wire as copper, so I stripped a short piece and looked at it under my microscope to verify it is copper. The kit includes a simple stripper tool, I wouldn’t count on using it for much, and an assortment of cable ties and heat shrink tubing in a variety of colors. All useful stuff.

Looked at and tried many types and they were never flexible enough to give me the comfort that they wouldn't bind or have the wires break inside. This stuff flexes so well that it can be routed easily and definitely will clean up the wiring, it even maintains it's path and doesn't flop to the side so it won't need anything more than a strand of filament to keep it inline and away from motion parts. I can run all 3 fans, thermistor, and 3 wire LEDs in this one cable with all their individual wires hooked up. If you run even a cheap breakout toolhead and deck pcb with a common ground you can add in the 5 BL probe wires into it and only have your servo cable and heater wires separate in the sleeving, which they should be anyways due to size/current differences. All this in a 6mm or so package. I did tidy wiring before but could never get all the wires to less than 11-12mm and they were always lumpy and didn't flex well binding up my toolhead on certain movements. This will help me get it down to less than 10mm diameter in total. If i upgrade to a board system i'll definitely come back to see if there's a cable with the proper number i need to keep all the low voltage in one. Only thing that would make this perfect is to have multi gauges in it but that's custom cabling and i don't need 50,000 ft of it.",

I myself got the kit because although I have lots of wire in my workshop, most of it is \"reused\" wire from otherwise discarded items, and I don't really have an assortment of colors available to color-code different circuits (which gives a nice neat appearance plus makes it easier to understand the function of different circuits if/when maintenance on them is required up the road). There are a total of eight different colors in this kit, which includes the commonly-used red, black, green, white and yellow. The quality of the wire is really good, with soft and very flexible insulation that's easy to strip, and tinned copper that won't tarnish and potentially cause issues in the future when being soldered. There are some nice bonuses included in the package as well, which although they are mentioned in the product ad I somehow failed to notice until the box arrived and I had a nice surprise. These is a selection of heat shrink tubing and plastic wire ties that match each of the 8 colors of wire. Also included is a little stripping tool.

The new thermostat needed the additional wire for the \"C-wire\" to properly power the thermostat because it's a smart thermostat. Before you start make sure you need 6 strands, some may need more or less. You may not need a new wire. The install was pretty simple but could be wildly different for you depending on how it's wired. For me, I just cute the old wire at the thermostat, taped the new wire to it overlapping about 6 inches and then went to the basement to pull the old wire bringing the new one through. Since all the holes mine went through were good size it went through no problem. Since it's such a small wire (compared to electrical), hopefully yours is, too. You'll need some basic wire cutters and trimmers. If you've never done this before it's pretty easy but you should probably watch a YouTube video and practice on an end of the wire you can cut off. Don't want to expose any of the copper wire and cause a short. The wires are all the same regardless of color, that's for your benefit to differentiate them at the thermostat and furnace ends. Make sure you're very meticulous about this. Be sure to power down your furnace before starting there. Check YouTube for guides. In the process I blew a fuse on my furnace and got the blinking light, 5 times.

      "22 AWG wire gauge|||B0CWNBZ164 ★★★★★ [2023-09-05] <b>It's as awesome as wire gets. Good price. Pleasant to work with.</b> There's just not a lot to say on this. It is flexy and easy to work with. It doesn't tangle/bulge internally and it coils sensibly. My wire gauge confirms it's 22awg. I plan to use this in my hobby of LED lighting controllers where this works well to send data, ground, and +VDC (5, 12, 24) to the strands from each transformer. I was pleased at the way this is packaged. Instead of being on a spool that explodes with released tension when uncoiled, this is on a larger plastic spool that's easy to \"tie off\" for reuse and very closely matches (coincidence?) the spools that LEDs come on, allowing them to live harmoniously in a box or standing on end in a file cabinet. The sheath strips nicely. The wires tin well. The cable doesn't sproing into a garage door spring at pressure when released from the package to use. It's a good price. If you need wire at the specifications listed, it's hard to go wrong here. While there are a number of variables involved, the required math is pretty straight-forward. 22G is about 43.4 ohms per km or 0.0434 ohms.per meter. Your project may not be running all channels at max brightness on all bulbs (RGB...and sometimes W) at the same time or it may be doing so for only a fraction of a second. Doing it for hours inside a packed conduit is different than an air-gapped conduit or being in the open. Just doing some quick math, let's imagine a 241 WS2812 project (like a Hexagon or a short strip) where each bulb is pulling .60ma per bulb (full intensity, white, and eye-torching white ON) That's a 14.5 W fixture at 24V, so you can use 22 gauge wire like this to drive 283feet and still lose only 1VDC at 24V. (It's worse at low voltages - this is why you want high voltages if wire length matters. It's the reason the power company lines to you are at 10's of thousands of volts....) If you're just doing boosters into taps, I'd imagine the distance to be even longer. 22Gauge is a good tradeoff of \"easy to work with\" and \"enough copper to deliver your electrons without resistance\" (hahahhaa. Ohm's Law jokes never get old.) I also did a spot test on painting it and it seems to take paint acceptably well. Some of this spool is probably going to end up in a permanent fixture that's tucked/painted into a corner of mine. This cable seems to be everything it claims to be and a nice set of specs for consumer lighting. Not fusable strands. Not chunky/expensive solid copper. Recommended.",

Needed wire to run through the attic from the LED strips to a controller about 22 feet away. Wanted something heavier than the 22 gauge wire you find everywhere, and I wanted 100 foot spool Those two combinations limited what was out there. Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white).

This wire is perfect for low voltage applications, such as automotive wiring, LED strips, lamp lighting, and marine projects. Therefore, I am giving it a five-star rating. The wire is made of high-quality 18 AWG stranded PVC cord, which provides excellent flexibility and durability. I have found that this flexibility makes it easy to route the wire in tight spaces and around corners without any issues. Additionally, the stranded construction ensures that the wire is resistant to breakage and can withstand the rigors of demanding applications. The tinned copper conductors are another great feature of this wire. The tinning process adds a layer of protection to the copper, making it more resistant to corrosion and extending the lifespan of the wire. This is particularly important for marine applications, where exposure to moisture and saltwater can be a concern. The 18/2 wire configuration, with two conductors, is suitable for a wide range of electrical projects. It allows for easy connection of various components, such as LED strips, lamps, switches, and more. The wire is color-coded, with one conductor in red and the other in black, making it simple to identify and connect the positive and negative terminals correctly.

I first lit up my landscape back in the high wattage halogen era, so I have previously used 12 AWG cable and multiple transformers to light limited areas. With the affordable availability of high efficiency LED landscape lights, the need for 12 gauge cable is no longer there, unless the runs are extremely long. When the fixtures were pulling 20 to 50 watts, options were limited. The 2 to 12 watt LED fixtures I am installing currently are working with this 18/2 cable, so there is no need for 12 gauge overkill, unless you are concerned with voltage drop over 50-100 feet runs.",

So, I hopped on Amazon to find a good replacement/upgrade. I was originally looking at 5-wire cables (after all, that's all I really needed), but then I saw this 18-gauge, 8-wire cable for just a few dollars more and decided to go with it instead. This would provide a degree of future-proofing (such as adding a whole-house humidifier, extra sensors, or the like in the future). This 18-gauge, 8-wire cable was thicker and stiffer than my old 20-gauge (?), 4-wire cable, and thus a bit trickier to pull through the wall from the thermostat to the furnace (be sure to check your cable path first to ensure it will fit (width of thru-holes, radius of bends, etc.). But, I just taped one end of the new cable to the old cable, crossed my fingers, and started a pullin'. Thankfully, with a bit of elbow grease, it worked! It looks and feels high quality and came in ample length for my needs (and then some). I used a 'Uxcell a10073000ux0031 2 Pcs 8 Position Double Row Screw Terminal Covered Barrier Strip 600V 25A' to connect the new 8-wire cable (right) to the existing furnace wiring (left).",

I tested the wire's resistance and per the American Wire Gauge (AWG) Table, I should get 6.4 ohms resistance per 1000 feet of 18 gauge wire. I don't have a multimeter sensitive enough to measure just 23 feet of wire as in this kit, but my multimeter was bouncing between .1 and .2 ohms. Right in the ballpark of .14 ohms for 23 feet that I calculate I should have. Sorry I didn't have enough hands to measure the wire and get a picture too. I also held the wire over a flame for several seconds. The insulation stood up just fine without and visible damage to the wire. The wire itself is very flexible and I like the silicone insulation. I didn't think too much of the little wire stripper/cutter included in the kit. But, it will work if you don't already have proper tools. The little zip ties are handy, but so few won't last too long! One more thing is I thought the kit is a little spendy for what you get. But, if you need several colors of wire, but not much of it, this may work for you. Better than buying several larger rolls that you don't end up using most of. Overall, a solid product that I can recommend, given the above comments. In my book, a solid 4 star product, very useful and a quality product. But, nothing too special.

I tested the \"slotted end\" of the included stripper pictured. Pressed it down on the wire at 90 degrees on a hard surface at 3/8\" from wire end. Pulling the wire out gave a clean strip with no damaged strands. A good buy!",
      "18 gauge wire|||B07T19567J ★★★★★ [2023-11-08] <b>Reliable and Durable: 18/6 Thermostat Wire for Various Applications\"</b> I recently purchased a 50-foot roll of the 18/6 Thermostat Wire in brown and am thoroughly satisfied. It's made of solid copper 18 gauge wire with six conductors, ensuring excellent conductivity and durability. The wire is CL2 and CMR Riser Rated (CL3), making it suitable for both residential and commercial use. Its UL listing adds to the trust in its quality and safety. Installation was straightforward, and the wire has been performing flawlessly in my thermostat setup. It's a great choice for anyone in need of high-quality, industrial-rated thermostat wire."

I found it best just to use a sharp knife, carefully cut around the insulation, then make another cut from there, parallel to the wire, to the end of the cut wire, then you can remove the insulation without losing any strands.

No fault to the seller or product, Amazon had the “order this + this + this” option for the end connectors and clamps, which you’ll also need, but it gives you a wrong size for the end clamps. The 3/4” mounting straps are the right size, but 3/4” ends to secure this 6/3 MC cable to your metal boxes is way to big. I ended up having to make a trip to the hardware store to buy smaller 1/2” end clamps instead of the 3/4” ones Amazon was recommending. I love working with MC cable, but its always a pain trying to determine the correct size anti short bushings, end caps, mounting straps etc to go with it. The sizes are all over the place depending on the gauge and number of wires and none of the sellers actually specify what size additional parts are needed to match up with it. As a side note, its also always confusing how sometimes it’ll state (for example) “6/3 wire” where you’d expect it to be three #6 wires total but in reality there are 4 wires, black, red, white and green. There isn’t always consistency in this, sure would be a lot easier if the standard was to count the actual number of wires, including the ground. This 6/3 MC cable in particular is actually four total 6 AWG wires, black, red, white, green for those that aren’t sure. It’s also rated for up to 55 Amps, which is perfect for wiring in a 50 amp RV, Dryer, or Oven outlet. Even if say your dryer outlet only requires 2 hots and a ground (6/2) with no neutral (old style), go ahead and run this (6/3) wire anyhow and just don’t use the extra wire, you’ll be doing yourself a future proof favor for the day when you replace that old appliance and discover the new one requires all 4 wires. Easier, and cheaper to just not use the extra wire now than trying to add another wire later.",

Then I just fed back the extra wire until the plug was mounted. Gotta plan accordingly so you retain the wire sheathing at the connector if you do it that way. Finally had a use for my hex sockets when torquing these. Highly recommend mounting it in the box and pulling the plug back out and retorquing because I did that by chance and found I could get a little bit more tight in the connections. 6/3 wire is no joke.

I putter around with offgrid solar power and battery setups, have several at home in addition to my grid-tied system and like to help friends set their own systems up as well. For that you really need some good heavy high-quality copper wire, because once you get the system down to 12 or 24v, you need to pull quite a few amps to power reasonable-sized inverters, and that means thick copper, and sometimes multiple strands of it. I create my own power cables using copper crimping ends, sometims with two parallel 4AWG lenghs used in parallel as a single cable, and kept as short as feasible. This cable works well for that. It’s reasonably flexible and seems to take the power just fine. I consider copper to be a precious metal; won’t be all that long until it costs a lot more than it does now, because the ore grades are falling inexorably around the world, it’s getting more energetically remote. So I think of owning spare high-quality copper wires as an investment for the future just like gold or silver, only a lot more useful and a lot cheaper. This is a good example of very useful copper cable, recommended to those setting up solar panels and inverters.",

However, I haven't re-tensioned the first roll at all since stringing a bunch of lights three years ago. One run is 53 feet with 50 lights on it. I needed something like this because it's ruinous to the light string to put any meaningful tension directly to a string and so you have to support the string on something like this. Don't bother with cables as that's huge and expensive overkill and they're hard to terminate. Don't use poly or fabric line; they WILL sag. If you have problems with the wire keeping some of its curl, that's absolutely normal. It's coiled steel! Add much tension and then back off a bit. Remember that light strings have a significant straightening effect. If it's snarling when you try to unwind it, most likely you're uncoiling from the outside, not the inside end. Been that way since they invented the stuff a few centuries ago. OR you can unroll it from the outside end after mounting it like a wheel to a horizontal bar (F-clamp, broom handle or pipe propped in a step ladder, and such)."

      "pre-stripped and soldered wires|||B08TB4BVV9 ★★★★★ [2021-10-06] <b>1920s look without the risk of actual 1920s wiring.</b> It never looks right to restore an older electrical device with new AC cord. The trick then is finding fabric-wrapped cord that is safe and at least has the appearance of electrical cord from the 20s and 30s. Luckily, a variety of providers have arisen over the past few years. Here we have one where most of the work has been done for you, with the AC plug already connected. Now there's no question that this is a contemporary AC plug, and if you're doing a genuine restoration, you probably won't go this route, but there's also no question that this is a safe approach and one that is probably going to be hidden by furniture anyway. In this case, the fabric wrap covers two independently insulated wires, already stripped and soldered and ready to be wired directly into your device, lamp, appliance, etc. The fabric has a nice sheen and looks great; I picked the brown color to go with a copper lamp - works perfectly.",

The stranded copper conductors are tinned, and the ends already have a dab of solder. I'll be using heat shrink crimp connectors, so trimmed off the soldered tips. The PVC sheathing on this wire is smooth and I was able to easily pull it through a conduit to replace an old wire with just some electrical tape joining the ends. Tested with a light drawing 2 amps, and only detected a .3V voltage drop across the entire 50 foot coil. Sold as 12V low voltage wire, but rated for 300V. I like that this wire is rated for direct burial and waterproof, so long as it remains undamaged. It's easy enough to slide this through some conduit or at least sections of old garden hose or something to make it more durable and resist chafing. The PVC sleeve is somewhat loose and the individual wires can be removed from short sections fairly easily. Not very flexible, but easy enough to bend. The price point is typical for similar products, but I see a 20% discount is currently offered, making it a good bargain for a good product.",

I bought this product as I only needed about 15' to finish a project - the length was right and was far cheaper then anything else I found online or in store (HD, CTC, HH - Canada). UL rating should be fine in Canada. 1st - this wire is a much lighter wire and insulation then what should be the equivalent 12/2 NMWU. 2nd - the ground wire is molded into the sheathing making it difficult to separate and strip your hot and neutral wires (black, white). 3rd - this wire feels more rigid then 12/2 NMWU, making me wonder about copper content. And finally, this wire is rated for 600 V where 12/2 NMWU is rated for 300 V (as is 14/2 NMD90) - this does NOT change the Amperage rating. - so not sure why. Above is 14/2 NMD90 (top), UF-B 12/2 (middle) and 12/2 NMDU (bottom). I don't know if this is standard in the US, but as noted in previous review, the 25' seems inadequate.",

You generally don't want to go over 75-80% load on a circuit so if you had a car charger that was 30 amp draw, you'd want 8 gauge wire instead. A number of years ago wire makers switched from round style 3 conductor jacket to this flat 3 conductor jacket. I found the old stuff a little easier to work with. I would recommend rolling out this wire, don't feed from the center of the roll. That will make pulling it through stud holes easier since the wire will be straighter.

      "12-gauge wire|||B0BYNNJS8B ★★★★★ [2023-11-04] <b>Good Quality, High Temp Wire</b> I work on a lot of electronics requiring 12-gauge wire and recently procured this wire for a couple of my projects. I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful.",

This wire looks like your typical lamp cord/zip wire, but at 12 gauge, this is pretty stout wire. Like zip wire, the two conductors are insulated in black flexible rubber insulation and joined by a thin section of rubber in the middle, so you can easily split the two conductors apart for making any necessary connections. And like typical zip wire, one of the conductors is identified by ribbing on the exterior of the insulation; this conductor is used, by convention, as the neutral wire. I've learned the hard way that before you put any wire into service, check it for breaks. Both conductors in this 100 foot spool passed the continuity test. What else is there to like? They include a chart (see photo) that shows the maximum wattage for any given length and gauge of wire, so it's nice to have that as a handy reference. It's also ETL listed (sort of like UL listed). For low voltage applications like landscape lighting, you could argue that being ETL listed is overkill, but it's a nice thing to have regardless since it is rated for up to 300 volts. One minor nit--I wish that they had length markings on the wire like some wires do--once you start using this, it's nice to be able to know how much length is remaining without having to unspool it and find it's not enough. Again, maybe overkill for a 100' spool but that would have been a really nice touch.",

      "14 gauge|||B0CPPWBGT8 ★★★★★ [2024-03-26] <b>Heavy duty 2-conductor wire!</b> I love this kind of wire! It's two wires, essentially, with a protective PVC sheathe. I love this stuff because it removes the need for corrugated PVC split-loom. The sheathe acts to protect the wires against abrasion, and if you're running wire in vehicles, with all of their tight turns and sharp edges, you need abrasion protection. I got this to run accessory LED lighting for my Jeep, but I'm considering it for running speakers as well. The individual wires are 14 gauge, which is more than enough for my craziest lighting project. 14 gauge can handle a lot of juice. Overall, this is good wire. For the price you get a decent length, and if it behaves like others of its kind, should last a long, long time.",
      "12 gauge wire|||B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★★ [2024-04-22] <b>premium wire</b> This is really premium wire. Its so incredibly flexible, I love silicone jacketed wire. Not only is it flexible, but my soldering won't scorch the silicone like it will PVC jacketed wire, as silicone has a much higher tolerance for heat than PVC. I tested the resistance of each of the two strands, and both came back exactly 1.2 Ohms resistance, which means two things. #1, most importantly, the wire is not broken internally in either strand, there are no opens. #2, my volt meter is consistently lousy and at least measures off the mark twice equally. What I mean by this is that at this length, according to spec, there should be 15.88 milliohms (mΩ) of resistance in 10' of 12ga copper wire, which is far too sensitive for my cheap meter to measure. So I don't know why my meter is reading 1.2 ohms, but my guess is that is not exactly correct, and the actual resistance is functionally closer to 0 ohms. Anyway, this wire is perfect for chaining together a few LiFePO4 12V batteries in parallel for a solar-charged power station I'm building. Just got to crimp some spade terminals on and it will be perfect for my project. Also, LOL at the brand name... Dastard?? lol really?",

It is widely used in dry, hidden (not exposed), interior locations and is commonly referred to as Romex (invented by Romex in 1922 and listed by the NEC in 1926). It is the standard for most applications. It cost the same as Southwire and less than Romex. If you have any doubt, this cable is, in fact: 1. Underwriters Laboratories Listed (UL) 2.

National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) compliant 5. Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) compliant 6.

However, the NEC has much to say (Article 210) about load limits under various conditions. BTW, one can use 12AWG on a 15A circuit instead of the money-saving 14AWG. The NEC does not disapprove but some inspectors will say no because it may confuse homeowners who see 12AWG wire in the control panel connected to a 15A breaker and change the breaker to a 20A breaker.

Someone said it was aluminum core, but that is not true. It is TINNED COPPER which gives the color of aluminum unless you look at the cut end of the wire. Then, you can see it is definitely copper core. You could also measure its resistance. It measures 0.031 ohms resistance in 30’. That’s equivalent to 1.033 ohms per 1000’. The standard for resistance of 10-gauge copper wire is 1.018 ohms per 100’ @ 25° C. Aluminum wire (10-gauge) is 1.649 ohms @ 25° C. My reading was at 24° C. Therefore, it’s copper wire. This wire is extremely flexible because of its silicone insulation and the extremely fine wire strands that make up the wire core. That makes it easy to work with and very desirable.

The 14 gauge dead soft copper round wire on a spool is good (very good quality, packaged well, speedy delivery, etc,) but due to a mistake on my part, I should've taken into consideration that even with dead soft wire, any copper wire larger than 18 gauge should be coiled. It's just so much easier to straighten. I could anneal it but that's extra work and cleaning I don't want to deal with so I should've spent the extra 3 bucks on their website for a coil with 10 extra feet of wire. Again, this was MY FAULT because I didn't want to spend $3 extra because I thought it would potentially be ok on a spool but it's much harder to straighten the kinks out.

The 14 gauge of this wire is hefty enough that I'm sure it's carrying a decent signal, and yet thin enough that it doesn't fray when attaching to my equipment. The outer sleeve is the perfect consistency as well, and the inner wire is \"loose\" enough inside that when cutting the outer sleeve there's little danger of also cutting the wire. It also cuts extremely easily, meaning no scoring multiple times trying to get to the wire inside. The insulation on the wires seems like standard insulation, not the gel-type thick insulation found on other brands of speaker wire. If you do a lot of wiring, this is key as a standard wire stripper works great with it - a real time saver.

Pain in the royal tookus to smash into the deepest metal box with a stand-off plaster faceplate but it became a lot easier when I pulled the wire through a bit and worked on wiring the plug with slack and cutting each wire to a specific length from the 3/4 connector so the wire didn’t have to bend when mounting the plug. Then I just fed back the extra wire until the plug was mounted. Gotta plan accordingly so you retain the wire sheathing at the connector if you do it that way. Finally had a use for my hex sockets when torquing these. Highly recommend mounting it in the box and pulling the plug back out and retorquing because I did that by chance and found I could get a little bit more tight in the connections. 6/3 wire is no joke.

The high temp insulation makes it nice for soldering, it doesn't shrink off or split out from the heat of nearby soldering - and the temp range is also low (cold). I didn't test it, but the low end spec is -76F.. (So obviously I'd have something special around to make any claim about testing it anywhere near that.)

      "14 gauge wire|||B0CSD35PQT ★★★★☆ [2024-03-05] <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone.",

      "10 GA|||B0CMTTT3PR ★★★☆☆ [2024-01-19] <b>There are no ratings, UL or otherwise, on this cable</b> Ok, so I guess it really depends on what you are doing as to how happy you are going to be with this cable. If you are doing nothing more than running speaker wire, then good for you. You should be happy with the cable. If you are running power wire for an appliance, a solar system, or for any standard project other than low voltage battery, you will have to pause and wonder. What is the voltage rating? What is the current rating? Is this really OFC or something else? You can think it is something, but you will NOT know for sure. If you have an inspector ask for the ratings, you are out of luck and will have to rewire your project. The company says that it is 10 GA Oxygen free copper and they say the rating on the insulation is 200V. So, the problems start when you look at Silicon insulation and find that the normal low voltage rating is 600V up to 35,000V. 200V does not appear in any standard. Most oxygen free tinned copper still looks like copper when you cut it. This cable does not do that, even with a magnifying glass. So, how do you know? Nothing on the cable indicates that it is OFC or anything other than 10GA. Ok, once you get that resolved in your mind, this cable is designed like lamp zip cord except it splits way too easily. Great concept, but you will need to secure the cable ends somehow if you do not want it pulling apart. You can use electrical tape, shrink tubing, or even a tie wrap not pulled too tight. The cable itself is very flexible, like you would expect from a silicon wire. For use in a solar system where there is NO ground and you are required to install a breaker on both the negative and the positive side of the supply, this type of cable works very well. In fact, it is the project I started using it on until the Building inspector asked to see the data sheet on the wire or at least the UL number. Since I could not produce it, I had to remove what I had done and switch to a UL rated cable. Does that make this a bad product? No, it only makes it a quesitonable product since you do not know exactly what you have. I have not been able to find a way to directly contact the company to ask for a spec sheet.

I've been using very similar wire, and will be using this wire, for primary power on my larger RC planes. The tinning and fine stranding make it easy to solder into various connectors and the flexibility allows this relatively large conductor to be easily tucked away inside my models. The high temperature rating of the insulation ensures that it can handle the heavy, usually short-term amperages that today's advanced RC battery and motor technology demand. I also like to use this wire for various other hobby projects where flexibility is required for making or breaking plug-in connections. It can withstand a lot of flexing due to both the fine stranding and the thick. but soft. silicone insulation. The wire is marked at regular intervals with conductor size and insulation temperature ratings. It is not listed, nor is it appropriate for building wiring.

The wire is just a (very) little bit stiffer than what I would expect with full copper stranded but the difference is very minimal and could also be due to the wire sheathing as well.

This is more than enough to bury under my gates and entrances. The advantage of using this wire is that I can bury it under all driveways and walk through gates and not worry about it being harmed over time. When I open a gate the electric fence can stay energized around the entire property without breaking the connection. Those spring loaded handles you use to break the wire and open a gate often rust out and fail. I will still use these to energize the gate itself but now I know the rest of the property is energized while I come and go. And I also have enough of this wire left over to run ground wires to my experiments and projects in my electronics lab. At only 56 Ohm per mile it will make a very solid ground."

Someone said it was aluminum core, but that is not true. It is TINNED COPPER which gives the color of aluminum unless you look at the cut end of the wire. Then, you can see it is definitely copper core. You could also measure its resistance. It measures 0.031 ohms resistance in 30’. That’s equivalent to 1.033 ohms per 1000’. The standard for resistance of 10-gauge copper wire is 1.018 ohms per 100’ @ 25° C. Aluminum wire (10-gauge) is 1.649 ohms @ 25° C. My reading was at 24° C. Therefore, it’s copper wire. This wire is extremely flexible because of its silicone insulation and the extremely fine wire strands that make up the wire core. That makes it easy to work with and very desirable.

Be sure you know what you're buying. This is ultra flexible, with many super-fine strands and silicone rubber insulation marked 200C (higher than PVC but lower than PTFE). The fine strands (150 of them, but I didn't count!) can be a bit of a challenge when crimping contacts... make sure no microscopic strands escape the crimp -- then it works great. The insulation is thick but soft: very easy to work with but also easily damaged if used in the wrong application. It's the right cable for routing in tight locations, since it's so willing to bend and lay flat... good for DIY drones (flexing arms or retracting legs) or making wiring harnesses that need to flex but are well protected from abrasion and pinching. For more rugged high-temp insulation, consider PTFE but it is much more difficult to work with and hard to find at a reasonable price. As noted by others, some colors are a bit off. Red is clearly orange, and blue is gray-purple. That's okay for my purposes, but maybe not if you are building to a print for assemblies that will be inspected.

The pro is that it is very fine stranded, thus it is very flexible. But the insulation is is very hard to strip without losing strands. Tried first with wire strippers, didn’t work, insulation wouldn’t slide off wire. I found it best just to use a sharp knife, carefully cut around the insulation, then make another cut from there, parallel to the wire, to the end of the cut wire, then you can remove the insulation without losing any strands. Because the wire is so finely stranded, it is difficult to insert under a clamp type screw connection, unless the connection is rated for two wire sizes larger than the wire gauge size.

I started to make a cable with it and noticed the two wires split very easily, too easily. With only moderate use this wire will keep separating. The ends should always have a piece of heat shrink tubing at the ends to prevent it from becoming two wires, even when storing. That is partially an effect of the insulation being so flexible. From the picture you can see how many small flexible strands there are. I measured one with my caliper and the reading was 0.002 inches. This is really nice wire to work with because of the extreme flexibility. I took a piece of insulation and hit it with my soldering iron set to 593F.

I have looked very closely at it for flaws and found none. One conductor is all red and the other has a black stripe on it. I am rewiring the compressor side of one of my Heat Pumps which requires 10 gauge wire as it draws 30 amps @ 120v. It's only a 7' run from the disconnect box so I can cut the wire in half and use one of the conductors from the second half as a ground. It's going in conduit so weather, elements and critters are of no consequence. Still, it's good to know I'm using very good wire.

I was just trying to round out my stock a bit as I already had some 10, 14 and 16 awg silicone wire around. I tend to order BNTechGo as I tried them once and was plenty happy with it. This stuff seems just as good as far as I can tell. My main concern was if it was real tinned copper or not so I stripped a section and scraped it with a sharp knife until I could clearly see the copper start showing through the tin. So yes, this is definitely real copper. The strands are extremely fine, which is great for flexibility but can make it tough to strip without cutting some. But that's the case with all flexible silicone wire, so no real issue there compared to other brands. These 10' sections came in just loose coils in a resealable pouch, which I guess is fine given how short they are; normally I prefer spools. All in all this wire seems just as good as other more established brands and costs less. Works for me."

This kit is just what I was looking for. The wire itself is okay. The sheathing is strange, not like any wire I have handled before. The page claims it is silicone so that might be why. The strands the wire itself is made of are very thin. This makes it hard to strip the sheathing off of without also pulling out some strands. My automatic strippers were too strong to strip this so I had to do each wire manually. The included heat shrink tube is cheap. It does what it is supposed to do, shrink, but it is very plastic-y and not flexible. Not bad for a cheap wire kit, but I was expecting more.",

      "Micro-fine strands, about the thickness of a human hair|||B0BWY3JGGV ★★★☆☆ [2023-03-15] <b>Difficult to work with, especially for beginners.</b> The silicon sheathing makes for a very flexible wire. You do have to ensure that you are using the proper gauge stripper or you will break some of the center conductors. The center conductor consists of micro-fine strands, about the thickness of a human hair. This makes the wire even more flexible, but can be a pain in the ass when using especially for those that are new to soldering/prototyping. It can be easy to have a stray strand inadvertently short our components/connections. When tinning the wire, you have to be extra vigilant with any stray strands."

It is widely used in dry, hidden (not exposed), interior locations and is commonly referred to as Romex (invented by Romex in 1922 and listed by the NEC in 1926). It is the standard for most applications. It cost the same as Southwire and less than Romex. If you have any doubt, this cable is, in fact: 1. Underwriters Laboratories Listed (UL) 2. National Electrical Code (NEC) compliant, 3. ASTM International (ASTM) compliant (formerly known as American Society for Testing and Materials) 4. National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) compliant 5. Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) compliant 6. Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) compliant In the US, 12/2 is used on 20A circuits (14/2 on 15A circuits). On paper, on a 20A circuit, this cable can handle 2400W. However, the NEC has much to say (Article 210) about load limits under various conditions. BTW, one can use 12AWG on a 15A circuit instead of the money-saving 14AWG. The NEC does not disapprove but some inspectors will say no because it may confuse homeowners who see 12AWG wire in the control panel connected to a 15A breaker and change the breaker to a 20A breaker. Then too, some inspectors make it up as they go. Anyway, compliant 12/2AWG to satisfy most residential wiring needs."

Both are 10 gauge OFC with silicone insulation. The other brand - a speaker wire, not temperature rated - melted (and you can see some tiny solder blobs on the resulting groove). The Bntechgo insulation did not melt and was a bit thicker. Add in the extra fine tinned stranding and you have a very substantial product in my opinion.

Each wire comes on it's own individual plastic reel, but they are not labeled. The actual wire sheathing IS labeled with the wires size and capacity. Speaking of the wire sheathing, it is very SOFT, leading to a wire that's very flexible but at the cost of abrasion resistance. You can easily strip the sheathing from the wire with your finger nails. The box of 6 colors I ordered came with a small number of small colored zip ties that correspond to each color of wire in the box, a very nice touch.",

      "Stranded wire|||B0CK4WHWBY ★★★★★ [2023-12-09] <b>Reliable and Durable Outdoor Wiring Solution</b> One of the standout features is its robust construction. The wire is encased in a flexible PVC jacket that not only makes it durable but also ensures it is waterproof, oil-proof, and UV-resistant. This is a crucial aspect for outdoor installations, providing peace of mind that the wire can withstand various weather conditions without compromising its integrity. The 18-gauge thickness is perfect for low voltage applications, such as LED lighting and automotive speakers. The stranded design adds flexibility, making it easy to work with and allowing for smooth installations even in tight spaces. Additionally, the direct burial capability is a notable advantage, eliminating the need for conduit in certain situations. I found the cable easy to strip and terminate, making the installation process straightforward. The overall build quality instills confidence in its longevity, and I appreciate the attention to detail in its design. In summary, the 18 Gauge Electrical Wire has proven to be a reliable and durable solution for outdoor lighting projects. Its waterproof and UV-resistant properties, combined with the flexibility of the stranded design, make it an ideal choice for anyone seeking a high-quality cable for low voltage landscape lighting and other outdoor applications.",

      "Finely stranded wire|||B0CSD35PQT ★★★★☆ [2024-03-05] <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone.",

I also purchased some 18 AWG 2 conductor wire made by a different manufacturer. The outer diameters of this 16 AWG is smaller then the 18 AWG wire, meaning that the heavier gauge (16 AWG) wire has a thinner outer insulation sheath to protect the inner conductors.

      "Individual strands pre-tinned|||B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ [2024-01-30] <b>Appears to be true 16ga wire (unlike some others)</b> I've bought other similar spools of multi-conductor cable, and I've learned that you have to be careful about what you're getting. In one case, I ordered a 50' spool of 18 gauge wire that turned out to be a good 20% smaller, giving 20% higher resistance. So -- the first thing I wanted to check on this wire was the resistance of a single conductor through the length of the whole spool. Granted, I haven't unwound it to measure its length, so I'm taking that part at face value. The principle here is that any copper wire of a certain cross-sectional area (i.e. gauge) will have a given resistance per foot. There are many free online wire resistance calculators that will tell you just what the total resistance should be, when you provide it with the length and wire gauge. In this case, 50' of 16ga wire should be 0.201 ohms. As you can see in the photo, that's exactly what I have, within the precision of the meter I was using. It was actually flipping occasionally between 0.19 - 0.21 but typically sat on 0.20 ohms, which is pretty firm confirmation that this is, in fact, 16ga wire. Having confirmed that fact, I'm happy to recommend this cable for all intended purposes. The individual wires are easy to strip, have thick insulation, and the black outer sheath is sturdy and slick. Within each 16ga wire, the individual strands are pre-tinned, which gives much better corrosion resistance for when you're working in a wet, or otherwise corrosive, environment (like on a boat's wiring or other marine environment).

Needed wire to run through the attic from the LED strips to a controller about 22 feet away. Wanted something heavier than the 22 gauge wire you find everywhere, and I wanted 100 foot spool Those two combinations limited what was out there. Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white). Even with my current strips, would have been nice to be able to upgrade without having to re-run wire. Oh well, happy anyway!",

Stiffer in a colder outdoor environment. I did not measure the length to confirm advertised 165 ft though. Conductor appears to be pure copper strands, which is as claimed, not copper coated aluminum. The individual strands are quite fine. I counted 64 strands after stripping. Makes it very flexible and not likely to break after many and extreme bends.

But you weren't expecting a mainstream brand anyhow, and it's just outdoor low voltage wire. It's fine. Looks like it will hold up in the garden. - One thing to keep in mind is that because it's bare copper wire (not tined, like marine wire) the connections are subject to corrosion from moisture and humidity. Make sure to use a connector method that either bonds the ends (solder) or creates a waterproof barrier to prevent this. - At the time I ordered the 16/2 165ft roll was $41, making it an okay deal, considering it's generic wire. - Hope this helps",

Mostly the thing I like the most is how flexible the wire is. Describing how flexible I would have to say it’s as flexible as a cooked spaghetti noodle. The extreme flexibility takes all the stress off of my 12v switches. All of the other wires were so stiff they pulled on the switches due to how the wires hung or which way the wire was going. This caused the switches to sometimes not stay in place on the panel or the wires could work themselves loose or could pull off at times. I typically am using 12 and 14 gauge wires due to the high watts of many of the led lights I use and even the 12 gauge silicone wires are as flexible as a cooked spaghetti noodle. Now you can’t get this wire to twist together when attaching two of them due to the extra fine wires in it but that’s where the extremely easy soldering really comes in handy. I solder the ends and then use heat shrink tubes and end up with a much cleaner job."

I wasn't looking forward to raw fingers from twisting all of those wire nuts tight so I purchased this to see if it helped with the job and all I can say is \"WOW\"! I have it chucked into my 1/4\" impact with the torque turned down to keep from over tightening and this is a game changer on make up. It fits the red and yellow wire nuts with wings fine and that's probably 95% of what I'm using. After a while using this it's easy to just listen and tell when the wire nuts are tight enough. A fast reverse to check and make sure all the wires were captured in the nut and another spin tight and I'm done. I should have added one of these to my work tool collection a long time ago!"

I have attempted to use a Stingray on two different jobs, two different ceiling grids, and it just pops off as soon as you start to pull wire.

      "Storage channel for stand stacking pins|||B0CL4QNJKB ★★★☆☆ [2024-01-08] <b>Half Finished</b> The plastic seems robust and strong with a claimed load carrying capacity of 330 lbs when used as directed for holding spools of wire or sitting on it as a stool. Regarding directions, they are excellent. Written in clear, concise, and informative American English. The way the two halves nest together for carrying and each stand have carrying hands on 3 sides makes carrying them convenient. Unfortunately, while they got lots right, the product feels half baked; while it can be very useful now, hopefully the next version will correct some of the following shortcomings. The location on the rack for storing the stand stacking pins does NOT work, because the channel where they go is wider than the pins' diameter, so they just fall out. In other words, there is no mechanical catch or other device to hold the pins in their storage location. This problem could have been easily fixed with four small 3/8 to ½ inch button magnet, one pair at each end of the two storage channels. A quick search shows that four rare earth magnets would add only slightly more than 1 cent ($0.0125) to the materials cost of the product. My other initial concern is will the ¾ to 1 inch conduit or rigid pipe they recommend for suspending spools of wire between the supports stay in place if the wire is pulled off the spools at an angle toward either support vs perpendicular to the support pipe and parallel to the supports or will the pipe slip out of the hole in the stand.",

They are color coded for size, which will correspond with a color dot on your crimper for proper crimping. They can be hit with a heat gun to provide a better seal, but they work fine with just a crimp if you don't need the additional seal. The various wire connectors are most excellent.

I bought the 50 foot spool of thermostat wire for that project from a big box store. This item’s packaging, in contrast, comes in a cardboard box of significantly smaller dimension than the big box store’s spool of wire, which was in a clear plastic bag. As seen in the photo, the box is maybe 5 inches square and about a couple inches tall. I gave some thought to this. If I were an HVAC contractor, I think the smaller footprint of this item’s design would be a better approach for easy storage when in the field. But the downside to this is the wire’s coiled memory may make fishing the wire a bit more challenging than the wider diameter of the big box version. Aside from this interesting but probably trivial difference, this item seems perfect for its intended purpose. It strips well with the usual wire stripper tools. Continuity was verified with all five conductors. The conductors’ colors match industry standard. Coming from the aforesaid DIYer here, I guess you can take that with a healthy grain of salt :) but I think we’re on page that this the right design for thermostats needing five conductors.

The sheathe acts to protect the wires against abrasion, and if you're running wire in vehicles, with all of their tight turns and sharp edges, you need abrasion protection. I got this to run accessories in my Jeep, including light pods, a light bar, speakers, and various gadgets I have running through my cab. I like this stuff because all of the wires stay contained, which reduces a lot of the mess when running wire. If you're making an amp board for your vehicle, for instance, having fewer wires running around gives you a much cleaner install. Wire like this is good for this. The individual wires are 16 gauge, which should be plenty to handle the power draw of LED lighting. Overall, this is good wire. For the price you get a decent length, and if it behaves like others of its kind, should last a long, long time.",

No fault to the seller or product, Amazon had the “order this + this + this” option for the end connectors and clamps, which you’ll also need, but it gives you a wrong size for the end clamps. The 3/4” mounting straps are the right size, but 3/4” ends to secure this 6/3 MC cable to your metal boxes is way to big. I ended up having to make a trip to the hardware store to buy smaller 1/2” end clamps instead of the 3/4” ones Amazon was recommending. I love working with MC cable, but its always a pain trying to determine the correct size anti short bushings, end caps, mounting straps etc to go with it. The sizes are all over the place depending on the gauge and number of wires and none of the sellers actually specify what size additional parts are needed to match up with it. As a side note, its also always confusing how sometimes it’ll state (for example) “6/3 wire” where you’d expect it to be three #6 wires total but in reality there are 4 wires, black, red, white and green. There isn’t always consistency in this, sure would be a lot easier if the standard was to count the actual number of wires, including the ground. This 6/3 MC cable in particular is actually four total 6 AWG wires, black, red, white, green for those that aren’t sure. It’s also rated for up to 55 Amps, which is perfect for wiring in a 50 amp RV, Dryer, or Oven outlet. Even if say your dryer outlet only requires 2 hots and a ground (6/2) with no neutral (old style), go ahead and run this (6/3) wire anyhow and just don’t use the extra wire, you’ll be doing yourself a future proof favor for the day when you replace that old appliance and discover the new one requires all 4 wires.

      "Four wires in the sleeve|||B01KWBPC7M ★★★★★ [2020-06-04] <b>Very decent wire. In depth review & Pics</b> Running some permanent LED strips in the living room vaulted ceiling. Needed wire to run through the attic from the LED strips to a controller about 22 feet away. Wanted something heavier than the 22 gauge wire you find everywhere, and I wanted 100 foot spool Those two combinations limited what was out there. Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white). Even with my current strips, would have been nice to be able to upgrade without having to re-run wire. Oh well, happy anyway!",

I joined two of the conductors together to form a 200-ft loop for a resistance test and it measured 0.9 ohms (after subtracting 0.1 for my test leads). That’s about right for 16 AWG wire. And I love how they included heat shrink to protect your crimp points. This is for low voltage applications, as indicated in the product title. I realize that (at least at the time of this writing) the product description claims it can handle up to 600V, but I’m fairly certain it’s not UL listed for that to comply with electrical code. If you want to run full line voltage outdoors without conduit then you should be looking for UF-B wire and there are rules about how deep you have to bury it (usually one foot at the very least — and that’s assuming you have ground fault protection). This product is either for low voltage landscape lighting (12-24V) or telecommunications. You don’t normally need four conductors for lighting, but I’ll leave that to you to figure out.

Between the 4 conductors in the cable, you get 400ft of wire for $50 right now. Naoevo also included a whole whack of zip ties and heat shrink tubing which is an excellent inclusion to help with your wire install. The outer layer is a kind of thin rubber or plastic sheathing. It doesn't feel super strong, but it'll keep your wires organised over long runs. It'll also look better than 4 loose wires. The wires themselves are true 18 gauge and helpfully color coated to ensure you get your connections in the right place. The outer sheathing is a little bit annoying to strip away since it's so stretchy, but if you cut it vertically with your wire cutters, then clip off the verticle strips, you can get 'er done. The individual wire insulation is easy to strip and work with though. As far as the application for this kind of wire, I used this to have a clean run from my home theater receiver out to my rear channel speakers. Keeps the four wires nice and clean for the long main cable run, then you can strip back the outer sheathing where you need to connect the speakers themselves. This would also be excellent for car applications. This stiffer wire is easier to push through the car interior than single floppy wires are.

It sure doesn't make it easy to work it around the normal bends of a car environment. I needed to use this for my AC Epicenter (since it's such a low voltage draw). I didn't need to buy and install a distribution block as I'm running a single 5 channel amp, so I preferred to run from the front for power. After fighting with its stiffness, I gave up and just ordered a MUCH better 3 conductor from Crutchfield. World of a difference. So if you're ok with the ridiculous stiffness routing it through your car, it seems like a decent enough cable for low voltage and current. If you're like me and prefer accessories to help ease the install process, I'd pass it up. Not fault of the vendor, as it arrived super quickly. Had I not began using it, I'd return it.

      "3 conductors|||B0C27YYCXK ★★★★★ [2023-10-15] <b>3-conductor stranded copper 22AWG wire</b> I needed some small 3-conductor wire for a project and I think this will do nicely. It is unshielded, with PVC jacket and insulation. There is no filler (like cotton rope or talc or anything) between the jacket and the conductors, so it does retain some shape memory -- which is neither good nor bad. It is reasonably-flexible and does straighten out easily-enough, just as I anticipated from the product photos. It came in a plain plastic bag as a coil of about 6\" diameter, secured by two zip ties. For a relatively short length of wire like this, this is very good packaging: It wasn't cinched down into a tight bunch with a hundred kinks to work out, or wound onto a little spool that would impart a tight spiral twist. It will be easy to use what I need while keeping the coil from getting too messy. The jacket and conductor insulation both strip off with a level of ease that is familiar from other wires that I've used professionally. I have no way of verifying the oxygen-free claim, but the conductor strands themselves appear to be (and act like) solid copper, not copper-clad aluminum like many inexpensive wires have these days. I anticipate that it will work very well. The jacket is wheel-printed with the following text: \"AWM 2464 22AWG 80°C 300V VW-1 AWM I VW-1 A 22AWG 80°C 300V FT1 ZHENFENG\"",

It's acceptable but not great. 4 STAR - I am very comfortable recommending it to a friend because it is is well made, durable, and delivers on its advertised features, and I would buy it again. 5 STAR - I really love it. The item exceeds my expectations of quality, durability and functionality. Not only would I purchase it again, but I would also actively encourage friends and family to do the same.

Be sure you know what you're buying. This is ultra flexible, with many super-fine strands and silicone rubber insulation marked 200C (higher than PVC but lower than PTFE). The fine strands (150 of them, but I didn't count!) can be a bit of a challenge when crimping contacts... make sure no microscopic strands escape the crimp -- then it works great. The insulation is thick but soft: very easy to work with but also easily damaged if used in the wrong application. It's the right cable for routing in tight locations, since it's so willing to bend and lay flat... good for DIY drones (flexing arms or retracting legs) or making wiring harnesses that need to flex but are well protected from abrasion and pinching. For more rugged high-temp insulation, consider PTFE but it is much more difficult to work with and hard to find at a reasonable price. As noted by others, some colors are a bit off. Red is clearly orange, and blue is gray-purple. That's okay for my purposes, but maybe not if you are building to a print for assemblies that will be inspected. The velcro wraps keep each spool neat, and the box is good for organizing these spools when lots of other wire spools are around.",

The wire is nice and flexible, even with the durable jacket. This wire features 8 different color conductors, black, white, red, yellow, blue, green, orange, and brown. After stripping the jacket back and revealing the conductors, I noticed the conductors seemed to be a little smaller than the true 18awg wire I am familiar with. As mentioned in another comment, this seems to be the case with this particular wire, as proven by another reviewer's wire resistance test. The following is printed on the wire's jacket. ESHENG PAL STYLE249743SP 2464 18AWG 80°C 300V VW-1 I A 18AWG 80°C 300V FT1 TRIUMPHCABLE Overall, this wire seems to be great wire for many low-voltage, low-current applications where an extra level of protection is needed such as automotive LED lighting, marine LED lighting, etc. Although the wire doesn't seem to be a true 18awg wire, it will function well for a wide variety of applications, assuming the wire is not expected to carry the full 18awg current.",

      "80°C rating|||B0C27YYCXK ★★★★★ [2023-10-15] <b>3-conductor stranded copper 22AWG wire</b> I needed some small 3-conductor wire for a project and I think this will do nicely. It is unshielded, with PVC jacket and insulation. There is no filler (like cotton rope or talc or anything) between the jacket and the conductors, so it does retain some shape memory -- which is neither good nor bad. It is reasonably-flexible and does straighten out easily-enough, just as I anticipated from the product photos. It came in a plain plastic bag as a coil of about 6\" diameter, secured by two zip ties. For a relatively short length of wire like this, this is very good packaging: It wasn't cinched down into a tight bunch with a hundred kinks to work out, or wound onto a little spool that would impart a tight spiral twist. It will be easy to use what I need while keeping the coil from getting too messy. The jacket and conductor insulation both strip off with a level of ease that is familiar from other wires that I've used professionally. I have no way of verifying the oxygen-free claim, but the conductor strands themselves appear to be (and act like) solid copper, not copper-clad aluminum like many inexpensive wires have these days. I anticipate that it will work very well. The jacket is wheel-printed with the following text: \"AWM 2464 22AWG 80°C 300V VW-1 AWM I VW-1 A 22AWG 80°C 300V FT1 ZHENFENG\"",

It has 8 conductors and a very thick PVC jacket. The strands are of tinned copper (See image where I scratched off the tin coat). Colors on the strands: White, Black, Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Yellow, Brown. There is plenty of chalk when removing the outer sleeve. Chalk is used to keep moisture out, which makes it less combustible. It's not riser rated though.

It's exactly as described on the listing. Keep in mind that this is stranded wire and the jacket is a bit thick. It's very flexible, so it does work as a thermostat wire although overkill. Because it's stranded, it's not as quick working on it as a solid wire. So not ideal as a thermostat cable, but a quality cable regardless.",

The cable is also marked 10AWG, 600V, and 105 degrees Celsius. So, this wire should be more than enough for anything you should need it for absent using it to wire your home to a fuse box because there is no ground wire. As someone else mentioned, it is much thicker than you'd want to use for a car. If you're just doing LED lights or the like, you wouldn't need this thick of a gauge. But, it's also nice to have it for when you do need thicker wire.",

Like a lot of wire I work with, it doesn’t take solder natively, and I have to dip the wire end into my flux paste to get them to tin but honestly this is pretty standard practice. Can’t complain about colors on same spool since it was completely obvious that’s what I was buying. Overall I’m very happy with this wire but it doesn’t do too well against the soldering iron. If you accidentally touch a wire with the iron, the coating easily melts away. That’s really my only complaint.

This wire will char very quickly if you use a small butane torch as a heat source. I intentionally lit some of it on fire to see what would happen and it extinguished itself very quickly so I feel like it's safe to use in most applications. The wire itself is really nice, it's surprisingly flexible for a 4 conductor wire and the strands are tough enough to take some bending without breaking off.

When it comes to outdoor, 12v landscape lights, you need to properly size the cable for the circuit. To do that, you take the number of lights you want to have on one circuit, and multiply by the number of watts. Nowadays, a typical LED type, 12 v light is in the 3 to 5 watt range. This is solid copper (the good stuff) 16 gauge cable, so it can handle up to 13 amps (which is about 1,500 watts!) but voltage does drop over distance. So this could easily handle one of the outdoor lighting kits or if you just want to add some more lights. (Old style, incandescent lights are a different story) 100% pure copper, direct burial, can't get much better than that, especially at this price",

I do more crimps than solder joints so I can’t speak to how this wire takes heat. The jacket seems durable enough for most purposes. I don’t know how it will hold up to four seasons of weather if it’s not protected from wind, rain and UV rays. It carried current consistently without any loss of power with minor stress testing of the circuit.

I only have two issues with this and would probbaly have dinged a 1/2 star if that was an option: I measured one of the rolls to see if I was getting 20ft, and it came up about 4 inches short. This isn't too bad for 20ft, but I expect to get every inch I paid for. Now maybe some of the other rolls were longer, but I didn't verify. If that is the case then they need to be more consistant. The second issue involves using the box as a \"dispenser\". THere are holes in the back of the box to feed the wire. The problem is if you put all 6 spools in side by side, then there isn't enough room to close the lid or for the spools to spin. They came packed with the spools in a 2x3 configuration instead of the 1x6 configuration you would use for dispensing. This is because they don't fit otherwise. Looks like good wire. So if you dn't mind being shorted a couple of inches, and don't need the dispenser to work well with 6 rolls of wire, and otherwise this is a good value for you, then this is your product.

      "16 gauge wire|||B0C9H1G52F ★★★★★ [2023-10-10] <b>Works well - Good value</b> All copper products have gotten to noise-bleed pricing of late. Even running low voltage wire is just ridiculously expensive especially if you run to one of the home stores. Ad frankly , if you're ordering wire without knowing what it is or seeing/feeling it, it can be a little scary as the quality varies so much. This wire arrives on a wooden core. Okay - that makes 500ft of heavy a little heavier, but you know they care about their product. It's also probably the only way to ship it so it doesn't end up as a bundle of knotted wire when it arrives in your standard Amazon box which in my case was shipped through UPS and clearly had a tough ride. But 500 feet of wire is pretty heavy at about 22 lbs on a 10x10-ish core. And the wire made it fine with a nice sheet of cardboard wrapped around the wire in between the core ends. The box clearly won over whichever UPS employee was fighting with it. The wire just feels like quality. It''s a firm, yet flexible outer sheath holding the two separate strands of 16 gauge wire. The sheath is UV resistant and rated for direct burial. It's UL listed and RoHS rated. It seems like a quality product and for purposes it's great. My use case is extending an existing low voltage run along the side of the property of the house to the back and introducing low voltage lights to the back yard. In southern Florida, the groundwater is high, the weather humid, and the sun hot. What better test ground for this? Anyhow it's ultimately gonna be buried under landscape rocks yet above landscape fabric in most places. Others will be direct burial In certain spots known for puddling. I expect no issues given the quality of this wire. And at 16Awg I expect it to be able to carry the 12 volts I need without concern. Highly recommend.",

      "16 gauge wire|||B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ [2024-01-30] <b>Appears to be true 16ga wire (unlike some others)</b> I've bought other similar spools of multi-conductor cable, and I've learned that you have to be careful about what you're getting. In one case, I ordered a 50' spool of 18 gauge wire that turned out to be a good 20% smaller, giving 20% higher resistance. So -- the first thing I wanted to check on this wire was the resistance of a single conductor through the length of the whole spool. Granted, I haven't unwound it to measure its length, so I'm taking that part at face value. The principle here is that any copper wire of a certain cross-sectional area (i.e. gauge) will have a given resistance per foot. There are many free online wire resistance calculators that will tell you just what the total resistance should be, when you provide it with the length and wire gauge. In this case, 50' of 16ga wire should be 0.201 ohms. As you can see in the photo, that's exactly what I have, within the precision of the meter I was using. It was actually flipping occasionally between 0.19 - 0.21 but typically sat on 0.20 ohms, which is pretty firm confirmation that this is, in fact, 16ga wire. Having confirmed that fact, I'm happy to recommend this cable for all intended purposes. The individual wires are easy to strip, have thick insulation, and the black outer sheath is sturdy and slick. Within each 16ga wire, the individual strands are pre-tinned, which gives much better corrosion resistance for when you're working in a wet, or otherwise corrosive, environment (like on a boat's wiring or other marine environment). Nice product, exactly as claimed.",

Before you start make sure you need 6 strands, some may need more or less. You may not need a new wire. The install was pretty simple but could be wildly different for you depending on how it's wired. For me, I just cute the old wire at the thermostat, taped the new wire to it overlapping about 6 inches and then went to the basement to pull the old wire bringing the new one through. Since all the holes mine went through were good size it went through no problem. Since it's such a small wire (compared to electrical), hopefully yours is, too.

My methodology for Vine Program products is to give a more thorough -- often product-destructive -- review. If I like the product, I buy my own version of it, otherwise, it gets donated post-testing. I also may include my opinion on the product's value proposition to the market. REVIEW: -------------------------------- If I was to give a description that people might be able to reference, I'd say this feels like the power cord you'd find on a high-end power tool. It's thick, and doesn't have a strong odor (common in cheaper products). Each comes with some zipties and a few pieces of heat-shrink if you need it. Inspection of the individual wires does seem to indicate tinned copper (instead of tinned aluminum), but I'd need a better device to really tell. At slightly over ~$1/ft, it's not a bad deal if you just need it in a pinch for a project.

Well, decades later I am experienced and educated about thermostat wire cable. Very, very, rarely is the problem caused by bad thermostat wire cable itself. The thermostat wire problem is always caused by a person doing something wrong: stapling through the thermostat cable, shorting the conductors across a power transformer, crushing the thermostat wire cable between boards or vents, cutting the thermostat wire cable with a weed wacker, and etc.. Of course, I use a special staple gun that installs high arch staples that will not crush the thermostat wire cable. I run “loose” runs that can be “stretched” when necessary.

They even took the time to strip off about 2 inches of the outer jacket on either end of the cable and then stripped the ends of each individual wire. So good job to them for recognizing that presentation matters. The outer jacket is just a sleeve, it's not bonded to the wire like many others. I doubt that this is burial grade and the listing doesn't say that it is.

      "Sturdy and slick black outer sheath|||B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ [2024-01-30] <b>Appears to be true 16ga wire (unlike some others)</b> I've bought other similar spools of multi-conductor cable, and I've learned that you have to be careful about what you're getting. In one case, I ordered a 50' spool of 18 gauge wire that turned out to be a good 20% smaller, giving 20% higher resistance. So -- the first thing I wanted to check on this wire was the resistance of a single conductor through the length of the whole spool. Granted, I haven't unwound it to measure its length, so I'm taking that part at face value. The principle here is that any copper wire of a certain cross-sectional area (i.e. gauge) will have a given resistance per foot. There are many free online wire resistance calculators that will tell you just what the total resistance should be, when you provide it with the length and wire gauge. In this case, 50' of 16ga wire should be 0.201 ohms. As you can see in the photo, that's exactly what I have, within the precision of the meter I was using. It was actually flipping occasionally between 0.19 - 0.21 but typically sat on 0.20 ohms, which is pretty firm confirmation that this is, in fact, 16ga wire. Having confirmed that fact, I'm happy to recommend this cable for all intended purposes. The individual wires are easy to strip, have thick insulation, and the black outer sheath is sturdy and slick. Within each 16ga wire, the individual strands are pre-tinned, which gives much better corrosion resistance for when you're working in a wet, or otherwise corrosive, environment (like on a boat's wiring or other marine environment). Nice product, exactly as claimed.",

      "No branding on jacket|||B0CF55452S ★★★★☆ [2023-11-05] <b>Low voltage landscape copper wire</b> 16/2, 165ft - This is a competent product: labeling on the jacket says direct burial underground, and the insulation is relatively flexible at room temperature for stripping and bending. Stiffer in a colder outdoor environment. I did not measure the length to confirm advertised 165 ft though. Conductor appears to be pure copper strands, which is as claimed, not copper coated aluminum. The individual strands are quite fine. I counted 64 strands after stripping. Makes it very flexible and not likely to break after many and extreme bends. See photo. - Was easy to strip. - Actually the product seems fairly generic: there is no branding printed on the jacket nor any identification label on the roll. But you weren't expecting a mainstream brand anyhow, and it's just outdoor low voltage wire. It's fine. Looks like it will hold up in the garden. - One thing to keep in mind is that because it's bare copper wire (not tined, like marine wire) the connections are subject to corrosion from moisture and humidity. Make sure to use a connector method that either bonds the ends (solder) or creates a waterproof barrier to prevent this. - At the time I ordered the 16/2 165ft roll was $41, making it an okay deal, considering it's generic wire. - Hope this helps",
      "Doesn't slide as smoothly as big brand ones|||B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★☆ [2023-06-05] <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again).",

      "Outer insulator not bonded to inner wires|||B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ [2023-11-21] <b>Nice Long Roll...</b> I picked this up for the 1001 projects I'm working on, what was a benefit for my project but might be a drawback for others is that the outer insulator is not bonded to the inner wires... I like this because when needed I can easily remove the outer sleeve and get 4 individual wires without much work, and it also seems to allow the cable more flex... The presentation when opening the package was really nice, with two velcro straps holding it in a nice coil, the outer sleeve cut back a few inches and the wires stripped on both ends... The bag with several small pieces of heat shrink and some nylon zip ties was a nice addition...",
      "molded jacket over lines|||B0CQP4KJM4 ★★★★★ [2024-03-28] <b>Perfect for LED lighting</b> This is exactly what I needed to hook up some LED lighting. The jacketing isn't just a loose sleeve like other wiring that you get at the store, it's actually solid rubber molded around the wires. This makes it good for automotive and outdoor use. I only regret not getting a longer length.",
      "Outer protective jacket|||B0CN768S54 ★★★★★ [2023-12-16] <b>Perfectly suited my needs!</b> I only needed to use the inner colored wires for a model car I'm working on, so I had to cut into the outer protective jacket to remove them. The jacket is very tough and thick, so it protects the 5 inner wires well. The individual wires were also very easy to solder. As a nice bonus, they include a few large zip ties as well as several pieces of heat shrink tube, which I will definitely use as well!",
      "Outer protective jacket|||B0CV7XSN9H ★★★★★ [2023-11-22] <b>Satisfying First Impression, Seems built to last</b> This wire seem like it should hold up for use on trailer LED lighting application very nicely. I'll certainly update the review if it doesn't. Passes basic continuity check with my DVOM. Wire strands seem to be tinned copper, as advertised, and the strands themselves feel thick and solid, much better feeling than the standard, easily broken, 4 color type trailer wire that's typically used for basic trailer wiring. The outer jacket is molded directly around the cluster of inner wires, as pictured in the listing, giving the whole thing the feel and flexibility of a well made heavy duty extension cord.",
      "molded jacket over lines|||B0CQP4KJM4 ★★★★★ [2024-04-09] <b>Good wire, nice price</b> I'm glad to have some 16 awg wire around for projects. I also like that the jacket is molded over the lines and it's not just crammed into some generic loom. I like the ease of use of soldering to tinned ends; it makes the soldering process work really well. The white covering looks like it belongs on a boat and I guess sometimes that's great and other times it won't matter."

Thoroughly enjoy using it... so I purchased the 2 core for power injection and can't even express how dissatisfied I'm am. The sheathing is to big for the wires, so you literally pull the wires out of the sheathing when trying to strip. It makes it almost impossible to shrink sleeve splices. Terrible product.",

Only thing is they advertize the wire sheathing to be centered not like other products but unfotunately that is not the case. I could not use my strippers for this as it cut through the interior wire sheathing. Ended up having to use a knife and carefully going around cutting/ bending the wire to make sure I didnt cut through.",

      "Oversized outer protective layer|||B07MCF1BMP ★★★☆☆ [2022-12-27] <b>A very strange product. I would take 'outdoor rated' with a grain of salt</b> TL;DR version: If you intend to use this cable in an outdoor environment, I would look elsewhere. I have used several spools of this company's 3 conductor wire for various projects and it has worked out well. The conductors are not undersized, and the outer cable sheath is properly tough. So I decided to give their 2 conductor wire a try. It turned out to be a very oddly constructed 2 conductor cable. My biggest issue is that the outer protective layer is MUCH bigger than required. It is literally the same outer sheath size as the 3 conductor cable I have used often - it literally appears that they just pulled one conductor out of their 3 conductor cable, put it on a reel, and sold it. This is not great for a couple of reasons: 1) The cable is thicker than it needs to be (not space efficient), so anyone working with limited space for their wire runs, or wire runs that are visible (like low voltage outdoor LED lighting), may want to look elsewhere. 2) This stuff says it is outdoor rated. However it is outdoor rated for UV exposure only. Because there is so much empty space within the outer jacket, anyone wanting to use this outdoors in damp climates or around water (irrigation wiring, landscape lighting, etc) should realize that the outer jacket is going to rapidly fill up with water (and stay filled), causing several types of issues: - Electric issues: any minor wire scrapes or damage could result in hard-to-trace shorts or random voltage drops. - Extra water weight: The extra weight all of that water filling up the PVC jacket could be significant. I intended to use this cable for outdoor permanent installations of LED light strings, hung or mounted in various ways on my house and in landscaping. I live in a wet climate, and after a few months of rainy fall/winter/spring weather I estimate that the added weight of all that water filling up the empty space within the cable jacket would more than double the total weight of the cable runs. With a couple hundred feet of cable, that weight will add up pretty quickly. - Water damage: Depending on how/where your cabling is routed, you could essentially be installing a de-facto water pipe that will shunt rain and/or irrigation water through the excess space within the outer jacket and into areas of your walls/house that would otherwise have remained perfectly dry. A potential recipe for serious hidden water damage. I ended up returning this and buying a different product elsewhere.",

The casing is nice and thick and would be great for connecting to a landscape light low voltage transformer. I don’t think it would work very well with typical adding/splicing of the lights since the lines are not separated, but if you need a solid run to feed lights further from the source or in a different area this wire would be great.",

The jacket is especially flexible and is supposed to be rated for outdoor use. The wire itself is tinned copper so it's pretty decent quality. There's truly a lot of applications for this kind of wire, but I'm going to use it to wire LED lights onto my truck. Overall, I think it's a good quality and good value for the money.",
      "PVC jacket|||B09V56LTY5 ★★★★★ [2022-06-27] <b>Good coil of wire</b> Just be aware that this is PVC, not silicone. It is more like traditional stranded lamp wire than the newer style super flexible silicone with a million strands in each conductor. If you bend a strand off to the side, it will hold that shape, like, say normal picture wire. This is not a criticism, just saying this is more of a traditional hook up wire, which is just right if that is what you are looking for. Good jacket, stripped easily without breaking any strands, priced competitively. Recommended.",
      "Thick PVC jacket|||B0CN9FNFZC ★★★★★ [2024-01-17] <b>Excellent cable, a bit overkill for thermostat</b> This is a very good cable, perhaps overkill for thermostat wire. It has 8 conductors and a very thick PVC jacket. The strands are of tinned copper (See image where I scratched off the tin coat). Colors on the strands: White, Black, Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Yellow, Brown. There is plenty of chalk when removing the outer sleeve. Chalk is used to keep moisture out, which makes it less combustible. It's not riser rated though. Marking on the cable: ESHENG PAI STYLE2497435P 2464 18AWG 80ºC 300V VW-I 1 A 18AWG 80ºC 300V PTI TRIUMPHCABLE So, a legit, good quality Triumph Wire (China) cable sold under a seemingly random name. It's exactly as described on the listing. Keep in mind that this is stranded wire and the jacket is a bit thick. It's very flexible, so it does work as a thermostat wire although overkill. Because it's stranded, it's not as quick working on it as a solid wire. So not ideal as a thermostat cable, but a quality cable regardless.",

      "Thick plastic jacket/insulation|||B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ [2023-12-29] <b>Everything it should be - easy to handle</b> There is not a lot to say here, other than the advertisement for this cable matches what was received (that's a good thing....doesn't always happen these days!). The insulation, around both cables, is very thick should handle most extreme situations. The wires are actually stranded copper wire and not a \"copper clad\" imitation. The size is 16AWG and was tested with a caliper and a wire-cutter. The length was slightly over 32.8FT. Honestly, nothing negative about this listing and would recommend it if the price/size/options meet you needs. Everything came out as expected and would get it again if needed.",
      "Black PVC jacket with glossy finish|||B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ [2023-10-02] <b>Great Value For 4-Conductor 18AWG Wire</b> What’s not to like about this wire? The flame retardant and IP68 ratings make it ideal for automotive use and the 18AWG copper conductors are suitable for many related applications. The black PVC jacket has a glossy finish, so be aware if you have aesthetic considerations. Each of the four wires have nicely tinned copper conductors and the red/black/yellow/blue colors are common to many circuits. You can easily strip the external black PVC and use the individual wires as needed. This is a solid deal for a combined 200’ of 18AWG wire for less than $40. The included zip ties and heat shrink were a nice bonus.",
      "Silicone covering|||B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ [2024-02-28] <b>Assortment of colors makes it easy to keep circuits identifiable</b> This is a set of 6 different colors of tinned copper wire that came on individual spools. This is a great set to have on hand for use with projects that I will need to wire in the future. The colors of the silicone covering is easily visible and identify. I'm have not used wire with thus type of shielding before so I was skeptical. I opened one spool and put it to the test. I knew that tinned wire was easier to solder and offered less resistance and works great for wiring projects. What I didn't know was the silicone covering. After opening the spool I found the covering to be very flexible. It was more maneuverable the other wire I had worked with. It kind of felt like plastic and rubber blended together. It claimed it would withstand high heat and extreme cold. I used my lighter and it took a long time to melt the silicone. I then put the wire in the freezer and after freezing it was still very pliable. This set also came with different colored zip ties so if you need to keep different wires together in a group going to one place these come in handy. This is a great set to keep on hand and I'm sure you will be happy with every project you use them on. They offer so much more then other wire's I've used in the past",
      "Thick plastic jacket/insulation|||B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ [2024-01-21] <b>Great fur underground wiring</b> I used this stuff for a short run of lighting and power, and it works well.

If you are doing a job that has taxing environmental issues such as underground runs or in an automobile, this would be perfect! For me though, having to manually trim the skin back was a pain. Still, it is as-advertised, so I can't take off of the rating for that. Well-made, good quality product.",

The jacketing is flexible yet really durable. Took a couple passes with the wire strippers to get it through the outer jacketing. The inner wires jacketing was also thick. You can easily see that this wire can handle being buried if needed. The 18 gauge can also handle quite a bit of current if running lighting (or even speakers). Little on the expensive side...but keep in mind that this cable is made for outdoors and/or direct burial and that is definitely what you are getting for you money. If you need to run a cable outdoors, do yourself a favor and get the right wire to do the job. Nothing worse than trying to save money only to have something short (or catch fire) on something cheaper. This is worth the price for what it does...",

      "Protective PVC sheath|||B0CQP4KJM4 ★★★★★ [2024-03-26] <b>Nice 4-condcutor wire!</b> I love this kind of wire! It's four wires, essentially, with a protective PVC sheathe. I love this stuff because it removes the need for corrugated PVC split-loom. The sheathe acts to protect the wires against abrasion, and if you're running wire in vehicles, with all of their tight turns and sharp edges, you need abrasion protection. I got this to run accessories in my Jeep, including light pods, a light bar, speakers, and various gadgets I have running through my cab. I like this stuff because all of the wires stay contained, which reduces a lot of the mess when running wire. If you're making an amp board for your vehicle, for instance, having fewer wires running around gives you a much cleaner install. Wire like this is good for this. The individual wires are 16 gauge, which should be plenty to handle the power draw of LED lighting. Overall, this is good wire. For the price you get a decent length, and if it behaves like others of its kind, should last a long, long time.",

It's nicely tinned real copper wire with excellent insulation on the individual wires. The 4 individual wires are wrapped / jacketed in a PVC sleeve. It's a sleeve - the wires are free floating within - which was great for my application. I was able to make a quick slit with utility blade grab the wires and tear down the sleeve to the spot I wanted the sleeve removed. I used this to wire up new DC dimmable led lamps in my warehouse. The four wires allowed me to use two wires for DC dimmers and two wires for AC circuit. I found the nearest ground and ran a ground to that. Good wire - Good Price 5 Stars",

The conductor insulation is sufficiently thick to provide decent protection, without being difficult to bend. The PVC jacket containing the bundle is also decently thick, while being nice and flexible. It has a glossy finish which looks nice, but does attract dirt/contaminates. All this combined makes this six-core bundle rather easy to run for the overall size.

The PVC sheathing on this wire is smooth and I was able to easily pull it through a conduit to replace an old wire with just some electrical tape joining the ends. Tested with a light drawing 2 amps, and only detected a .3V voltage drop across the entire 50 foot coil. Sold as 12V low voltage wire, but rated for 300V. I like that this wire is rated for direct burial and waterproof, so long as it remains undamaged. It's easy enough to slide this through some conduit or at least sections of old garden hose or something to make it more durable and resist chafing. The PVC sleeve is somewhat loose and the individual wires can be removed from short sections fairly easily. Not very flexible, but easy enough to bend. The price point is typical for similar products, but I see a 20% discount is currently offered, making it a good bargain for a good product.",

Each wire comes on it's own individual plastic reel, but they are not labeled. The actual wire sheathing IS labeled with the wires size and capacity. Speaking of the wire sheathing, it is very SOFT, leading to a wire that's very flexible but at the cost of abrasion resistance. You can easily strip the sheathing from the wire with your finger nails.

      "Heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket|||B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ [2024-02-14] <b>Quality wire in a durable jacket</b> I acquired this cable to wire some repair some existing lights and add supplemental warning lights on my tractor. Wire for rear tractor lighting needs to be run along the underside where brush, sticks, briars claw away at it constantly. More than once, I have had wiring damaged or destroyed. I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications. I really like this wire, and I look forward to using it to upgrade my tractor warning lights in preparation for spring. It would be equally suitable for use on a mowers or trailers as well. I think this product will provide adequate protection for wiring in a tough environment for a long time. In fact, with good end connections, I am hopeful that it will last as long as the equipment.",

I liked the idea of being able to spool off needed wire quickly. What arrived was a flat box with the wire spools just laying flat. Didn't affect the quality of the wire and I'm quite pleased with the silicone sleeve and solid wire core. Using on some electronic projects and the wire is a VERY good value. In shopping around this proved to be the best price around. Having it deliver in a short time was a bonus. The silicone sleeve strips easily which is important to me. The wire is sturdy, and I've not had any breakage while reasonably bending several times to fit tight spots. The very end of each spool is tinned, but not the full spool. This is to be expected and does not impact the usage in any way. I've used this on several small projects and am very happy. The silicone sleeve does not easily melt which has been an issue with other rubber and plastic-coated wires I've tried. I've used solder of course but also heat-shrink tubing where I used an open flame torch to shrink the tubing around the wire. I've not noticed any damage to the wire as I cautiously applied the direct-flame heat. (Heat gun is much better to use in this application, I just did not have mine available!) I'm pleased with the purchase.",

Today I made connections using this wire by soldering as well as crimping connectors. I was super pleased with how it performed. Thanks for reading my review!

      "round shape|||B0BRN8DWTL ★★★★★ [2023-03-06] <b>Looks great, provides old fashion appearance, with safe modern materials</b> I have tried the brass colored version of this and have to say that the pictures in the product listing are a very accurate representation. The cord looks as good in person as the photos show. It is a reasonable facsimile for either replacing antiquated electrical wiring in old lamps and such, or adding a little extra visual flair to current devices. Of course, when replacing old wiring, you are also gaining the safety of a cord that is using modern insulating materials, which is much safer at this point, than older wiring which may have very dry and brittle insulation layers between the strands of wire. The only comment I can make about it that may be a negative factor for some is that the cord is round, rather than most lamp cord that tends to be a bit flattened. This may also have something to do with this cord being a little stiffer than the typical lamp cord you may be most familiar with."

      "Wide and flat shape|||B079NXCN6B ★☆☆☆☆ [2020-04-17] <b>Started peeling off in less than a day</b> It doesn't stay stuck to my wall. I followed the instructions and watched the video beforehand. I wiped the wall with a damp microfiber to remove any dust and let it dry. I then applied the Ghost Wire starting at one end, peeling about a foot of the backing off at a time, smoothing it and rubbing it to the wall. Working the wrinkles out as I went along. Within one day, both ends of the run had about 6 inches peeling off the wall. Three days later, and both ends are now peeled off about 2 feet. Every morning I've tried to rub it back to the wall. My walls do have a very slight orange peel texture. Perhaps on a smooth finish the Ghost Wire would adhere better. I have not attempted to paint over it yet (and likely won't since it doesn't stay on). The total length of my application was 11.5 feet. Beyond the issue of it not remaining adhered, there were a couple other issues as well. First, there's about 1/8 of clear adhesive which is not covered by the white surface material running down the entire length of the roll. This is very visible (and sticky feeling). I was hoping that I could spray some wall texture over it since paint will likely not cover it correctly. I also snapped off my exposed ends when attaching the end connectors. Since the copper is very thin, any etching done with a razor blade to cleanly expose the copper strips weakens it to the point that any flex will shear it off. I had to peel back and use scissors, leaving a small flap rather than a nice clean transition. My Ghost Wire also was quite wrinkled from being rolled up. The manufacturer states that it's a known issue and recommends a heatgun/hairdryer to remedy so I expected that going in I liked the idea of this product. If it would have stayed on the wall, it would have been great. Even with the problems I had, I could see this working well if run under a carpet. I'm contemplating using a router to notch a shallow channel in the drywall and then just mud over the inserted wire. [update] A week later, and it's completely peeled off. Not an inch is left stuck to the wall. It's just hanging between the two connector blocks that are screwed in."

The sheathing is a bit of a mixed bag for me. It's fairly thick and tough which is good, but the thickness does make it a bit less flexible than other wire of it's type I've used. It's also more rectangular than round so the flexibility suffers somewhat when trying to route it in tight spaces and makes it more difficult to use with a standard sheath cutter for round cable. The wire itself is good, the coating should help keep it from degrading over time. I would also prefer it came on a reel instead of wrapped and held with Velcro straps, but it's not a big deal. I have a bunch of reels from 3D printing filament and wound it up on one and it worked out well. So overall it's a good product for the dough."

      "Flared outwards|||B07111R7N8 ★★★★★ [2022-03-05] <b>FOR CAR AUDIO PEOPLE…</b> I was looking for copper tinned lugs for my car audio build. I usually buy my lugs directly from sky high car audio, but I was in a bit of a money pinch so $10 for a pack of 10 didn’t seem that worth it at the time. I ended up coming across these bad boys, which happened to be the best deal around. 50 lugs for less than $40. Honestly I was pretty hyped. I ended up remember that car audio 1/0 is not standard 1/0 welding wire. It’s actually oversized 1/0…so right in between 1/0-2/0. I decided to go for the 2/0 lugs and purchased 50 of them. I tested it out on 1/0 sky high wire and it fit like a GLOVE. The 2/0 lug itself is smaller than sky high 1/0 lug, which was kinda nice because I am working on tight space. I did try the 2/0 lug on some sky high 2/0 and there’s no chance it would go in. Maybe if you force a ton, but even then it won’t work. I couldn’t even get the head of the wire in and these lugs are flared outwards too. I haven’t crimped them yet but I will soon, I’ll update the review when I get to crimping stage. But as of now, they get a 5/5 for fitting oversized 1/0 car audio wire. Update 3/6/22: crimping is absolutely awesome. I have two types of crimpers, hydraulics and handheld $30 crimpers from amazon. I decided to use the handheld crimper, even though it doesn't go up to 2/0 size. Stuck it on the 1/0 setting and did 2 crimps at the bottom and top of the lug. Had my dad pull one end of the wire while I held the lug end of the wire. We both pulled as hard as we could and it didn't even move. I'd say they work as intended."

      "O-ring on each side|||B0CJ3Y1BNQ ★★★★★ [2024-01-10] <b>Easy to use, waterproof 4 wire connector</b> This review is for 4 Pin IP68 Outdoor Waterproof Electrical Wire Connector for 5-12mm Wire Diameter, (Max 24A 450V) This connector separates into five pieces for installation of the wires to be spliced/connected. There are two mid pieces that contain a rubber sleeve. Two size sleeves are provided: 5mm and 12mm. They are squeezed by tightening the end caps to form a watertight seal on the exterior wire jacket. Note that the description of 5-12mm wire size refers to this outer cable jacket. The mid pieces screw together over the center section which contains the wire splicing block. It appears that up to 16 gauge wire could be used. Each wire is placed in a ferrule and is captured by a screw that is tightened such that the wire is pushed into the ferrule body, which contains a similar screw arrangement on the other side allowing two wires to be spliced/connected. The mid pieces screw over the center section and the joint is made waterproof by an o-ring on each side. They claim IP68, which means that the connection should not be continuously kept underwater. I tested the connector under a running faucet for 5 minutes and no water got inside. It should be fine in any rainstorm. I would not place it where it could be exposed to strong streams of water, such as in a pressure washer. The rating of 24A means no more than 6A per contact. If you use this for more than 50V, I would make sure that all strands on the wire are inside the ferrule and that the wire insulation goes right up to the ferrule to minimize creapage paths for high voltage. Overall, this is a very effective and compact way of splicing wires that will be exposed to weather. These were installed on the control cables of an amateur radio antenna system. I like their design and will buy more when the need arises."

      "Plastic seals|||B0CJ3Y1BNQ ★★★★★ [2024-01-22] <b>Decent waterproof coupler/connector</b> The description calls this a “connector”. The distinction is subtle but this is technically a coupler: it couples two cables. But it is also a connector because it connects the electrical conductors inside the cable. In any case, the connector should be considered a permanent connector, as much as anything is truly permanent. Because the various components are all screwed together, these connection and coupling processes can both be reversed, I can decouple the cable and disconnect the wires. This connector is, however, NOT a not quick disconnect device. It is not intended for frequent decoupling or even multiple disconnects and re-connects. The plastic seals will most likely lose their ability to seal properly, but it should support an occasional disconnect. My Intended Use: I plan to use these connectors on my fishing light cable to extend the depth from 15 ft to about 40 feet. I fish for kokanee in winter under the ice. They can be found anywhere from 10 ft deep to about 40 ft. My fishing light only comes with a 15 ft cable. So, it needs an extension. The connector to do this will need to be waterproof to about 30 ft (approx. 9 m) for a handful of hours at a time. In this use, I may need to occasionally reconnect things as fine tune it. For best security, I should probably use a new connector each time... I won’t be able to actually use this extended light until we have safe ice conditions. I will report back on my experience as soon as possible. IP68 Rating and Maximum Depth: What is the actual depth rating – and duration – for this connector? The IP68 rating only means that the device will remain waterproof essentially indefinitely, down to the depth specified by the manufacturer. [OK, here comes the really nerdy part of this reviewer...] One: According to the Product Description page, this connector has an IP68 rating down to a depth of 3 meters with an unstated but implied indefinite duration, technically not deep enough for my use. However, the PDF documents in the Product guides and documents section, give different specifications. Two: The “Technical Report” (see “Certificate of Analysis” link) states that the test specification for the IEC60528 standard for IPX8 lists the Test conditions for the IPX8 rating as 2 meters for 120 hrs. The test to verify this was performed at 2 meters, and passed. Three: In the “Attestation of Conformity” document attached to the “Safety Information” link, it says that the rated conditions were specified by the client as120 hours down to 4 meters. The test for this specification was performed at 4 meters, and also passed. Since one of these tests was performed at 4 meters, we can assume it is waterproof for up to 120 hours down to 4 meters. This is still less than my desired depth of 9 meters but since I will be using this connector for only a couple hours at a time, I think it will be OK. I will report back after I verify this on the ice. After connecting (and coupling) the fish light cable and my extension cable, I can say that the connection feels secure and looks to be waterproof. One should probably use appropriate ferrules on the ends of the wires to be screwed into the connector, but I tinned mine with solder. This means that I had to re-tighten the screws a couple of times before considering the connection permanent and closing it up. I like these connectors. They look secure and should be waterproof enough for my needs. My only complaint for them is the lack of information on assembly. Specifically, I would like to know how TIGHTLY to twist the parts together. They need to be tight enough so the seals become and remain waterproof, yet not so tight that the plastic parts split open in the long term. Despite that I still give thee connectors a 5 star rating. (At least, down to 30 feet... :)"

Connecting the through wires on the top of the “tee” was fairly easy to do, but it required the assistance of pliers to ease the top down to pierce the insulation. Connecting the wires on the bottom of the “tee” wasn’t as easy. It took a couple of attempts to align the wires and hopefully get both to connect. The use of pliers was also required. Prying the top open required lifting 2 small tabs that can be a bit challenging to get them both to release at the same time. It can take a bit of patience, but eventually all connections were successful."

This is just what I needed to get electricity to my wyze cams on the corners of my house. A couple of tips... 1) One reviewer mentioned red/black inner insulation, but mine did not have that. Instead, I used the white lettering on one of the two wires to connote the hot wire. The wire I received has white lettering on just one of the two conductors. I called that the \"hot\" wire and I made sure the piercing prongs on both ends mapped the white lettering to the \"hot prong\". The neutral prong is the wider of the two prongs on the plugs, so the hot is the narrow prong. 2) I found that the plugs each (male and female) have a couple of slots on the \"closed\" end (the open end is where the wire comes out of the fully assembled plug). I figured I would split about 3/8 of the insulation to have two separated ends and jam them into those slots. This way its impossible for the conductors to touch each other. Then lay the dual wire over the metal piercers and slide the back over the wire. However, before I slid the back cover on, I did tap the dual wire down carefully to ensure that the wires are thoroughly pierced. This allows the back to slide on easier.

      "Large size cap end with metal pin|||B07Q5JXYCP ★★★★☆ [2022-01-13] <b>Wire is 5 stars, connectors get 3 stars.</b> There's not much to say about the wire other than it is your typical low voltage, outdoor rated, direct bury 14 gauge stranded copper wire. It is solid copper, and not plated like you'll get with lower priced wire. The price is at least 25% less than what you'll pay in a big box store. The connectors don't come with instructions although they are somewhat intuitive to install. Installation goes much easier if you attach the connector to the 14 gauge wire first by separating about 3\" of the two 14 gauge vconductors. Then unscrewing the larger size cap end of the connector. Underneath the cap you'll see a long metal pin. The pin will pierce the insulation of the wire when you screw the cap back on the connector. Once you have it attached to the 14 gauge wire unscrew the cap on the other end of the connector. This cap will have a small hole in which you insert the stripped end of whatever wire is coming from the light fixture you're trying to attach. Make sure you strip about a half an inch of insulation off that wire. I inserted this wire through the hole of the cap and then into the open end of the connector. They'll be a small metal rod sticking up and you want to press the wire in as far as it'll go and then screw the cap back on. If all went well the pressure of the cap will hold the wire inside the connector. I'm not sure about the weather resistance of the metal used inside this connector so I used some electrical corrosion prevention paste, which is a dark gray silicon based gel that is sold to help weatherproof outdoor electrical connections or when you're dealing with aluminum wiring. Hopefully the paste will make the connection more weather resistant. So far they've been out in the yard for a few months and I haven't had any issues.",

I’m using them with the Voltme 30W GaN III charger bloc, and I’ve tried them directly to my LG G7 phone as well as with an Eazpower wireless charger – these combinations charge my phone more than twice as fast as my original LG charger and cable. I also use them with the Voltme charger for miscellaneous small electronic devices, with no problems. A nice extra – each cable comes with a velcro tie attached, which is always appreciated, especially with a 6-foot cable.

Now the cords do work for charging, and data, just not for fast charging. Also, once you plus the devices in, the cords don't seem to want to click in all the way. Now as far as the quality goes, they seem to be well made and constructed. So, I took a star off for not being able to fast charge with them."

      "Ends pre-stripped|||B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★☆ [2023-11-17] <b>Nice looking cable</b> Right out of the box/bag I was impressed with this wire. They certainly paid attention to the presentation. It has a shiny outer jacket, it comes with two velcro straps to keep it neatly coiled, it also has a baggie full of heat-shrink tubing and tie wraps. They even took the time to strip off about 2 inches of the outer jacket on either end of the cable and then stripped the ends of each individual wire. So good job to them for recognizing that presentation matters. The outer jacket is just a sleeve, it's not bonded to the wire like many others. I doubt that this is burial grade and the listing doesn't say that it is. The listing shows 12 volts, but if you strip back enough of the outer jacket, you can see that the wire itself has 600V and 105 degrees Celsius printed on it. For me, this wire is going to work great and I'm happy with it.",

The spool of 16 Gauge wire arrived with both ends exposed as pictured. I soldered connectors on one of the ends for my project. The wire and both shields are made out of time proven materials not the unrated flimsy silicone coverings that have entered the market of late. Tinned AWG Wire is widely used to install Automotive and Marine accessories. This item, 16 Gauge AWG Copper Wire is available in many different gauges making it an ideal choice for LED lighting, Electric Awnings, Back Up camera, and Stereo installations. The AWG tinned Copper wire holds solder very well allowing for direct solder connections, thereby eliminating many issues that arise when crimping or connecting wires. I am using Wire Nuts, IP68 Compression connectors, and Direct Solder Terminals for my application, I am very happy with the high quality and performance of this UL Listed AWG wire."

      "End caps on wire ends|||B0CGQ29J9Q ★★★★★ [2023-03-11] <b>Perfect for outdoor speaker wire.</b> I like listening to music when I’m outside working in the yard. I move a column speaker outside and connect it to a small PA amp. The flexible KWANGIL 16 AWG wire makes this process much easier than the stiffer 18 AWG speaker wire that I had previously been using. As an added bonus, this wire is UV stable and also tinned to protect it from corrosion. And the tinned wire is super easy to solder. KWANGIL even supplies the coil with an end cap on each wire end to keep the wire in perfect condition until it’s ready to be used. The 20 feet of wire is supplied wound in a ~7 ½ inch coil and packaged in a sealed plastic bag. Thanks to the large size of the coil, when the wire is unwrapped it lays fairly flat unlike wire that has been tightly coiled. Stripping the outer jacket was just as easy as the listing said it would be. I stripped 4 inches from one end with no problem. Stripping the individual wires on the other hand isn’t as easy. The insulation on each wire is tight but that also keeps moisture away. Stripping ½ inch took a bit of work, stripping 1 inch I found easiest to do in two ½ inch pieces. The wire works great with the speaker and is easy to coil when I’m ready to put the speaker away.",

I love the thinness of the overall cable, while I still trust the outer jacket to hold up well. The specs are clearly labelled on the outer jacket in gray, which makes them useful if you’re looking for the specs. The text blends in otherwise, just like on other cables. Inside the cable, the wires are clearly color-coded for easy identification. This cable ships in a nice coil with Velcro holding it together. It also came with little rubber endcaps, which just shows me that this manufacturer really cares! I highly recommend this cable for your projects."

The end cap openings are not secured and pull loose very easily when trying to insert the wiring. The problem appears to be that the insertion opening is too rigid and tends to bend the wire before it is completely inside the wire nut. There IS sufficient silicone for waterproofing however, installing the wiring into the wire nut is a real chore. I have used much better waterproof wire nuts from other vendors and am disappointed in this product. Thankfully, I'm only doing routine maintenance/repair at this time on a previously installed landscape lighting system.

      "Screwed together components|||B0CJ3Y1BNQ ★★★★★ [2024-01-22] <b>Decent waterproof coupler/connector</b> The description calls this a “connector”. The distinction is subtle but this is technically a coupler: it couples two cables. But it is also a connector because it connects the electrical conductors inside the cable. In any case, the connector should be considered a permanent connector, as much as anything is truly permanent. Because the various components are all screwed together, these connection and coupling processes can both be reversed, I can decouple the cable and disconnect the wires. This connector is, however, NOT a not quick disconnect device. It is not intended for frequent decoupling or even multiple disconnects and re-connects. The plastic seals will most likely lose their ability to seal properly, but it should support an occasional disconnect. My Intended Use: I plan to use these connectors on my fishing light cable to extend the depth from 15 ft to about 40 feet. I fish for kokanee in winter under the ice. They can be found anywhere from 10 ft deep to about 40 ft. My fishing light only comes with a 15 ft cable. So, it needs an extension. The connector to do this will need to be waterproof to about 30 ft (approx. 9 m) for a handful of hours at a time. In this use, I may need to occasionally reconnect things as fine tune it. For best security, I should probably use a new connector each time... I won’t be able to actually use this extended light until we have safe ice conditions. I will report back on my experience as soon as possible. IP68 Rating and Maximum Depth: What is the actual depth rating – and duration – for this connector? The IP68 rating only means that the device will remain waterproof essentially indefinitely, down to the depth specified by the manufacturer. [OK, here comes the really nerdy part of this reviewer...] One: According to the Product Description page, this connector has an IP68 rating down to a depth of 3 meters with an unstated but implied indefinite duration, technically not deep enough for my use. However, the PDF documents in the Product guides and documents section, give different specifications. Two: The “Technical Report” (see “Certificate of Analysis” link) states that the test specification for the IEC60528 standard for IPX8 lists the Test conditions for the IPX8 rating as 2 meters for 120 hrs. The test to verify this was performed at 2 meters, and passed. Three: In the “Attestation of Conformity” document attached to the “Safety Information” link, it says that the rated conditions were specified by the client as120 hours down to 4 meters. The test for this specification was performed at 4 meters, and also passed. Since one of these tests was performed at 4 meters, we can assume it is waterproof for up to 120 hours down to 4 meters. This is still less than my desired depth of 9 meters but since I will be using this connector for only a couple hours at a time, I think it will be OK. I will report back after I verify this on the ice. After connecting (and coupling) the fish light cable and my extension cable, I can say that the connection feels secure and looks to be waterproof. One should probably use appropriate ferrules on the ends of the wires to be screwed into the connector, but I tinned mine with solder. This means that I had to re-tighten the screws a couple of times before considering the connection permanent and closing it up. I like these connectors. They look secure and should be waterproof enough for my needs. My only complaint for them is the lack of information on assembly. Specifically, I would like to know how TIGHTLY to twist the parts together. They need to be tight enough so the seals become and remain waterproof, yet not so tight that the plastic parts split open in the long term. Despite that I still give thee connectors a 5 star rating. (At least, down to 30 feet... :)"

The two layers of insulation strip cleanly and easily, making connections to the galvanized steel inner conductor simple. With this larger roll (100m/328 feet) I can extend the garden fence to include some nearby fruit trees as well. I also plan to use it to add to the grounding system for better shock effectiveness. One thing that should be noted is that the listing describes this product as: “16 Gauge Class 3 Galvanized Steel wire, Insulation Rated Up to15,000 Volts. Resistance 56 ohms/mile”. This 16-gauge product is actually 161 Ohms/mile; it is the larger 12-1/2-gauge conductor that is only 56 Ohms/mile. Other than that, this seems like a good product and a good value for the money.",

      "Hard plastic spool|||B0C65LQYPP ★★★★★ [2023-10-19] <b>easy to use</b> This high-quality wire is made of 14 AWG copper-clad aluminum and comes in a 100-foot length with red and black conductors, enclosed in a high-quality PVC jacket. It's rated CL2 for in-wall use and complies with fire safety regulations for safe installation within walls. The wire exhibits excellent conductivity, high mechanical strength, and various beneficial features, including flame retardance, resistance to aging, acid and alkali resistance, and damp-proof properties. It's easy to strip and cut to any length needed, making it versatile for different applications. The wire is conveniently wrapped around a hard plastic spool for easy dispensing. It features two jacket colors, red and black, to quickly and easily distinguish polarity, and numbered markings for accuracy. The flexible jacket material allows for easy twisting and extending as needed. Each conductor is color-coded and enclosed within the white CL2 outer jacket, ensuring safety for use within residential class building walls. I've personally used this wire to replace my car's speaker wiring, and I'm pleased with its performance. The copper-clad aluminum core maintains good audio quality, making it an excellent choice for speaker wiring. It's relatively soft and easy to work with, and the durable outer jacket ensures long-lasting use.",
      "Comes on a plastic spool|||B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ [2024-01-25] <b>Insulation is robust and strong, conductor is galvanized steel.</b> This is some tough wire. The outer diameter is just over 1/4\" - (0.275\"), the conductor is 0.098\". The transparent inner insulator was not measured as it is well bonded to the outer black insulation. The transparent layer is much thinner than is shown in the listing pictures. Still, this is about the most robust direct burial high voltage fencing wire I've used. I'd have no concern burying this in rocky soil. The reel comes with clear plastic wrap to hold the wire snug. However, they didn't use enough of it so the outer two layers of wire unwound like a clock spring. Recommendation overall - excellent deal!"

The wires can be pulled apart very easily, without any fear of exposing copper, for applications where you don’t need three or where the wires terminate in different places. My only caution is to double check the gauge requirement for your application. These are very thin wires. They’re supposed to be that thin, but if you’re not well acquainted with electrical hardware, you might accidentally order these for the wrong application. Know up front how much current you’ll be running (and how far) so that you don’t burn something down. In my application, I was mostly wiring LEDs, which draw a tiny current.",

Comes in 10 colors each on a seperate reel. Once you remove the shrinkwrap, the wire does tend to want to unwind off the spool, but such is the nature of this wire.

It means you can run a short length of about 18 without a messy tangle of wire, separate the ends where they solder to the tabs. The wires are pre-tinned, so once you remove ¼ inch of the sleeve, you can solder directly without taking more time fiddling and tinning yourself.

I move a column speaker outside and connect it to a small PA amp. The flexible KWANGIL 16 AWG wire makes this process much easier than the stiffer 18 AWG speaker wire that I had previously been using. As an added bonus, this wire is UV stable and also tinned to protect it from corrosion. And the tinned wire is super easy to solder. KWANGIL even supplies the coil with an end cap on each wire end to keep the wire in perfect condition until it’s ready to be used. The 20 feet of wire is supplied wound in a ~7 ½ inch coil and packaged in a sealed plastic bag. Thanks to the large size of the coil, when the wire is unwrapped it lays fairly flat unlike wire that has been tightly coiled. Stripping the outer jacket was just as easy as the listing said it would be. I stripped 4 inches from one end with no problem. Stripping the individual wires on the other hand isn’t as easy. The insulation on each wire is tight but that also keeps moisture away. Stripping ½ inch took a bit of work, stripping 1 inch I found easiest to do in two ½ inch pieces.

So, I hopped on Amazon to find a good replacement/upgrade. I was originally looking at 5-wire cables (after all, that's all I really needed), but then I saw this 18-gauge, 8-wire cable for just a few dollars more and decided to go with it instead. This would provide a degree of future-proofing (such as adding a whole-house humidifier, extra sensors, or the like in the future). This 18-gauge, 8-wire cable was thicker and stiffer than my old 20-gauge (?), 4-wire cable, and thus a bit trickier to pull through the wall from the thermostat to the furnace (be sure to check your cable path first to ensure it will fit (width of thru-holes, radius of bends, etc.). But, I just taped one end of the new cable to the old cable, crossed my fingers, and started a pullin'. Thankfully, with a bit of elbow grease, it worked! It looks and feels high quality and came in ample length for my needs (and then some).

      "500 feet of wire|||B0C9H1G52F ★★★★★ [2023-10-10] <b>Works well - Good value</b> All copper products have gotten to noise-bleed pricing of late. Even running low voltage wire is just ridiculously expensive especially if you run to one of the home stores. Ad frankly , if you're ordering wire without knowing what it is or seeing/feeling it, it can be a little scary as the quality varies so much. This wire arrives on a wooden core. Okay - that makes 500ft of heavy a little heavier, but you know they care about their product. It's also probably the only way to ship it so it doesn't end up as a bundle of knotted wire when it arrives in your standard Amazon box which in my case was shipped through UPS and clearly had a tough ride. But 500 feet of wire is pretty heavy at about 22 lbs on a 10x10-ish core. And the wire made it fine with a nice sheet of cardboard wrapped around the wire in between the core ends. The box clearly won over whichever UPS employee was fighting with it. The wire just feels like quality. It''s a firm, yet flexible outer sheath holding the two separate strands of 16 gauge wire. The sheath is UV resistant and rated for direct burial. It's UL listed and RoHS rated. It seems like a quality product and for purposes it's great. My use case is extending an existing low voltage run along the side of the property of the house to the back and introducing low voltage lights to the back yard. In southern Florida, the groundwater is high, the weather humid, and the sun hot. What better test ground for this? Anyhow it's ultimately gonna be buried under landscape rocks yet above landscape fabric in most places. Others will be direct burial In certain spots known for puddling. I expect no issues given the quality of this wire. And at 16Awg I expect it to be able to carry the 12 volts I need without concern. Highly recommend.",

This isn't too bad for 20ft, but I expect to get every inch I paid for. Now maybe some of the other rolls were longer, but I didn't verify. If that is the case then they need to be more consistant. The second issue involves using the box as a \"dispenser\". THere are holes in the back of the box to feed the wire. The problem is if you put all 6 spools in side by side, then there isn't enough room to close the lid or for the spools to spin. They came packed with the spools in a 2x3 configuration instead of the 1x6 configuration you would use for dispensing. This is because they don't fit otherwise. Looks like good wire.

I use 14/2 cable in my landscape lighting for the final connections to groups of LED fixtures. I use 12/2 for distribution over long distances to get to the clusters of fixtures. 14/2 works great in that application and helps to save a little money compared to running 12/2 everywhere. If your cable runs are all short and you have a modest number of LED fixtures then 14/2 may be good enough for the entire system. Note that 14/2 cable has a lower current rating than 12/2 cable, which is counterintuitive given the numbers are getting smaller as ampacity increases.

It's really quite simple - this wire is every bit as good as any of the other 12/2 wire I have on my system, and that is a good thing, because all of the wire I have used is a good quality, and this is wire is no exception. Since this wire is essentially the same as all the others I have used, what it really comes down to is value for the money.

      "PVC jacketed two conductor cord|||B0BRN8DWTL ★★★★★ [2023-03-09] <b>Heavy duty and UL rated.</b> This is safety-approved UL, SVT, 300V, VW-1, 105C, 18 gauge, PVC jacketed two conductor cord wrapped in a braided jacket to give it an antique appearance. I'm not sure the Amazon listing made it clear that this is UL approved, but it is. I measured the outside diameter at .225\", and peeling back the Rayon cover reveals a round white PVC jacket that is .210\" diameter. The PVC makes this cord rugged but also quite stiff compared to true antique (and less safe) cloth-covered cord that was usually just one or two cloth layers wound directly over the two individually-insulated conductors, but without the extra molded PVC jacket. Vintage cord used on lamps, radios, and other electrical devices usually was a little less bulky, more flexible and sometimes had an oval cross-section rather than round. This cord is well-suited for modern retro lighting and restoration applications where extreme flexibility and the ability to hang naturally under its own weight over short lengths is not a requirement. For greater flexibility, twisted cloth-covered cord is available from other sources. This has each PVC coated conductor individually wrapped in cloth and the pair of wires twisted together, yielding greater flexibility. Several years ago I had to buy cord like this for an antique replica that I built, and I paid a lot more buying it from an antique radio part supplier. This is a high quality product with safety approvals at a very good price. Highly recommended.",

      "Two conductors joined by thin rubber section|||B0CSD3GJ53 ★★★★☆ [2024-03-08] <b>ETL listed, just like regular zip wire but 12 gauge</b> With spring headed our way, we're beginning to plan for some landscaping improvements in our yard, and low-voltage lighting is one of the things I'd like to add, so I picked up this wire. This wire looks like your typical lamp cord/zip wire, but at 12 gauge, this is pretty stout wire. Like zip wire, the two conductors are insulated in black flexible rubber insulation and joined by a thin section of rubber in the middle, so you can easily split the two conductors apart for making any necessary connections. And like typical zip wire, one of the conductors is identified by ribbing on the exterior of the insulation; this conductor is used, by convention, as the neutral wire. I've learned the hard way that before you put any wire into service, check it for breaks. Both conductors in this 100 foot spool passed the continuity test. What else is there to like? They include a chart (see photo) that shows the maximum wattage for any given length and gauge of wire, so it's nice to have that as a handy reference. It's also ETL listed (sort of like UL listed). For low voltage applications like landscape lighting, you could argue that being ETL listed is overkill, but it's a nice thing to have regardless since it is rated for up to 300 volts. One minor nit--I wish that they had length markings on the wire like some wires do--once you start using this, it's nice to be able to know how much length is remaining without having to unspool it and find it's not enough. Again, maybe overkill for a 100' spool but that would have been a really nice touch.",

The 18/2 wire configuration, with two conductors, is suitable for a wide range of electrical projects. It allows for easy connection of various components, such as LED strips, lamps, switches, and more. The wire is color-coded, with one conductor in red and the other in black, making it simple to identify and connect the positive and negative terminals correctly. The length of the wire, 100ft (30.48m), provides ample supply for most projects, allowing for flexibility in routing and installation. The wire is neatly packaged and easy to handle, without any tangles or kinks. I have used this wire extensively in my automotive projects, and it has performed flawlessly. The low voltage rating of 12V ensures safe and reliable operation without any risk of electrical hazards. The wire's insulation is of high quality and provides excellent protection against short circuits and electrical interference. Overall, the 18 Gauge Wire 2 Conductor Electrical Wire is a reliable and versatile option for various electrical applications. Its flexibility, tinned copper conductors, and durable construction make it ideal for automotive, lighting, marine, and other low voltage projects.

Looking out at the green and the shade that those trees provide is a great feeling. But why enjoy them only during the day.

Unfortunately, those can get expensive and the batteries in them are usually still NiCad, which will lose their charge after just a few months. Wiring your own lights isn't difficult. This Elite 16/2 Landscape Lighting Wire provides low voltage copper wires in an outdoor-rated, weather resistant coating that can be buried without additional conduits. The pricing for this product is reasonable there really isn't much to complain about. The wire itself is somewhat stiff but it really is like working with the drip irrigation pipes.

I got out some Southwire Romex and compared the two. This Arizona branded wire was nearly identical. The outer jacket was cut and pulled back and the wire stripped just as easily as the Romex. The only difference I really noticed was the outer jacket of the Romex felt more slick or slippery to the Arizona wire. It might matter a little bit if you are trying to pull it through 10 studs at once or so, but I don't think it would be a big difference. Overall, this wire seems to be right in line with the Romex. At the moment, this 100 ft roll is cheaper by about $20 than the 100 ft of Romex. I will say if you can bump up to the 250 ft roll, that is usually the best deal, but sometimes that is just overkill for your project and a smaller roll works out better.

And in our recent endeavor, the direct burial landscape light wire we procured became a star player. Boasting robust construction, it met our criteria both in terms of price and performance. The industrial-grade PVC insulation is a testament to its durability, ensuring longevity even in demanding outdoor conditions. As a 2-wire product, it further simplifies installations. A thoughtful touch is the distinctive design of each wire: one side is smoothly finished, while the other bears grooves, making identification a breeze during setup. However, there's one aspect where the product could be enhanced — its packaging. The wire is sheathed entirely in plastic, and accessing it requires completely removing this protective cover. This might sound like a minor quibble, but when you're deep into the intricacies of landscaping, unwrapping the wire can become a tangled chore, leading to unintended project delays. In conclusion, the landscape light wire has much going for it, and I'd consider repurchasing it for future projects.

It looks like it will be extremely durable. It does make the wire bigger overall, though, if that matters for the particular use case. For me it doesn't, so I'm happy with it. I must admit I had quite a lot of trouble stripping this wire at first. Traditional strippers that have a sharpened hole certainly wouldn't work due to the two conductors inside occupying more space in one direction than another. I tried cutting them carefully with a sharp knife and ended up cutting into the inner conductors despite my care. I think the trick is to either have some nice wire strippers that have the two heads that pull apart, which mostly work, or using a sharp knife in concert with bending the wire away from the cut so it pulls itself apart when split. A dismantling tool also works fairly well, though is harder to keep as pretty. The self-adjusting stripper is the easiest way and makes a decently clean separation, but is a bit fickle at the size and stretchiness of the outer layer. I was slightly confused that the wire fit inside an 18awg ferrule, thinking they may have undersized the wire, but I tried another 16 gauge wire I had in hand and it did too. So no worries, I think.

I did watch the stripping video in this listing, which makes it look easy. It is also different wire. That was three conductor, this is two I was impressed to see all of the manufacturer and importer information on the box. Regardless, I found the cable to be stiff. It is as if it is already vintage and hardening up. So between the lack of ease of use and the stiffness: 2 stars",

I didn't want to go the PVC route and wanted something that didn't take up much room when I store it and this fits the bill. I just tied the bunch together and hang it on the fence when not in use. I but two rolls of it and that was good because you use it up fast because it's thick. I think I got maybe a dozen hoops 3 ft high out of a roll, maybe a little more. That corresponds to probably each piece 8 or so feet long when you count the foot they're in the ground on each side. It's strong enough that I can stick it straight in the ground a foot and it will maintain its shape. A lighter gauge I'd probably have to put a metal or PVC tube of some kind in the ground and put the wire inside the tube. One caveat: given the thickness of this gauge I had to buy a special cutter for it. This cutter just barely does the job but for the amount I need to use it I wasn't going to pay more than $10 - $12 for a$30 cutter that would go through it like butter. Don't think you're going to cut this with tin snips or dikes because you aren't. I might have gone one gauge lighter and it would have been easier to cut but I'm not sure it would hold up the row cover as well as it does. I'm using a hoop about every 2 1/2 to 3 ft.

      "18-gauge thickness|||B0C7T9YK2N ★★★☆☆ [2023-10-14] <b>Fine wire, but a little skimpy on the amount, with poorly thought out dispenser</b> First; just as an admission, I usually work on low-power circuits and use much thinner wire (22 gauge or above). However, it's good to have some thicker wire around for those times you have to move a lot of current, so I ordered the 18-gauge silicone wire. As for the wire itself, it seems high quality, with decent insulation. It's pre-tinned, which supposedly makes it easier to solder, though I didn't notice a huge difference (see video). It's nice that it comes with some heat-shrink in the same colors, for those times when you can't hide your wires from view. It even comes with colored zip ties, though I see less of a use for these. On the downside, the spools aren't that full; it's only 10 ft of wire, which frankly isn't that much. It'd be much more useful if they filled the spools. Like other wire assortments, the box this comes in doubles as a dispenser. However, it's kind of a disaster. Instead of aligning the spools vertically side by side, they lay the spools flat, with the wires coming out both sides. It's a little hard to explain the geometry of it all, but the spools get jumbled up much more easily, the box doesn't stay closed as firmly, and it's a pain to respool the wire if you've accidentally pulled out too much. There's a reason practically every wire assortment puts the spools side-by-side; it just plain works better. So while this is fine wire, i'd really recommend looking for a kit with a decent dispenser and more than 10ft per spool.",

Other than that the cord works fine. I don't downgrade any stars, because they clearly state that the cord is SPT-2. I don't plan to use this outdoors, but the quality seems sufficient for the price. You should also consider that the insulation is (again clearly stated) PVC, so no-one is trying to trick you here. This is just decent cheap cord to get the job done.

Mostly the thing I like the most is how flexible the wire is. Describing how flexible I would have to say it’s as flexible as a cooked spaghetti noodle. The extreme flexibility takes all the stress off of my 12v switches. All of the other wires were so stiff they pulled on the switches due to how the wires hung or which way the wire was going. This caused the switches to sometimes not stay in place on the panel or the wires could work themselves loose or could pull off at times. I typically am using 12 and 14 gauge wires due to the high watts of many of the led lights I use and even the 12 gauge silicone wires are as flexible as a cooked spaghetti noodle.

      "12-½ gauge|||B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ [2024-01-31] <b>Works great for farm use</b> The RiteFENCE Electric Fence Double Insulated Underground Hard Cable is working perfectly for use 'underneath' my 12' and 16' foot double gates that lead to my pasture. For years I have used a system where I disconnect my electric fence by hand to open my gates without getting shocked. I dug a small trench about 6\" deep under a couple of my gates and buried the RiteFENCE, and left each end protrude out of the ground about two feet to connect to one of the lower existing fence wires so as not to disconnect the continuous circuit at any time when opening gates now. I chose the 6\" depth to bury the heavily insulated RiteFENCE since in addition to moving livestock through the gates, I also drive vehicles and farm implements through the gates as well. The RiteFENCE is very sturdy and rigid, and the 12-½ gauge took some time to straighten out to fit flat and neatly into the trenches I dug and placed the wire into, but this is a definite plus for electric fence wire to be used on a farm or ranch. The RiteFENCE doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and has a thick outer coating with the inner wire apparently coated as well for the 'double insulation' aspect. When installing, I also cut back a couple of inches of the RiteFENCE on each end and used a heavy duty crimp connection to the barb wire fencing I use. Once crimped, I neatly wrapped the connections with quality electrical tape to seal from the elements. The RiteFENCE is going to be ideal for many other underground connection needs I have around the farm. I would highly recommend any farmers and ranchers who run electric fence to give the RiteFENCE a try if you want to eliminate the risk of a nasty shock, especially with the higher powered fence chargers. The price point seems very fair and in fact is actually a little cheaper than what I saw at my local farm supply store. Highly recommend!",

It is easy to strip, readily accepts solder, crimp, compression, or butt connectors so you can make reliable connections and splices. The manufacturer also includes some heat-shrink tubing with this product but its small diameter (only a little larger than each insulated conductor itself) didn’t make it particularly useful.

However it is advertised as 10 gauge (they are very adamant that this wire does not conform to AWG spec and will not advertise it as AWG), but it fits perfectly into a 12ga/AWG ferrule. I looked around reviews both for this one and the 12gauge variant and all around I saw that the 12ga wire that they sell is actually more like 14ga/AWG size and the 10ga size is more like 12ga/AWG size. The outer diameter is probably 10ga but the inner is for sure very close to 12AWG. Pure copper for the same length would be like 2-4x the price, but a safe assumption would be that CCA holds 80% of pure copper amperage (since aluminum has 70% of the conductance of copper, but I add in roughly 10% cause there is a copper layer on top). Say if 10AWG pure copper holds 30 amps between 12-80V DC, then CCA wire of the same cross directional size would probably safely hold ~24 amps or less (<21 amps) if you hold CCA wire as the same conductance as pure aluminum and believe the copper layer is just for show. Just know what you're buying and your tolerances. Overall, very good for your low budget, low amperage needs.",

      "Conductors below 24 AWG|||B07GH7JHG9 ★☆☆☆☆ [2023-02-09] <b>This cable is comprised of copper clad aluminum wire</b> First the pros: The cable comes in a nice box and the cable feeds out of this box without tangles. The outer black sheath is smooth and feeds well through conduit without lubrication. The product is priced very well if you think you are buying top quality copper conductor cable. The cons: This is really lousy cable. The conductors are supposed to be 23 AWG but the box I received measured below 24 AWG. The individual wires are brittle and break easily. So easily in fact that it was almost impossible to terminate in an RJ-45 plug. After spending hours placing this cable through walls and attic space, testing revealed there was a break somewhere along the cable. Makes perfect sense. Just manipulating the twisted pair to straighten for termination would cause at least one of the eight conductors to snap off. I have terminated lots of twisted pair cable and this was by far the most difficult to work with. Also, the product title does not indicate this is copper coated aluminum (CCA) cable wire.",
      "Wire thickness|||B08JPLRXRK ★☆☆☆☆ [2023-02-14] <b>Fragile for 2.54mm connectors.</b> Very fragile for crimping 2.54mm connectors. They just tear apart easily. The 4 included (small) heat shrink bits are nothing less but a joke. I would be surprised if the gage rating was really respected because the (weak) insulation is very thick as opposed to the actual wire that is very flimsy. I would not recommend. It rendered useless for me and I wouldn't risk to set my house on fire to save a few bucks."

      "12 to 4 gauge wires|||B0BY25MWGN ★★★★★ [2022-09-15] <b>Rewired my Shipping Container</b> I recently converted my shipping container to solar and with it came heat. My container had been built to be powered and since I wanted to be off the grid solar is my option. I have a windmill that I will be adding later but for now solar it is. Solar power is hot. Connecting wires to a battery and inverter get hot. Regular wires will not work in this setup and I need thicker wires. I have found that 12 to 4 gauge wires work best for me. Thicker wires connecting the big things and 12 gauge leading to my appliances. This wire is easy to use and is extremely flexible. It is easy to connect and cut. The plastic can take high temps as well as the wire. This wire will help save fuses as other wires I used caused my fuses to pop way to often. The containers are in the high desert so the interior gets hot as it is so good wires are even more important. These are solid wires. If you are looking for a way to convert your cheaper wires into something better check these wires out. They are solid, they can take high heat and they work well.",

The insulation is easy to strip. The insulation does shrink back a little when you're tinning the wire and soldering connections, but I didn't have any problems with it. The wire tins well using regular non-leaded rosin-cored solder. The dispenser box is handy, and I especially like that I was able to purchase different sizes - I bought 24, 22, and 20 gauge - to suit my various needs."

This resists corrosion and will carry electricity very well. - Packaging was very good and there are 3 twist ties around the roll of wire, holding it together and keeping it neat. Twist ties are very good because they are much easier to deal with than zip ties and they are reusable. Cons: - Outer insulation is PVC, which will likely become much stiffer in cold weather, but it appears to be good quality PVC, so maybe it won't be too bad.

La lunghezza generosa di 30 metri (100 piedi) è stata esattamente ciò di cui avevo bisogno per i miei progetti di cablaggio. Il cavo è realizzato con rame stagnato di alta qualità, che garantisce una trasmissione affidabile del segnale e una maggiore resistenza alla corrosione nel tempo. La flessibilità del cavo è ottima, il che rende facile maneggiarlo e installarlo anche in spazi ristretti o complessi. Inoltre, la sezione trasversale di 0.3mm² è adatta per una varietà di applicazioni, dalla cablatura di dispositivi elettronici al collegamento di sensori e attuatori. Ho trovato che la saldatura su questo cavo sia stata estremamente semplice e pulita, grazie alla superficie stagnata che favorisce un'ottima adesione del saldatore. In conclusione, consiglio vivamente il cavo di prolunga Carlits 22AWG a chiunque abbia bisogno di un cavo di alta qualità per i propri progetti elettronici. La sua affidabilità, flessibilità e facilità di saldatura lo rendono una scelta eccellente per hobbisti e professionisti alike.",

NOTE: I did not purchase myself but a company I hired to fix my irrigation used it and WOW, it works! For my situation we needed to a) add 2 new zones to my system while also b) fixing a zone that had a damaged wire somewhere, most likely under some concrete. The irrigation company used these little gadgets to prevent having to dig all the way back to the pump/controller in the garage. I bet this saved them HOURS of digging and rewiring.

I assume all this makes it easier to work with for pros, but for a layman you have to be cautious not to rip through to the conductors.

This so-called 18 AWG wire is much thinner than any other 18 gauge wire I have ever worked with. This is tinned copper wire, where a tiny coating of tin is applied to the copper wire to keep it from corroding.

Where it is true that the smaller, finer stranded wire is more flexible and can withstand vibrational and motion flexing better than course stranded wire, fine stranded wire cannot carry any more current than the course stranded wire, or solid wire of the same diameter. So, this product has false information printed on its outer insulation. When measuring the cross-sectional area of the wire, it is much closer to the industry standard for 12 gauge, 105 strand wire. The industry standard for 10 gauge wire with 105 strands is 0.116\", and what I received is 0.102\", which is the industry standard for 12 gauge wire! So, one dare not try to use this 12 gauge wire for 25 to 30 amp applications suited for TRUE 10 gauge wire without running the risk of violating the physics of what I received.

This kit gave me most of what I needed. The conductor is nicely flexible and looks to be of good quality, a tin-coated, very fine braid.

      "Conductors smaller than claimed 18 gauge|||B0CN9FNFZC ★★★☆☆ [2024-01-19] <b>Handy multi-conductor cable; probably not quite 18ga?</b> As the title says, this multi-conductor cable will come in handy for a number of my DIY projects. Since some of those may involve something on my boat, having tinned conductors is a real plus -- it does help prevent corrosion of the copper, and you can see the tinned strands in one of my included photos. My one issue with this product is the claim that the conductors are 18 gauge. Granted, I don't plan to use this anywhere that I'll be pushing the limits of an 18ga wire, but I did want at least to test the claims. I don't have a great way of measuring the diameter of the wire, especially with twisted strands. This is technically what the wire gauge means. However, a wire's resistance is a function of its cross-sectional area, and there are numerous free online calculators to let you determine what the resistance of a certain gauge of wire should be for a given length of wire. Here's what you do: Search for wire resistance calculator Enter 18 gauge and 50 ft You get 0.319 ohms Measure the resistance of one conductor for the entire 50' spool Compare your resistance reading to what it should be As shown, I used the red conductor (they should all be the same) and I got between 0.38 and 0.40 ohms. Since the resistance is higher than it should be for 18 gauge, I can know with reasonable certainty that the wire is smaller than 18 gauge. In fact, a 19 gauge wire (uncommon in the US) should be right at 0.403 ohms for 50' of wire. This all may not sound like much, but the resistance is over 22% higher than it should be for 18ga, which means that you're getting 22% less copper than you're expecting. All that's to say that this product seems fine, and as long as you're not depending on the full conductivity of a true 18 gauge wire, you'll be good. However, I tend to score products pretty harshly when they make claims that they can't hold up to, and sadly that's the case with this cable. Buy it and use it, eyes wide open, or buy something else if you need a true 18 gauge wire.",

Pics show the black spool and the red, which was correctly labeled as 14 gauge. Other than that the wire is top notch. Strands are solid copper, high quality, and the jackets crimp really well. Aside from the hassle of returning the wrong gauge I have zero complaints. It's great to see high quality USA-made wire on Amazon.",

So far, this seems to be as good as anything I can source locally, and 10 cents a foot keeps the price competitive. I like the silicone jacket. It makes the wire very easy to work with. I was worried it wouldn’t hold up as well to the heat of soldering, but I was very careful and had no issues. It was too small to really use a crimp connector so I did mostly soldering and heat shrink. The tinned wire took solder well and I didn’t have any issues with connectivity or creating a solid connection. I didn’t have my calipers handy to check this versus other 20 AWG wire but it seemed comparable. Even so, sometime manufactures use more insulation and less metal to give it the impression that it is the same size. With wire I am unfamiliar with, I always size up against the standard AWG amp ratings just to be safe. It’s hard to say if the jacket will hold up to harsh conditions. For my purposes, it’s being used inside an enclosure and is well-protected. If you’re going to use this for automotive, marine or exterior projects, I’d leave a piece of wire outside for a while to test it before committing to a full project. Overall, a good value wire option if you don’t have a power hungry circuit where only the best will do.",

      "Very stiff due to the gauge|||B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ [2024-01-26] <b>Really works without reducing power!!!</b> You might not realize that you need this particular product, but with the voltage that you put though an electric fence, and sending to ground to boot, normal wires will leak a lot of your power if buried. I used this on my mains powered fence, which automatically adjusts output for load, once i put this into the ground, i turned it back on and it didn't increase the power output at all. With a normal 12 gage Romex that you would run for 120v house power it bleeds so much power that my power unit could barely keep up with the losses.

      "100ft (30.48m)|||B0BGS5GRSK ★★★★★ [2023-10-24] <b>Reliable and Versatile</b> I recently purchased the 18 Gauge Wire 2 Conductor Electrical Wire for my automotive and lighting projects, and I am extremely satisfied with its performance. This wire is perfect for low voltage applications, such as automotive wiring, LED strips, lamp lighting, and marine projects. Therefore, I am giving it a five-star rating. The wire is made of high-quality 18 AWG stranded PVC cord, which provides excellent flexibility and durability. I have found that this flexibility makes it easy to route the wire in tight spaces and around corners without any issues. Additionally, the stranded construction ensures that the wire is resistant to breakage and can withstand the rigors of demanding applications. The tinned copper conductors are another great feature of this wire. The tinning process adds a layer of protection to the copper, making it more resistant to corrosion and extending the lifespan of the wire. This is particularly important for marine applications, where exposure to moisture and saltwater can be a concern. The 18/2 wire configuration, with two conductors, is suitable for a wide range of electrical projects. It allows for easy connection of various components, such as LED strips, lamps, switches, and more. The wire is color-coded, with one conductor in red and the other in black, making it simple to identify and connect the positive and negative terminals correctly. The length of the wire, 100ft (30.48m), provides ample supply for most projects, allowing for flexibility in routing and installation. The wire is neatly packaged and easy to handle, without any tangles or kinks. I have used this wire extensively in my automotive projects, and it has performed flawlessly. The low voltage rating of 12V ensures safe and reliable operation without any risk of electrical hazards. The wire's insulation is of high quality and provides excellent protection against short circuits and electrical interference. Overall, the 18 Gauge Wire 2 Conductor Electrical Wire is a reliable and versatile option for various electrical applications. Its flexibility, tinned copper conductors, and durable construction make it ideal for automotive, lighting, marine, and other low voltage projects. I would rate this wire five out of five stars for its quality, performance, and versatility.

Definitely better than what was offered at my local hardware store. Got the 50 ft even tho I only needed 25 (just in case). Good move on my part as there was an unseen obstacle in the wall and I had to go around, which burned up an additional 15 of wire. Now the Nest Learning V3 has it's own C wire and there is plenty of wire options left over for what ever we decide to add to the furnace in the future (which is why I decided to go with the 18/8 instead of the 18/5.

      "30ft roll|||B0BYNNJS8B ★★★★★ [2023-11-04] <b>Good Quality, High Temp Wire</b> I work on a lot of electronics requiring 12-gauge wire and recently procured this wire for a couple of my projects. I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful.",

Observations: Previously Vine reviewed the 10ft 12AWG cable by iGreely, and the jacket was not UV resistant as stated; after 3-months in the sun daily, the jacket faded from red to nearly white, therefore, the UV resistance claim is suspect. You can see pictures of the faded cable in my review listed below. Recommendation: Along with the largest wire, you should also go with the shortest for your applications. iGreely offers 1.0, 1.8 and 3.0 meters, so order the one that meets your need.

I ordered the 12 awg with 10 feet of each red and black. I was just trying to round out my stock a bit as I already had some 10, 14 and 16 awg silicone wire around. I tend to order BNTechGo as I tried them once and was plenty happy with it. This stuff seems just as good as far as I can tell. My main concern was if it was real tinned copper or not so I stripped a section and scraped it with a sharp knife until I could clearly see the copper start showing through the tin. So yes, this is definitely real copper. The strands are extremely fine, which is great for flexibility but can make it tough to strip without cutting some. But that's the case with all flexible silicone wire, so no real issue there compared to other brands.

It might matter a little bit if you are trying to pull it through 10 studs at once or so, but I don't think it would be a big difference. Overall, this wire seems to be right in line with the Romex. At the moment, this 100 ft roll is cheaper by about $20 than the 100 ft of Romex. I will say if you can bump up to the 250 ft roll, that is usually the best deal, but sometimes that is just overkill for your project and a smaller roll works out better. I would certainly have no issues using this wire for adding some lights or outlets and might use it to wire up my shed soon.",

Specifically, this is a 50 foot roll of Type NM-B , 10/3 copper conductor with ground (red/black/white and uninsulated ground). Further labeling indicates: Made in USA, SIM Technology, and a \"Real Romex\" label. Rated 600 volts with non-metallic sheath. Manufactured by Southwire. The orange-colored outer sheath strips nicely (as does the inner conductor insulation) and pulls nicely (could be my imagination but it seems a bit denser and \"slicker\" than the traditional beige Romex). Anyway . . . good install experience and I wouldn't hesitate to save a few bucks and use this brand again.",

The wire is of good quality and it has met my expectations. One of the main reasons I purchased this wire was for its length. The 40FT wire is long enough to cover the entire length of my LED strip lighting project and it provides enough slack to make the installation process much easier. The 2pin 2 color red black cable also makes it easy to identify the positive and negative wires, which is very helpful during the installation process. The red and black color coding also helps me to keep track of the connections and ensure that everything is connected properly. The 18-gauge wire is also thick enough to handle the current of my LED strip lights, which I found to be a big plus. It ensures that the wire can handle the power and prevents any potential overheating or damage to the wire. The only downside to this product is that the wire is a bit stiff, it's not very flexible which can make it a bit difficult to bend and shape to the desired position. But it's a small price to pay for the quality and durability of the wire. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the TYUMEN 40FT 18 Gauge 2pin 2 Color Red Black Cable Hookup Electrical Wire for LED Strips. It's a great investment for anyone who wants a high-quality and durable wire for their LED strip lighting projects.

      "10 foot length|||B01B6R0OKQ ★★★★★ [2023-07-06] <b>Works well, looks nice</b> I installed some wireless, solar-powered security cameras on my house and was concerned about the longevity of the USB cable used to connect the solar panels to the cameras. The cords are permanently attached to the panels and cannot be replaced, so I didn't want them exposed constantly to sunlight and weather. So I ordered a 10' roll of the 3/8th\" tubing. I measure out how much cable length I'd need plus a little slack, then I wrapped the excess around one or both of the panel/camera mounts (depending on how much unused cable length there'd be) and wrapped self-bonding silicone tape around the cable to secure/waterproof/protect it. Then I cut an appropriate length of the split tubing and slipped it over the exposed cable between the two, then for some cameras where necessary I cut a smaller piece or two and added them to the small amount of slack I left after the wrapping. Where appropriate I wrapped a small amount of the silicone tape on the ends to keep it in place/further waterproof it. This gives a clean, finished, and professional look. I was impressed with the results so much I've ordered more additional cameras, as well as to help reorganize some computer cable routing.

      "100 feet long|||B0CSD35PQT ★★★★☆ [2024-03-05] <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone.",

      "25 foot roll|||B0C5BLQ327 ★★★★★ [2023-06-07] <b>Nice length for small project.</b> 25ft is not much, so if you are doing a small job it is great. 12guage is perfect as well for 20 amp breakers, and more than needed for 15 amps. This is a standard Romex style wire with vinyl outer sleeve and insulated individual wires, (white, black, and uninsulated ground.) I do wonder why we do not insulate our ground wires, but that is the standard here and I haven't seen any issues to date with that. Honestly, ground and neutral seem to be ok on the same ground blocks unless you feed into a sub panel where neutral and ground have to be on separate bus bars. Moving on from the lesson, I can say this is a good 12/2 romex that I can recommend that is also decently priced. Locally 15ft of 12/2 romex costs 28 dollars and 40 dollars for 25ft just to give some context on how good this is as a deal.",

      "Heavy for its size|||B0CSD35PQT ★★★★☆ [2024-03-05] <b>This wire is great for underground applications as well as for ordinary use.</b> When you get this wire package, you know there's some copper in it! It's heavy for its size. It's a hundred feet of 14 gauge, finely stranded wire, rated for use with voltages up to 300V. This means you can use it for landscape lighting as it is marketed towards, or for other wiring in you house or garage, since in America, house hold wiring never exceeds 220V. Usually underground-rated cabling is stiff and pretty ornery to strip, but this wire is entirely flexible and easily stripped for connection to your various fixtures. Besides the insulation, the type of wire inside generally determines how stiff the wire is. In this case, the wire gauge (14 ga) is smaller in diameter than the usual 12 ga, and this is helps in the flexibility department. The other flexibility factor is the \"stranding\" of the wire. Ordinary 12 and 14 ga wires have fewer small strands that make up the current capacity of the wire. The Sunvie wire that we're looking at has finer strands, but more of them to make up it's 14 ga rating. This really, really helps make the cable more flexible. But there is a price to pay for lots of finer strands, and that is they are a little harder to properly get wrapped around the screw terminal in your fixture - they tend to squeeze out from under the screw more easily than the stiffer wire. Be that as it may, this wire is, overall, pleasant to work with. Easily routed because of its flexible nature, can be directly buried - although you might want to avoid running it through a rock pile, and it is said it resists sunlight. And it is easy to cut, prep and connect. A note about it's electrical capacity, a chart provided with the wire package rates it for up to 110 watt loads for any distance 40' or less. So a standard incandescent 100 watt light bulb is just about at the limit for short cable runs. Any load higher than that will result in a voltage drop (at the light bulb) with the cable warming - or actually heating - up, the amount determined by the overload. I found this wire of good quality, and the ratings for it were clearly - if technically - explained. Were I to make a suggestion it would be to tone down the technical explanations - for instance, you might have a problem understanding the \"Low Voltage Wire Gauge Chart\" if you aren't of a slightly technical nature. I would also be a little more forceful on the packaging language. Saying it's \"Low Voltage Landscape Wire\" probably doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. They see the word \"wire\" and that they understand, and for that reason, might try to put this wire into an unsafe installation. For these reasons, and that reasons only, I give it 4 stars, rather than the 5 it deserves for product quality alone.",

The use as a wire spool is solid but not without flaw, the issue I have encountered is that the rubber feet need to have a larger surface area to prevent slippage on concrete, any minor amount of dust (frequently found on construction sites) tends to stick to the rubber eliminating the stiction required to prevent the unit from sliding across the floor when wire is being pulled. I was able to partially remedy this issue by placing a rubber wrench liner mat underneath the unit but without this modification when using lighter rolls of wire the unit is not stable. The other configuration options are numerous but most seem like advertised additions and will most likely be of little use, at least to me. Overall, the product can function as intended but the aforementioned stability issue requires modification if you intend to use the product on concrete.",

I noticed a difference when handling the wire, noticeably heavier. Looks like what you would expect. Worth the extra money in my opinion.

      "Heavy (about 22 lbs)|||B0C9H1G52F ★★★★★ [2023-10-10] <b>Works well - Good value</b> All copper products have gotten to noise-bleed pricing of late. Even running low voltage wire is just ridiculously expensive especially if you run to one of the home stores. Ad frankly , if you're ordering wire without knowing what it is or seeing/feeling it, it can be a little scary as the quality varies so much. This wire arrives on a wooden core. Okay - that makes 500ft of heavy a little heavier, but you know they care about their product. It's also probably the only way to ship it so it doesn't end up as a bundle of knotted wire when it arrives in your standard Amazon box which in my case was shipped through UPS and clearly had a tough ride. But 500 feet of wire is pretty heavy at about 22 lbs on a 10x10-ish core. And the wire made it fine with a nice sheet of cardboard wrapped around the wire in between the core ends. The box clearly won over whichever UPS employee was fighting with it. The wire just feels like quality. It''s a firm, yet flexible outer sheath holding the two separate strands of 16 gauge wire. The sheath is UV resistant and rated for direct burial. It's UL listed and RoHS rated. It seems like a quality product and for purposes it's great. My use case is extending an existing low voltage run along the side of the property of the house to the back and introducing low voltage lights to the back yard. In southern Florida, the groundwater is high, the weather humid, and the sun hot. What better test ground for this? Anyhow it's ultimately gonna be buried under landscape rocks yet above landscape fabric in most places. Others will be direct burial In certain spots known for puddling. I expect no issues given the quality of this wire. And at 16Awg I expect it to be able to carry the 12 volts I need without concern. Highly recommend.",

It may be PCV, but it strips exactly like Tefzel does and as far as I can tell it would be entirely suitable for use wire-wrapping, especially if you solder your wraps like you really should if you're confident in your schematic. This wire is less likely to tarnish than standard silver-plated wire-wrap wire. It's just the right size for data-level or small-signal connections to transistors and ICs, which move very little current and cannot overheat #30 wire. Any smaller and it would be difficult to work with.

I inspected the wiring at both the sensors and on the control board at the head unit and looked good. Was thinking that maybe the control board was bad. then I came upon a thread where the homeowner said he had a similar problem and replaced the wiring and it worked. That didn't seem the likely issue to me but it was cheaper than buying a new control board. So I rewired with this wiring and lo and behold, it works as it should. I only gave it 4 stars because it could stand to be about 2' longer. There is not much margin for error when you run it from the head unit to each sensor. I found I had about 3-4\" to spare without everything being run pretty tight over the rail, along the garage door header beam and then down the side king studs. Good luck."

      "Has length markings every foot|||B0C65LQYPP ★★★☆☆ [2023-09-30] <b>Possibly decent wire, but unclear on ratings.</b> So IF the wire is as listed, this is a pretty nice value for what you get. Let me break it down with Good and Bad. Good: - Comes on a spool and is tidy for easy removal and use. - Has length markings every foot, counting down from 100' so you know how much you have left. Nice! - Sheath material easy to work with and strip, as are the wires themselves. Bad: - The listing shows \"CL2/CL3 rated\". Well which is it? Neither the spool or the wire say anything about the rating, except for the spool which mentions 12 and 24 volts DC. No amperage given, which is possibly to be expected for speaker wire. - Additionally the listing mentions Direct Bury, which again, is not listed on the wire or spool. It has no filling in the sheath, and looks like no direct bury wire I have ever used. I am skeptical. - Frankly the overall lack of assurance that the wire is rated as it says it is in the listing is a problem for me. NOW IF it is indeed as the listing claims, then this is pretty nice two conductor wire and a good deal. Know what you are getting, and if it matches your need. The wires ARE aluminum, but clad with copper. If you want straight copper, look elsewhere. I would be careful in recommending this to a friend.",

It is copper as opposed to copper clad aluminum. It has a nice easy to feel ridge marking on one conductor for polarity identification but be careful to be consistent about using that tactile key, because the other conductor has white printed data, and it would be easy to confuse the issue. 16 gauge might be a bit small for some uses with landscaping lights, especially if you have lots of halogens, or long runs.

I called that the \"hot\" wire and I made sure the piercing prongs on both ends mapped the white lettering to the \"hot prong\". The neutral prong is the wider of the two prongs on the plugs, so the hot is the narrow prong. 2) I found that the plugs each (male and female) have a couple of slots on the \"closed\" end (the open end is where the wire comes out of the fully assembled plug). I figured I would split about 3/8 of the insulation to have two separated ends and jam them into those slots. This way its impossible for the conductors to touch each other. Then lay the dual wire over the metal piercers and slide the back over the wire. However, before I slid the back cover on, I did tap the dual wire down carefully to ensure that the wires are thoroughly pierced. This allows the back to slide on easier. Nonetheless, I did find that I needed to tap the backs into place with a rubber mallet. If all the above sounds overly complicated, just know that its not difficult to put together the plugs, if just not brain-dead easy.",

Observations: Previously Vine reviewed the 10ft 12AWG cable by iGreely, and the jacket was not UV resistant as stated; after 3-months in the sun daily, the jacket faded from red to nearly white, therefore, the UV resistance claim is suspect. You can see pictures of the faded cable in my review listed below. Recommendation: Along with the largest wire, you should also go with the shortest for your applications. iGreely offers 1.0, 1.8 and 3.0 meters, so order the one that meets your need. Based on previous iGreely wire experience, I would not use this wire outdoors. Pros: Heavy duty, 1x6mm^2 (10AWG) marked. Cons: UV resistance not proven (based on similar iGreely experience).

      "Labeled with remaining length every two feet|||B01KWBPC7M ★★★★★ [2020-06-04] <b>Very decent wire. In depth review & Pics</b> Running some permanent LED strips in the living room vaulted ceiling. Needed wire to run through the attic from the LED strips to a controller about 22 feet away. Wanted something heavier than the 22 gauge wire you find everywhere, and I wanted 100 foot spool Those two combinations limited what was out there. Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white). Even with my current strips, would have been nice to be able to upgrade without having to re-run wire. Oh well, happy anyway!",

It looks like it will be extremely durable. It does make the wire bigger overall, though, if that matters for the particular use case. For me it doesn't, so I'm happy with it. I must admit I had quite a lot of trouble stripping this wire at first. Traditional strippers that have a sharpened hole certainly wouldn't work due to the two conductors inside occupying more space in one direction than another. I tried cutting them carefully with a sharp knife and ended up cutting into the inner conductors despite my care. I think the trick is to either have some nice wire strippers that have the two heads that pull apart, which mostly work, or using a sharp knife in concert with bending the wire away from the cut so it pulls itself apart when split. A dismantling tool also works fairly well, though is harder to keep as pretty. The self-adjusting stripper is the easiest way and makes a decently clean separation, but is a bit fickle at the size and stretchiness of the outer layer. I was slightly confused that the wire fit inside an 18awg ferrule, thinking they may have undersized the wire, but I tried another 16 gauge wire I had in hand and it did too. So no worries, I think.

The outer diameter is just over 1/4\" - (0.275\"), the conductor is 0.098\". The transparent inner insulator was not measured as it is well bonded to the outer black insulation. The transparent layer is much thinner than is shown in the listing pictures. Still, this is about the most robust direct burial high voltage fencing wire I've used. I'd have no concern burying this in rocky soil. The reel comes with clear plastic wrap to hold the wire snug. However, they didn't use enough of it so the outer two layers of wire unwound like a clock spring. Recommendation overall - excellent deal!",
      "3/8 inch diameter|||B01B6R0OKQ ★★★★★ [2023-07-06] <b>Works well, looks nice</b> I installed some wireless, solar-powered security cameras on my house and was concerned about the longevity of the USB cable used to connect the solar panels to the cameras. The cords are permanently attached to the panels and cannot be replaced, so I didn't want them exposed constantly to sunlight and weather. So I ordered a 10' roll of the 3/8th\" tubing. I measure out how much cable length I'd need plus a little slack, then I wrapped the excess around one or both of the panel/camera mounts (depending on how much unused cable length there'd be) and wrapped self-bonding silicone tape around the cable to secure/waterproof/protect it. Then I cut an appropriate length of the split tubing and slipped it over the exposed cable between the two, then for some cameras where necessary I cut a smaller piece or two and added them to the small amount of slack I left after the wrapping. Where appropriate I wrapped a small amount of the silicone tape on the ends to keep it in place/further waterproof it. This gives a clean, finished, and professional look. I was impressed with the results so much I've ordered more additional cameras, as well as to help reorganize some computer cable routing. I'm up to 5 rolls so far, I just wish the larger sizes were also available in 10' lengths for a similar price.",

I'm not sure the Amazon listing made it clear that this is UL approved, but it is. I measured the outside diameter at .225\", and peeling back the Rayon cover reveals a round white PVC jacket that is .210\" diameter. The PVC makes this cord rugged but also quite stiff compared to true antique (and less safe) cloth-covered cord that was usually just one or two cloth layers wound directly over the two individually-insulated conductors, but without the extra molded PVC jacket. Vintage cord used on lamps, radios, and other electrical devices usually was a little less bulky, more flexible and sometimes had an oval cross-section rather than round. This cord is well-suited for modern retro lighting and restoration applications where extreme flexibility and the ability to hang naturally under its own weight over short lengths is not a requirement. For greater flexibility, twisted cloth-covered cord is available from other sources. This has each PVC coated conductor individually wrapped in cloth and the pair of wires twisted together, yielding greater flexibility. Several years ago I had to buy cord like this for an antique replica that I built, and I paid a lot more buying it from an antique radio part supplier. This is a high quality product with safety approvals at a very good price. Highly recommended.",

      "Suitable for 5-12mm wire diameter|||B0CJ3Y1BNQ ★★★★★ [2024-01-10] <b>Easy to use, waterproof 4 wire connector</b> This review is for 4 Pin IP68 Outdoor Waterproof Electrical Wire Connector for 5-12mm Wire Diameter, (Max 24A 450V) This connector separates into five pieces for installation of the wires to be spliced/connected. There are two mid pieces that contain a rubber sleeve. Two size sleeves are provided: 5mm and 12mm. They are squeezed by tightening the end caps to form a watertight seal on the exterior wire jacket. Note that the description of 5-12mm wire size refers to this outer cable jacket. The mid pieces screw together over the center section which contains the wire splicing block. It appears that up to 16 gauge wire could be used. Each wire is placed in a ferrule and is captured by a screw that is tightened such that the wire is pushed into the ferrule body, which contains a similar screw arrangement on the other side allowing two wires to be spliced/connected. The mid pieces screw over the center section and the joint is made waterproof by an o-ring on each side. They claim IP68, which means that the connection should not be continuously kept underwater. I tested the connector under a running faucet for 5 minutes and no water got inside. It should be fine in any rainstorm. I would not place it where it could be exposed to strong streams of water, such as in a pressure washer. The rating of 24A means no more than 6A per contact. If you use this for more than 50V, I would make sure that all strands on the wire are inside the ferrule and that the wire insulation goes right up to the ferrule to minimize creapage paths for high voltage. Overall, this is a very effective and compact way of splicing wires that will be exposed to weather. These were installed on the control cables of an amateur radio antenna system. I like their design and will buy more when the need arises.",

If it's too big, your taps and plugs simply won't fit. SPT-1 cord is supposed to have a much thinner insulation that SPT-2. I specifically chose this cord because it is listed as being SPT-1. Well...I nearly broke my thumbs trying to jam this into the Gilbert plug I bought. And then the first add-a-tap female plug I tried to install snapped in half because of the inordinate amount of pressure I had to apply to get it to close.

Best use is for hanging fixtures as the wires are encased in a non stretching hard rubber sheathing that can be clamped at the top of the fixture to prevent the wires from pulling out at the top from the fixture's weight. This inner rubber sheathing is a non-kink material and with just the right amount of flexibility for a nice straight hanging appearance, and is also very strong. I would not suggest this for wiring of table lamps and such because it's too thick (about 5/16\") and inflexible for that purpose; proper rayon lamp cord would be better for that use. A piece of advice: put a small amount of crazy glue on the cloth covering where you plan to terminate it when cutting, stripping, etc. It tends to fray and ride up the rubber core when being handled and can't be pulled back down; the glue keeps it in place and prevents fraying. Overall has worked well for re-wiring of vintage ceiling fixtures. Has an authentic look and bears a fair amount of weight.",

You see, buried PVC conduit is pretty much guaranteed to fill with water at some point, and I have come back years later to a water-filled conduit with this pull line in it and was able to pull it through without issue. What I do, though, is when I find the conduit filled with water I will actually using the existing pull line to pull through this as new pull line and THEN use the new line to pull the actual conductors, as I'm just not going to risk a break from it soaking for years :) But when I pull out the old line, it certainly LOOKS perfectly fine, so their claim of mildew/rot proof seems to be correct from my experience with this line. Don't be alarmed if the line is black instead of the blue in the product photos... it's the right product. Not sure why the product photos show blue, as even in big box stores it's black not blue. I'll end this with a tip for those who may not know: take a common plastic shopping bag, tie the pull line to the shopping bag, stuff it in the conduit and use a shop vac on the other end to pull it though.

Barring rodent attacks, it should stand up well. It would also be fine for speaker wiring and, because It is actually rated for 300V, you can use as 110V lamp cord.

      "Designed like lamp zip cord but splits too easily|||B0CMTTT3PR ★★★☆☆ [2024-01-19] <b>There are no ratings, UL or otherwise, on this cable</b> Ok, so I guess it really depends on what you are doing as to how happy you are going to be with this cable. If you are doing nothing more than running speaker wire, then good for you. You should be happy with the cable. If you are running power wire for an appliance, a solar system, or for any standard project other than low voltage battery, you will have to pause and wonder. What is the voltage rating? What is the current rating? Is this really OFC or something else? You can think it is something, but you will NOT know for sure. If you have an inspector ask for the ratings, you are out of luck and will have to rewire your project. The company says that it is 10 GA Oxygen free copper and they say the rating on the insulation is 200V. So, the problems start when you look at Silicon insulation and find that the normal low voltage rating is 600V up to 35,000V. 200V does not appear in any standard. Most oxygen free tinned copper still looks like copper when you cut it. This cable does not do that, even with a magnifying glass. So, how do you know? Nothing on the cable indicates that it is OFC or anything other than 10GA. Ok, once you get that resolved in your mind, this cable is designed like lamp zip cord except it splits way too easily. Great concept, but you will need to secure the cable ends somehow if you do not want it pulling apart. You can use electrical tape, shrink tubing, or even a tie wrap not pulled too tight. The cable itself is very flexible, like you would expect from a silicon wire. For use in a solar system where there is NO ground and you are required to install a breaker on both the negative and the positive side of the supply, this type of cable works very well. In fact, it is the project I started using it on until the Building inspector asked to see the data sheet on the wire or at least the UL number. Since I could not produce it, I had to remove what I had done and switch to a UL rated cable. Does that make this a bad product? No, it only makes it a quesitonable product since you do not know exactly what you have. I have not been able to find a way to directly contact the company to ask for a spec sheet. I just hope they watch the reviews and can provide the requested item, then this would be a product I would recommend. Until then, I cannot recommend it.",

Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful.",

The wire is bright and shiny and I feel no pits when I pull it through my fingers. I stretched about 6 inches between the alligator clips of a lab power supply set at 12 volts. It pulled about 900ma which means for that length of wire (eye-balled not measured) resistance is about 13 ohms. It glowed bright red. Note that wire increases in resistance as it is heated so this measurement will be higher than with an ohmmeter. I wrapped it around a pair of needle-nose pliers and pulled until it gave way. It required a few pounds of tension. Easily strong enough to use to cut Styrofoam, my opinion. I don't think copper will like the heat of a direct connection. For cutting Styrofoam, I think I would wrap it around a small length of steel wire and then push it through a steel butt connector and clamp it tight. Then attach the copper wire to the steel wire.",

All I can figure is it may be used if concealed from the weather, such as under the sides of a boat or inside a houseboat. It wouldn't be acceptable for a boat trailer, however, as the wires are exposed to the elements there. We chose to use the wire for the new speaker system for our television.

Be sure you know what you're buying. This is ultra flexible, with many super-fine strands and silicone rubber insulation marked 200C (higher than PVC but lower than PTFE). The fine strands (150 of them, but I didn't count!) can be a bit of a challenge when crimping contacts... make sure no microscopic strands escape the crimp -- then it works great. The insulation is thick but soft: very easy to work with but also easily damaged if used in the wrong application. It's the right cable for routing in tight locations, since it's so willing to bend and lay flat... good for DIY drones (flexing arms or retracting legs) or making wiring harnesses that need to flex but are well protected from abrasion and pinching. For more rugged high-temp insulation, consider PTFE but it is much more difficult to work with and hard to find at a reasonable price. As noted by others, some colors are a bit off. Red is clearly orange, and blue is gray-purple. That's okay for my purposes, but maybe not if you are building to a print for assemblies that will be inspected.

      "Encore brand repackaged under Arizona Electrical name|||B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★☆ [2023-06-05] <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again).",

UL rating should be fine in Canada. 1st - this wire is a much lighter wire and insulation then what should be the equivalent 12/2 NMWU. 2nd - the ground wire is molded into the sheathing making it difficult to separate and strip your hot and neutral wires (black, white). 3rd - this wire feels more rigid then 12/2 NMWU, making me wonder about copper content. And finally, this wire is rated for 600 V where 12/2 NMWU is rated for 300 V (as is 14/2 NMD90) - this does NOT change the Amperage rating. - so not sure why.

They might have a single strand of copper in each wire, and the rest be aluminum, but they are certainly not predominantly copper. The wire strands look and feel nothing like solid copper. Enter Shonsin brand, who I only recently discovered. I ordered this 10AWG cable hoping that for once it might be what was actually advertised, and for once I was pleasantly surprised ! Real solid copper strands, great flexibility, wire gauge to specification, nice flexible silicone sheath that doesn't shrink back when soldering or using heatshrink with a heatgun. Exactly what it should be. The outer diameter of the 10AWG wire was a little larger than ideal for part of my project (my fault for not checking, since it's EXACTLY as they list in their description and sizing/gauge table), and since for that specific use I can get away with 12AWG electrically, I just placed an order for some of their 12AWG cable too. I'm still using the 10AWG cable where the size permits, and will just use the 12AWG for the wires that needs to pass through a small grommet. Hopefully the 12AWG wire is just as good as the 10AWG that I'm already using.

The stranding measures a little over 1mm diameter, so 16 gauge is also accurate. The wiring jacket says AWM on it, so this would be suitable for appliances needing a new plug (this is not SJOOW and shouldn't be used for extension cables). When I stripped the jacket back there was a weird white powder substance (I presume from manufacturing). I bought this to extend the cable length on a portable LED flood light and had no issues soldering this wire. I am unsure why the listing title says low voltage, given there is a ground wire, but I can only presume it's because it uses a red/black color for live and neutral opposed to the industry standard blue/white coloring.

When it comes to outdoor, 12v landscape lights, you need to properly size the cable for the circuit. To do that, you take the number of lights you want to have on one circuit, and multiply by the number of watts. Nowadays, a typical LED type, 12 v light is in the 3 to 5 watt range. This is solid copper (the good stuff) 16 gauge cable, so it can handle up to 13 amps (which is about 1,500 watts!) but voltage does drop over distance. So this could easily handle one of the outdoor lighting kits or if you just want to add some more lights. (Old style, incandescent lights are a different story) 100% pure copper, direct burial, can't get much better than that, especially at this price",

The roll didn't come with the inner end sticking out so I unrolled it all, drilled a larger hole so it would fit, then re-wrappped (poorly). The inner end could be connected to a power source to allow re-using the roll for temporary tasks needing power at a distance. I measured 3.4mm dia. insulation, 1.4mm dia. wire. Resistance over the whole roll (100 ft. x both directions) was 0.864 ohms, which works out to 4.32 ohms per 1000 ft (verified with LCR meter and running 2A current through it).

I was surprised to see it was supposed to be over 1000 strand count for this size wire and I did not count the strands but there are definitely more than any wire this size I have ever seen. It is very flexible which was great because I had to pull it under the floor and through obstacles including through 3 walls to install it. I had changed my RV refrigerator over to a 12 volt compressor and due to a 30 foot run the wire I had with so few strands and smaller gauge had too much voltage loss to run the fridge well. This wire made an immediate difference and does not lose the voltage and carry amps load far greater than what I will ever need but it is nice to have more than less capability.

A bit concerning is that it is hard to see the copper to assess it. It is hard to see from the cut end and when I do get a bit of copper color I am not sure if it is a reflection. I scraped the tinning off from the sides and got a little pale pinkish color.

It has a high strand count, making it highly flexible and a pleasure to work with. The strands are individually tinned for corrosion resistance and solderability. It is also easy to strip. The insulation is rated to 105C, so it is safe to use under the hood, and makes it less likely to melt when soldering or applying heat shrink tubing. The description might lead one to believe that the wires are molded together as a two-conductor cable, but that is not the case; they are two separate wires, which is what I expected.",

Each wire is only .003 in diameter. I did not know they could extrude wire that thin and solder plate it. This makes the high strand count, solder coated wires highly suitable for both solder and crimp connections and combined with the silicone insulation make it very easy to route in tight places.

The resulting cross-cut area is approximately 4.374 square millimeters. After adjusting for an equivalent solid cross-cut section by reducing spaces between strands (around 27.3%), it should be around 3.18 square millimeters.

You can literally tie it in to a knot without damage to the cable. Only con, and not really a con vs. an observation is they pack so many strands into the cable that once you strip back the silicone insulation and the copper unpacks slightly it's difficult to fit the bare copper into a 6AWG terminal end without being extremely careful and patient.

To put this in perspective, I go through probably 100 ft. of automotive primary wire in any given week. I do a LOT of small electrical jobs for friends and family, everything from fixing headlights and wiring harnesses, to adding completely new circuits like heated seats or sound systems. I have 0 sound degradation when I use them for speaker wire. If you use it for that, something I've learned by a lot of real world trial and error, that may help someone else out there, is to run the speaker wires down the opposite side of the car you run the power wires; I don't know why it helps, someone who's smarter than I could tell you..maybe it helps cut out interference or something, but tbh I have no idea at all and am not educated enough on that to tell you the why, I just know that it really works. It's almost like some kind of weird, ancient, wiring feng-shui that yields better performance based on geographical location. Supernatural, ancient, far-east, geo-kinestethic techniques and practices aside, it really just helps get the desired result of clear, non-fuzzy sound... ...Ok! anyways, the crazy flexibility and high-strand count of the conductor inside the insulation makes it stupid dumb easy to push em through tight fitting holes without the need to alter the existing structure of something. They're surprisingly elastic, as well, which helps not tear off end bits of wire if you're like me and use an automatic wire stripper... and insist on having the tension permanently set to \"kill\" 😃. The elasticity of the insulation, which is made of/made with with silicone, also means if it gets caught while you run it, you step on it or slam it in something while pulling the wire, that won't (in my experience) compromise the conductor inside. I know that I SHOULD just replace that section of wire, even if it doesn't appear to be damaged, which I do when time and materials allow... and I know I SHOULD stop eating so much red meat, I know I SHOULD stop smoking, I know I SHOULD finally fix that back door screen that bangs every time the wind blows any faster than is required to move a stupid American Beauty grocery bag... my point is that I SHOULD do a lot of things, but don't always get to. in the real world sometimes you just aren't able to do things by the book, for whatever reason, and this wire hasn't let me down when those situations arise. I'll leave you with my answer to the question \"is this **** good enough to be the only wire ill use for automotive and small electronic applications moving forward?\"... ...\"bet\".

Wire stripping is ok with a regular stripping tool, may require rotating the wire before final pull to cut the insulation jacket around. Did not notice any cut wires if done with care. Since the individual wires are so thin, it definitely requires ferrules if going into screw terminations. Or rings. Definitely not for terminating a bare wire.

Well, decades later I am experienced and educated about thermostat wire cable. Very, very, rarely is the problem caused by bad thermostat wire cable itself. The thermostat wire problem is always caused by a person doing something wrong: stapling through the thermostat cable, shorting the conductors across a power transformer, crushing the thermostat wire cable between boards or vents, cutting the thermostat wire cable with a weed wacker, and etc.. Of course, I use a special staple gun that installs high arch staples that will not crush the thermostat wire cable. I run “loose” runs that can be “stretched” when necessary.

      "Thin copper strips|||B079NXCN6B ★☆☆☆☆ [2020-04-17] <b>Started peeling off in less than a day</b> It doesn't stay stuck to my wall. I followed the instructions and watched the video beforehand. I wiped the wall with a damp microfiber to remove any dust and let it dry. I then applied the Ghost Wire starting at one end, peeling about a foot of the backing off at a time, smoothing it and rubbing it to the wall. Working the wrinkles out as I went along. Within one day, both ends of the run had about 6 inches peeling off the wall. Three days later, and both ends are now peeled off about 2 feet. Every morning I've tried to rub it back to the wall. My walls do have a very slight orange peel texture. Perhaps on a smooth finish the Ghost Wire would adhere better. I have not attempted to paint over it yet (and likely won't since it doesn't stay on). The total length of my application was 11.5 feet. Beyond the issue of it not remaining adhered, there were a couple other issues as well. First, there's about 1/8 of clear adhesive which is not covered by the white surface material running down the entire length of the roll. This is very visible (and sticky feeling). I was hoping that I could spray some wall texture over it since paint will likely not cover it correctly. I also snapped off my exposed ends when attaching the end connectors. Since the copper is very thin, any etching done with a razor blade to cleanly expose the copper strips weakens it to the point that any flex will shear it off. I had to peel back and use scissors, leaving a small flap rather than a nice clean transition. My Ghost Wire also was quite wrinkled from being rolled up. The manufacturer states that it's a known issue and recommends a heatgun/hairdryer to remedy so I expected that going in I liked the idea of this product. If it would have stayed on the wall, it would have been great. Even with the problems I had, I could see this working well if run under a carpet. I'm contemplating using a router to notch a shallow channel in the drywall and then just mud over the inserted wire. [update] A week later, and it's completely peeled off. Not an inch is left stuck to the wall. It's just hanging between the two connector blocks that are screwed in."

This wire is made from oxygen-free copper with a little silver and tin to protect it, which is especially important when the wire is carrying high current. It is easy to strip, readily accepts solder, crimp, compression, or butt connectors so you can make reliable connections and splices. The manufacturer also includes some heat-shrink tubing with this product but its small diameter (only a little larger than each insulated conductor itself) didn’t make it particularly useful. I did a high current test to measure the wire's resistance and found it to be 0.0025 ohms/ft., just what it should be for AWG 14 copper, so, this is definitely a high quality product.",

      "copper core|||B0CV7XP7JN ★★★★★ [2023-11-22] <b>True Marine Grade Tinned Copper Wire</b> So I really wanted to find out what makes good wire. Turns out there’s a few factors when determining a quality wire. 1. Copper is better than aluminum, as (semi) precious metals such as silver, gold , platinum etc. are superior, however, cost prohibitive. 2.copper should be bright and 3. The wire jacket should not show any wear or distinguishable defect with the heat of a cigarette applied to it. Makes sense for scenarios when a fire may be present especially on motor vehicles. 3. Must exhibit moderate to good flexibility. 4.the shielding must be smooth throughout. If not, that means the wire has not been produced be acceptable standards. Unevenness of the wire core may create sliding within the shielding due to looseness created. In my testing this wire meets all these requirements with only a slight mark off for slight mark left after the cigarette test. I think that this is adequate wire for anyone’s build requiring 18 gauge marine grade wire. The tin coated copper is even and well applied. The copper is on the rigid side, however, acceptable for good quality in terms of flexibility. I don’t think you would be disappointed with choosing this, especially, if your other choice is cheaper copper clad aluminum.",
      "Oxygen-free copper core|||B0BWGXD6BW ★★★★★ [2023-07-21] <b>Nice design</b> This product has proven to be an excellent choice for my electrical projects, offering several key features that make it stand out from other wires on the market. The use of tinned copper wire is a significant advantage of this silicone wire. The tin layer serves as a protective barrier for the inner oxygen-free copper, preventing it from being oxidized. This feature enhances the wire's longevity and ensures consistent performance over time, even in demanding conditions. The soft silicone insulator on this wire makes it highly flexible, making it easy to handle and maneuver during installations. This flexibility is a real benefit when working in tight spaces or intricate electrical setups, as it allows for smooth routing and minimizes the risk of wire kinking or damage. The availability of six different colors in the spools is a practical and thoughtful feature. It makes it easy to distinguish between wires and simplifies identification in complex wiring configurations. This color-coding system has been invaluable in my projects, enabling me to work more efficiently and avoid any potential wiring errors. With its rating for all under 600V devices and a rated current of 12A, this silicone wire is suitable for a wide range of applications. Whether it's low-voltage electronic projects, DIY circuits, or even some home appliances, this wire can handle the task with ease and reliability.",

I also like to use this wire for various other hobby projects where flexibility is required for making or breaking plug-in connections. It can withstand a lot of flexing due to both the fine stranding and the thick. but soft. silicone insulation. The wire is marked at regular intervals with conductor size and insulation temperature ratings. It is not listed, nor is it appropriate for building wiring. I can recommend this product with confidence.",

      "Top quality tinned copper|||B0CN768S54 ★★★★★ [2024-01-28] <b>Quality material and true to gauge</b> If you are a tinkerer and a DIY fixer like I am, you know you can never have enough good quality wire laying around the house. I found this wire to be a true 16 gauge, a great material (top quality tinned copper), and it's insulated well enough to use outdoors if necessary. What more can you ask for? This is my first time getting a product from this company, but I'm so happy with the quality of this wire, that I would consider checking out their other items as well. The wire is pliable and easy to run. Because of the thickness, you want to make sure you've got a quality pair of cutters. Good quality materials are the most important part of any project, so I would definitely recommend this wire! Pleased with it.",

It sure looks like 14 gauge copper center and the jacket is thick, easy to cut/strip and it should hold up well exposed to the elements and buried underground. Install in warm weather though or you'll have trouble bending the wire. My only quibble is the wire is stiff - but then you do get a thick and durable jacket.

The wire inside is copper as well, tin coated. I scraped the coating off to be sure and it is copper. Because I hate aluminum wires. Very flexible wire love the silicone coating.

The tin over copper is useless to me but once you melt the tin off what do you have?? Orange copper boys. Just check out the weight compared to a length of copper wire of the same gauge and aluminum of the same gauge. I have weighed this wire and it matches weight by foot of similarly selected copper core wire.

      "Copper tinned|||B07111R7N8 ★★★★★ [2022-03-05] <b>FOR CAR AUDIO PEOPLE…</b> I was looking for copper tinned lugs for my car audio build. I usually buy my lugs directly from sky high car audio, but I was in a bit of a money pinch so $10 for a pack of 10 didn’t seem that worth it at the time. I ended up coming across these bad boys, which happened to be the best deal around. 50 lugs for less than $40. Honestly I was pretty hyped. I ended up remember that car audio 1/0 is not standard 1/0 welding wire. It’s actually oversized 1/0…so right in between 1/0-2/0. I decided to go for the 2/0 lugs and purchased 50 of them. I tested it out on 1/0 sky high wire and it fit like a GLOVE. The 2/0 lug itself is smaller than sky high 1/0 lug, which was kinda nice because I am working on tight space. I did try the 2/0 lug on some sky high 2/0 and there’s no chance it would go in. Maybe if you force a ton, but even then it won’t work. I couldn’t even get the head of the wire in and these lugs are flared outwards too. I haven’t crimped them yet but I will soon, I’ll update the review when I get to crimping stage. But as of now, they get a 5/5 for fitting oversized 1/0 car audio wire. Update 3/6/22: crimping is absolutely awesome. I have two types of crimpers, hydraulics and handheld $30 crimpers from amazon. I decided to use the handheld crimper, even though it doesn't go up to 2/0 size. Stuck it on the 1/0 setting and did 2 crimps at the bottom and top of the lug. Had my dad pull one end of the wire while I held the lug end of the wire. We both pulled as hard as we could and it didn't even move. I'd say they work as intended.",

The wire features a solid and heavy-duty jacket that instills a sense of durability and reliability. It can withstand moderate impacts and rough handling without compromising its integrity. This rugged construction ensures that the wire can handle the demands of various electrical applications, making it suitable for both professional and DIY projects. Despite its solid construction, the wire remains surprisingly flexible and soft. It easily bends and maneuvers around corners, allowing for convenient routing and installation. The flexibility of the wire is especially useful when working in tight spaces or when dealing with complex wiring configurations. Its softness adds to the ease of handling and makes it effortless to work with during installations. I primarily utilized this wire as a tool power cable, connecting power tools and equipment to a power source. Throughout my projects, the wire performed flawlessly, delivering a consistent and reliable power supply. I encountered no issues with power transmission or connectivity. The tinned copper construction of the wire ensures excellent conductivity, minimizing any potential voltage drops or interference, resulting in efficient and uninterrupted operation of my tools. Additionally, the 16-gauge thickness of the wire is well-suited for most power applications. It offers ample current-carrying capacity for typical household tools and equipment, providing a safe and stable power supply.

I putter around with offgrid solar power and battery setups, have several at home in addition to my grid-tied system and like to help friends set their own systems up as well. For that you really need some good heavy high-quality copper wire, because once you get the system down to 12 or 24v, you need to pull quite a few amps to power reasonable-sized inverters, and that means thick copper, and sometimes multiple strands of it. I create my own power cables using copper crimping ends, sometims with two parallel 4AWG lenghs used in parallel as a single cable, and kept as short as feasible. This cable works well for that. It’s reasonably flexible and seems to take the power just fine. I consider copper to be a precious metal; won’t be all that long until it costs a lot more than it does now, because the ore grades are falling inexorably around the world, it’s getting more energetically remote. So I think of owning spare high-quality copper wires as an investment for the future just like gold or silver, only a lot more useful and a lot cheaper.

I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you got your rolls mixed up. I was actually amazed at what I received for less than 10 dollars! It's definitely pure copper for one thing. Some cheaper wires I've bought in the past boast a pure copper conductor, and they were truthful, but what they didn't say was that the insulator was way thicker than it needed to be and the conductor was a gossimer thin 3 or 4 strands.... Southwire sent exactly what they promised. A quality, pure copper strand primary wire all neat on a roll, ready for me to use on many various applications. I can't say for sure that I received exactly 100 feet, but I'll tell you one thing... For 9 bucks I won't lose sleep over a foot or 2 if it isn't quite what it should be. It's good wire at almost half the price it should be. I challenge anyone to find 100 feet of better wire for anything even close to this price.

Conductor appears to be pure copper strands, which is as claimed, not copper coated aluminum. The individual strands are quite fine. I counted 64 strands after stripping.

See photo. - Was easy to strip. - Actually the product seems fairly generic: there is no branding printed on the jacket nor any identification label on the roll. But you weren't expecting a mainstream brand anyhow, and it's just outdoor low voltage wire. It's fine. Looks like it will hold up in the garden. - One thing to keep in mind is that because it's bare copper wire (not tined, like marine wire) the connections are subject to corrosion from moisture and humidity. Make sure to use a connector method that either bonds the ends (solder) or creates a waterproof barrier to prevent this. - At the time I ordered the 16/2 165ft roll was $41, making it an okay deal, considering it's generic wire. - Hope this helps"

The red and black conductors are not fused as is often common for this type of wire.

      "Steel wire|||B001EX57ZK ★★★★★ [2020-09-07] <b>Excellent. Buy this!</b> It's odd to see people downgrading this stuff for being exactly the way it's supposed to be. I have bought this twice because it's strong, predictable, flexible enough to wrap around itself by hand on a screw eye, absolutely rust free, and forgiving of my putting a ridiculous amount of tension on it. It will hold my excessive unhealthy weight. I can shove spare extra lumber on top of this wire after stringing it across the bottom edges of open rafters in the garage. Has never broken nor stretched over the 24 inch spaces it spans. ALL steel wire will stretch, depending on how you work it, over longer distances. However, I haven't re-tensioned the first roll at all since stringing a bunch of lights three years ago. One run is 53 feet with 50 lights on it. I needed something like this because it's ruinous to the light string to put any meaningful tension directly to a string and so you have to support the string on something like this. Don't bother with cables as that's huge and expensive overkill and they're hard to terminate. Don't use poly or fabric line; they WILL sag. If you have problems with the wire keeping some of its curl, that's absolutely normal. It's coiled steel! Add much tension and then back off a bit. Remember that light strings have a significant straightening effect. If it's snarling when you try to unwind it, most likely you're uncoiling from the outside, not the inside end. Been that way since they invented the stuff a few centuries ago. OR you can unroll it from the outside end after mounting it like a wheel to a horizontal bar (F-clamp, broom handle or pipe propped in a step ladder, and such).",

I didn't compare the ohm value of the new wire to the factory wire. I just knew the combined resistance of the parallel grids needed to be between 3.9-4.5 ohms. Stringing the failed grid took some trial and error (first attempt, i broke the wire). I eventually got a method to tighten each \"run\". The overall resistance was right at 4.5 ohms. The wire is tough and reasonably difficult to break. I was pulling the runs with hemostatic clamps and the wire held up. I only broke it when i was attempting to wrap around a screw too aggressively.

Thankfully the conductors themselves are solid copper wire and not copper clad aluminum otherwise known as CCA.

      "Copper Clad Aluminum (CCA)|||B0CH2R3XNH ★★★★☆ [2023-11-18] <b>Copper Clad * ALUMINUM * for maybe 10 amps</b> This product sort of tricked me. I saw 12/2 wire and I’m just so used to everything being copper that I didn’t notice this listing is for CCA (Copper Clad Aluminum). That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but if - like me - you see 12 AWG and have a knee jerk expectation this can carry twenty amps then you’re going to be disappointed. That said, you don’t normally need that kind of amperage in a low voltage system anyway. What tipped me off was measuring the resistance. When I join the two ends of this roll to get a 240-ft loop, I measure 1.0 ohms (after subtracting out 0.1 for my test leads). That’s about double what I’d expect from 12 AWG copper, and puts it more in the neighborhood of 16 AWG copper. So we’re looking at wire here that can carry something in the neighborhood of ten amps — assuming you have enough voltage to even make that happen. This is a consideration that I don’t see mentioned in the product listing at the time of this writing. And that’s probably fine for most garden lighting projects (up to maybe 100W, hopefully not all going down one wire). LED lights these days really don’t use a whole lot of power. So if this product meets your needs then by all means go for it. I see nothing to complain about in terms of build quality and fully expect it to survive direct burial operation. I just want to make sure you’re not under-sizing your wire. And, just to be clear, this wire is for low voltage applications. If you’re looking to carry line voltage without running conduit then you probably want UF-B wire instead and there are rules about how deep you have to bury it (usually one foot at the very least — and that’s assuming you have ground fault protection).",

Southwire sent exactly what they promised. A quality, pure copper strand primary wire all neat on a roll, ready for me to use on many various applications. I can't say for sure that I received exactly 100 feet, but I'll tell you one thing... For 9 bucks I won't lose sleep over a foot or 2 if it isn't quite what it should be. It's good wire at almost half the price it should be. I challenge anyone to find 100 feet of better wire for anything even close to this price.

It has the preferred characteristics of copper (low resistance and flexibility) with the corrosion resistance of tin. I have had to throw away pure copper wire from the 70s since it develops green oxidation and is a pain to clean but have yet to have to clean tinned copper before crimping or soldering. This wire has fewer strands that are larger and a heavy PVC outer coating, compared to the small strand silicon coated wire I use for RC helicopters. This makes it stiffer, easier to route, and tougher. I wouldn't hesitate to walk on this wire or pull it across metal edges that would cut silicon insulation. The larger strands are also better for crimping since smaller strands are more likely to break at the crimp. The only negative is the large outer diameter will limit the number of runs you can have in small spaces. Excellent wire! Recommended!",

I had been using 1/4 wire loom with the PVC insulated 12 gauge wire but I did have to go buy 3/8 wire loom for these pair of 12 gauge wires, so it's a little bit thinker than your standard stranded wire.

      "Multiple small conductor strands|||B08FD8YC62 ★★★★★ [2023-06-02] <b>Great wire</b> This wire is perfect for high heat and high amperage circuits for automotive work. People that gave it low reviews do to the small individual strands of wire don't understand how electricity flows through wire. Multiple small conductor strands of wire can flow more amperage through them than the same gauge of wire with 1 large conductor of wire or with the same gauge of wire made with multiple strands of large conductors. The reason why is because electricity flows in a field around the conductors and not through the conductor. So when you have wire wire made of many small strands it has a larger surface area for the electricity to flow around.",
      "Fine strands|||B0CMTTT3PR ★★★★★ [2024-04-10] <b>Actually heat resistant, at least short-term, and insulation is good thickness and softness</b> With this being sold as silicone insulation, I tested it for heat resistance by holding the end directly in a gas stove flame for one minute. After a minute of flame contact, the insulation was chalky and white over about 1/2 inch, and the 1/4 inch that was directly in the flame was significantly weakened. The bottom part that got the most heat was easily peeled off with a fingernail. The top part lost about half its thickness, becoming the white chalky powder that didn’t stay attached, but the lower layers were still functional insulation. The insulation that was right next to the flame lost its gloss but stayed flexible and fairly tough. The portion of insulation just 1/2 inch away from the flame was completely unaffected despite probably reaching a few hundred degrees F in temperature. Seriously impressive results for generic wire, and this appears to be actual silicone insulation. The usual concern I have with off-brand wire like this is that the insulation will have one of a few common problems: the most common is being excessively thick to give the impression that the wire is lower-gauge than it actually is, and then it’s made very soft to keep it flexible so it ends up weak and vulnerable to damage. The other common problem I’ve found is thin, hard insulation and coarse wire stranding so the wire has too much “memory,” making it a pain to work with while still not offering much toughness. This wiring is in the middle, with a good moderate insulation thickness, fine strands, and what seems to be a good balance of flexibility and protection from the insulation. It’s still on the soft side, but feels like it will be fairly tough. It still definitely feels like cheap wire to me, but it’s a good price and it should get the job done.",

It is flexible and plenty resilient. The individual multi-strand leads are nice and solder well but the jacketing of the leads tends to draw up if you go higher than say 750 degrees and more than a couple seconds contact time. You should know that the inner jacketing of the individual leads is somewhat soft as well which helps with flexibility however can easily be nicked or accidentally stripped away during stripping of the outer jack for readying for connector assembly so cut your lengths a touch long in case you have to re-strip.

Regarding directions, they are excellent. Written in clear, concise, and informative American English. The way the two halves nest together for carrying and each stand have carrying hands on 3 sides makes carrying them convenient. Unfortunately, while they got lots right, the product feels half baked; while it can be very useful now, hopefully the next version will correct some of the following shortcomings. The location on the rack for storing the stand stacking pins does NOT work, because the channel where they go is wider than the pins' diameter, so they just fall out. In other words, there is no mechanical catch or other device to hold the pins in their storage location. This problem could have been easily fixed with four small 3/8 to ½ inch button magnet, one pair at each end of the two storage channels. A quick search shows that four rare earth magnets would add only slightly more than 1 cent ($0.0125) to the materials cost of the product. My other initial concern is will the ¾ to 1 inch conduit or rigid pipe they recommend for suspending spools of wire between the supports stay in place if the wire is pulled off the spools at an angle toward either support vs perpendicular to the support pipe and parallel to the supports or will the pipe slip out of the hole in the stand.",

The cords are permanently attached to the panels and cannot be replaced, so I didn't want them exposed constantly to sunlight and weather. So I ordered a 10' roll of the 3/8th\" tubing. I measure out how much cable length I'd need plus a little slack, then I wrapped the excess around one or both of the panel/camera mounts (depending on how much unused cable length there'd be) and wrapped self-bonding silicone tape around the cable to secure/waterproof/protect it. Then I cut an appropriate length of the split tubing and slipped it over the exposed cable between the two, then for some cameras where necessary I cut a smaller piece or two and added them to the small amount of slack I left after the wrapping. Where appropriate I wrapped a small amount of the silicone tape on the ends to keep it in place/further waterproof it. This gives a clean, finished, and professional look. I was impressed with the results so much I've ordered more additional cameras, as well as to help reorganize some computer cable routing.

For years I have used a system where I disconnect my electric fence by hand to open my gates without getting shocked. I dug a small trench about 6\" deep under a couple of my gates and buried the RiteFENCE, and left each end protrude out of the ground about two feet to connect to one of the lower existing fence wires so as not to disconnect the continuous circuit at any time when opening gates now. I chose the 6\" depth to bury the heavily insulated RiteFENCE since in addition to moving livestock through the gates, I also drive vehicles and farm implements through the gates as well. The RiteFENCE is very sturdy and rigid, and the 12-½ gauge took some time to straighten out to fit flat and neatly into the trenches I dug and placed the wire into, but this is a definite plus for electric fence wire to be used on a farm or ranch. The RiteFENCE doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and has a thick outer coating with the inner wire apparently coated as well for the 'double insulation' aspect. When installing, I also cut back a couple of inches of the RiteFENCE on each end and used a heavy duty crimp connection to the barb wire fencing I use. Once crimped, I neatly wrapped the connections with quality electrical tape to seal from the elements. The RiteFENCE is going to be ideal for many other underground connection needs I have around the farm. I would highly recommend any farmers and ranchers who run electric fence to give the RiteFENCE a try if you want to eliminate the risk of a nasty shock, especially with the higher powered fence chargers. The price point seems very fair and in fact is actually a little cheaper than what I saw at my local farm supply store. Highly recommend!"

      "More stiff compared to big brands|||B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★☆ [2023-06-05] <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option.

The light grey color looks a lot better than the cheap black and white cables that come with electronic devices. In terms of performance, I’ve found them to be fast. They support PD3.0 fast charging. I’m using them with the Voltme 30W GaN III charger bloc, and I’ve tried them directly to my LG G7 phone as well as with an Eazpower wireless charger – these combinations charge my phone more than twice as fast as my original LG charger and cable.

You can use it to power low-mid power stereo equipment (probably would go bigger for over 1k watts). Use it to run new circuits on the interior like a few more 12v power points or USB chargers for phones, powering 12V displays or really anything on the interior of the vehicle.

Mine came as a twisted mess that looks unprofessional and not really useable for anything more than auto speaker wire. Looks like just a haphazard cut from a much larger spool. Biggest complaint is it stinks up whatever room it is in. It is potent and I think the manufacturer knew this because it came double bagged. I thought the busted sauce that was in the Amazon box this came together in was what smelled up the box but several days later it's definitely the wire as I can smell it from 8 feet away. The price isn't bad and the copper wire itself seems ok. But the jacket used isn't useable for any code regulated work and it's only marking is the meter length interval.

      "Aesthetically pleasing cloth covering|||B0BRN8DWTL ★★★★★ [2023-03-07] <b>Beautiful appearance and high quality vintage style appliance wire</b> I was immediately struck that the cloth covering on this wire is so aesthetically pleasing. It looks and feels great to the touch; much better than the cloth covered wire from back in the day. I suspect the reason is that the modern 'cloth' contains some synthetics that weren't available 75 years ago. But this wire fits in fine with genuine vintage items, and this cloth is much more durable than the old stuff. I will be using it to rewire an old vintage lamp to get rid of the vinyl/plastic modern wire. I think it is a good choice to re-wire a valuable antique item as well. This wire is flexible but not as limp as most appliance wire. At first I thought the reason must be solid copper instead of stranded copper inside, which would be very strange. It's stranded not solid, however, and the lack of limpness is because the black-coated and white-coated copper stranded wires inside are embedded in a PVC 'cord' that is completely solid. In other words, there isn't a PVC tubing containing the 2 inner wires but rather a solid mass of PVC. Thus the whole thing is sturdier and heftier than it would be if it were a cloth covering over a PVC tubing containing 2 wires. Well done, as the resulting heft makes this wire seem substantial which adds a beautiful aesthetic to any vintage item. Once my re-wiring job is done if I learn any more I'll come back and edit this review.",

It is a sturdy construction aid, and a close rendition of the name brand that it tries to duplicate. Most everyone that works with electrical wiring has had to build a wire dispenser out of 2 x 4’s and such. This is definitely a better option, except when it comes time to snap them together and put them into the back of your truck or van! The instructions are well laid out and explain all kinds of uses. They also instruct you on how to snap this together for storing or to make a seat. Problem is, they don’t snap. They slide into place and then unslide as soon as they bounce around a bit driving down the road, or if you try to pick them up. They also come with alignment pins to make a 36” high work bench. The indents for storing the pins are so loose that I had to wrap them in a baggie so they would be tight enough to stay stowed away. If you don’t keep those pins with the dispenser, you won’t have them if you need a taller work bench. Overall I rated these a 3 star because two of the important features have a huge shortcoming.

Each wire comes on it's own individual plastic reel, but they are not labeled. The actual wire sheathing IS labeled with the wires size and capacity. Speaking of the wire sheathing, it is very SOFT, leading to a wire that's very flexible but at the cost of abrasion resistance. You can easily strip the sheathing from the wire with your finger nails. The box of 6 colors I ordered came with a small number of small colored zip ties that correspond to each color of wire in the box, a very nice touch."

      "Wheel-printed text on jacket|||B0C27YYCXK ★★★★★ [2023-10-15] <b>3-conductor stranded copper 22AWG wire</b> I needed some small 3-conductor wire for a project and I think this will do nicely. It is unshielded, with PVC jacket and insulation. There is no filler (like cotton rope or talc or anything) between the jacket and the conductors, so it does retain some shape memory -- which is neither good nor bad. It is reasonably-flexible and does straighten out easily-enough, just as I anticipated from the product photos. It came in a plain plastic bag as a coil of about 6\" diameter, secured by two zip ties. For a relatively short length of wire like this, this is very good packaging: It wasn't cinched down into a tight bunch with a hundred kinks to work out, or wound onto a little spool that would impart a tight spiral twist. It will be easy to use what I need while keeping the coil from getting too messy. The jacket and conductor insulation both strip off with a level of ease that is familiar from other wires that I've used professionally. I have no way of verifying the oxygen-free claim, but the conductor strands themselves appear to be (and act like) solid copper, not copper-clad aluminum like many inexpensive wires have these days. I anticipate that it will work very well. The jacket is wheel-printed with the following text: \"AWM 2464 22AWG 80°C 300V VW-1 AWM I VW-1 A 22AWG 80°C 300V FT1 ZHENFENG\"",

The ten foot roll is the perfect size for small projects. This wire comes neatly wound on a plastic spool and shrink wrapped to avoid oxidation. It has a high quality PVC shield, which isn't very easy to strip. It provides plenty of insulation. The thick shielding causes this wire to spring off the spool, so as soon as I opened it, I had to rewind it and secure it with a rubber band. The wire is properly marked and is UL listed. This seems to be high quality wire, but I have limited experience with electric wiring. Fortunately, this is the perfect size for testing, and it is available in other length options, so it's worth experimenting before committing to a larger project.",

Each wire comes on it's own individual plastic reel, but they are not labeled. The actual wire sheathing IS labeled with the wires size and capacity. Speaking of the wire sheathing, it is very SOFT, leading to a wire that's very flexible but at the cost of abrasion resistance. You can easily strip the sheathing from the wire with your finger nails. The box of 6 colors I ordered came with a small number of small colored zip ties that correspond to each color of wire in the box, a very nice touch.",

I've been using very similar wire, and will be using this wire, for primary power on my larger RC planes. The tinning and fine stranding make it easy to solder into various connectors and the flexibility allows this relatively large conductor to be easily tucked away inside my models. The high temperature rating of the insulation ensures that it can handle the heavy, usually short-term amperages that today's advanced RC battery and motor technology demand. I also like to use this wire for various other hobby projects where flexibility is required for making or breaking plug-in connections. It can withstand a lot of flexing due to both the fine stranding and the thick. but soft. silicone insulation. The wire is marked at regular intervals with conductor size and insulation temperature ratings. It is not listed, nor is it appropriate for building wiring.

Because it is water and oil resistant, the jacket should last a very long time against whatever gets flung onto it. Because it essentially has two jackets, it is more resistant to abuse, the extra padding slightly helps prevent radio interference in and out as well.

      "U.L. Listed|||B01KWBPC7M ★★★★★ [2020-06-04] <b>Very decent wire. In depth review & Pics</b> Running some permanent LED strips in the living room vaulted ceiling. Needed wire to run through the attic from the LED strips to a controller about 22 feet away. Wanted something heavier than the 22 gauge wire you find everywhere, and I wanted 100 foot spool Those two combinations limited what was out there. Settled on this because A) 18 gauge (voltage drop would be less than if I used 22 gauge), B) wires were Color coded as colors you would find in the LED strip (Red, Green, Blue, White), and it is Stranded (not solid) core wire (didn't want to try to use thermostat wire). So to address some of the reviews found on here, I looked at several different things and gave pictures. The wire is listed as 18 gauge. I measured with my caliper, and one wire measured between .98 mm and 1.02 mm. Since I am not a pro at this, and depending how tight my caliper got is why the range. Sufficient to say it is close enough to 18 gauge wire per color. The wire comes in a nice cardboard spool. I gave a few pictures of the wire up close. A few things of note: The wire is labelled every two feet the current remaining length. The wire is U.L. Listed. Both were nice and the measurement labeling surprising they went through that trouble. None of the wires were corroded (as one reviewer had as an issue). My guess it was a damaged batch. There are four wires in the sleeve. The colors of each wire are clear to see when removed. Red, Green, Blue & White. I stripped with small snips (diagonal cutters) and did not use a professional stripper (I do have one). I found it stripped just fine and, I did not have strand breakage. I did count the strands for one of the wires: 15 strands for those interested. Googling seems to tell me it can be from 7 to 65 depending on the design. Next, I soldered the wire to an LED strip. I pre-tinned the LED strip (I also used sand paper to rough-up the copper tabs), and I also pre-tinned the wire. It all soldered just fine, and as can be seen in the pictures, the plastic did not self destruct or melt, etc. I will say that 18 gauge is about the largest gauge you could use to solder against LED strips, as there is definitely not much room to play there. The plastic did not melt as another reviewer seemed to of had that issue. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase. The wire appears to be a winner. I only wish they offered 5 or 6 conductor wire for those LED strips with RGBWW (Red, Green, Blue, Warm white, Cool white). Even with my current strips, would have been nice to be able to upgrade without having to re-run wire. Oh well, happy anyway!",

Mine came as a twisted mess that looks unprofessional and not really useable for anything more than auto speaker wire. Looks like just a haphazard cut from a much larger spool. Biggest complaint is it stinks up whatever room it is in. It is potent and I think the manufacturer knew this because it came double bagged. I thought the busted sauce that was in the Amazon box this came together in was what smelled up the box but several days later it's definitely the wire as I can smell it from 8 feet away. The price isn't bad and the copper wire itself seems ok. But the jacket used isn't useable for any code regulated work and it's only marking is the meter length interval.

I bought it for an Electric Dryer repair, which I know is probably not what this wire should be used for, but my electrician friend recommended it. When it came time to mark the wire with a sharpie for hot/neutral/ground it wouldn't hold a sharpie mark. Our hands ended up pink from the red sharpie we used for the hot. Then when we would strip it, we got fiberglass everywhere, which was a minor annoyance. The worst part was trying to singe the fabric so it wasn't around the actual wire when we made the connection. Obviously, since this wire is high-temp rated that was a chore. I give it four stars because I'm pretty sure I misused what this wire was meant for, and probably didn't know of the proper way to strip it. However, the fact that it doesn't hold a mark for hot (which is code in my state), is a ding against it.",

I only hesitate saying a joy, because it sounds to corny... There's about a million different uses and projects that this wire would be perfect for, you'll certainly run out of wire before you run out of projects.

I'm not sure if maybe they just got some bad wire in their shipment, but this looks like pretty decent hookup wire. I don't intend on using this for high current situations, and I don't crimp the bare wire in my terminal lugs (I usually crimp on pins and at times add a touch of solder if needed). As you can see in the picture, the copper cladding looks just fine and I had no strands break off when I stripped the PVC jacket off. I also wiggled the strands around (that's why it looks so messy) and I had none break off from bending. The true test is over time to see if I have any issues with oxidation or anything else, but so far this wire seems to be just fine. I did not check the diameter of the wire to verify it it was 16 Gauge or not. I'll just say that for my application, it's just fine.

My methodology for Vine Program products is to give a more thorough -- often product-destructive -- review. If I like the product, I buy my own version of it, otherwise, it gets donated post-testing. I also may include my opinion on the product's value proposition to the market. REVIEW: -------------------------------- If I was to give a description that people might be able to reference, I'd say this feels like the power cord you'd find on a high-end power tool. It's thick, and doesn't have a strong odor (common in cheaper products). Each comes with some zipties and a few pieces of heat-shrink if you need it. Inspection of the individual wires does seem to indicate tinned copper (instead of tinned aluminum), but I'd need a better device to really tell. At slightly over ~$1/ft, it's not a bad deal if you just need it in a pinch for a project. END NOTE: -------------------------------- And with all the reviews I do, if there's ever a problem with this product, I will edit (if able) to update this review. These will be denoted in an \"UPDATES\" section.",

I picked this up to finally put my aftermarket subwoofer and amp in my car after putting it off for a long time. Often enough, a lot of audio systems are wired up using 16 or 18 gauge wire, but I wanted something thicker to transmit more efficiently and not possibly run hot, so this 14 gauge spool was perfect. At 20 cents per foot, it is a good value. Now I can't say that my ear can distinguish any difference in audio, but I like knowing the thicker wire is there and will handle whatever I throw at it.",

Unlike some low voltage landscape lighting cables, this does not look appropriate for direct burial. There are however, 2 layers of insulation to the cable: color coded (red and black) insulators on each conductor and a thicker protective insulator on the exterior. The wire gauge is quite light at #18, so it is especially good for LED lights which don't draw much current. I would also feel comfortable using it on a single halogen fixture at 20 watts or less. Overall the thin profile of the cable lends itself to being able to tuck it away easily and out of sight. I will likely be using it under a deck to power LV light fixtures.",

It is very flexible but durable and has a rather hefty PVC outer jacket. A great feature is that the wires are copper tinned providing the option of sodering connections. Having 8 conductors affords a nice variety of plausible applications. The item appears as described by the seller, although the wire may be a bit shy of a true 18 guage. Accordingly, it would be best to exercise caution as to the amount of current in which you plan to use with this wire. I am pleased with this item and believe you will be as well. Therefore, Dr. T. recommends this product with the caveat that it may not have a true 18 guage capacity.",

The insulation is rugged PVC so it can be buried or exposed to wet conditions. It should not be used for 120v AC wiring. I confess that I intend to use this indoors for LED strip lighting, so the 16 gauge is overkill for me. I have complete confidence that my uses will be handled with no problem by this wire. The wire is sent on a convenient spool. One strand has smooth insulation and the other is ribbed for easily keeping the polarity right. The smooth strand has the labelling in white. The spool and the wire are both labelled as UL listed. I give it five stars because it is built for wet and outdoors conditions, and thus is more versatile.",

It’s a great wire for wiring low-voltage remote control deviced. Although the PVC insulation has a maximum voltage rating of 150 volts, this wire shouldn’t be used in circuits operating at voltages higher than 30 to 50 volts. I use a lot of low-voltage direct burial cable for everything from landscape lighting to irrigation valve control circuits. There are many brands to choose from and they all perform splendidly but none of them is inexpensive as this Honderson wire at approximately 24 cents a foot. This is directburial wire, but you do need to be aware of where you are burying it and the depth that you are burying it at so it’s not accidentally damaged. In some cases, in some locations, good wiring practices does call for it to be run in conduit.",

The insulation on each wire is thick and durable PVC and the outer jacket is flexible, yet durable PVC material. The wires inside the outer jacket are not bonded to the outer jacket, instead, they float inside the outer jacket. This allows the user to easily pull the wires out of the jacket as needed. This wire would make an excellent automotive or marine wire harness for multiple lights that require separate control.

The most significant thing that I noted right away is that although this has a PVC jacket it is significantly more compliant than some others that need to be uncoiled and back-bent to get the curlies out. This wire has a softer jacket that could be mistaken for rubber. It's almost as flexible as a professional microphone cable. Of course this doesn't matter a whole lot if you are burying it, but I have other uses where the flexibility is a plus. And of course with the heinous increase in the use of CCA (copper-clad aluminum), you now have to be careful what you buy.

I've now ordered this 16 Gauge, UL 2464 Tinned Copper Stranded Wire for LED Lighting in 3 different flavors. I got the 3 wire / conductor, the 5 wire, and now the 4 wire. The 5 wire is great for LEDs with a DC dimmer (AC - hot, neutral, ground & DC positive, negative for my dimmer switch). Boom! all done 1 cable. I got this 4 wire for my third LED high bay; I already had an available ground in the rafters next to the fixture. I ran the cable down and 2 AC wires (hot to toggle switch, neutral to neutral) & 2 wires for DC dimmer. Done. The 3 wire I used for my first High Bay - I had another two wire cable for the dimmer. I had to zip-tie those two together. The wire is - nice supple / pliable PVC insulated 1/4\" outside diameter 16 gauge tinned copper. The Engineering Tool Box specs this wire at 6 amp carrying capacity up to 1000v @ 30 deg. C (86 F) ambient temperature. There is a .71 correction factor for temperatures between 41 - 45 deg. C (105 - 113 deg. F) So: 6(amps) x .71 = 4.26 4.26 amps is enough amperage for (3) 150w LED lamps. I'm using each cable for one fixture – I prefer to have the amperage up there for additions and the extra cost is minimal. I don't mind the extra cost for the marine rated tinned copper, but this company sells the same cable in the non-tinned flavor also. This is quality cable and makes for quick easy installations. I'll call that 5 Stars Thanks for Reading Tip: Don't get your crires wossed. Make a schematic – if you put AC power on the DC side your likely to fry your lamp.",

I bought the package of 6-color 28 AWG Solid wire. Not the silicone variety, not stranded. Have measured the tinned core diameter to be 28 AWG. Clear lettering on the PVC insulation says 300V. So, it is basically as advertised ... but still, not exactly what I wanted. For bodging and wrapping electronic projects, it is better to have thinner insulation ... the jacket on this wire is exceptionally thick for the gauge. It is impossible to fish this through PCB journals without drilling them out. Still, it will be useful, as wraps nicely around posts, and seems a good value. Am left a little puzzled though, what the industrial application is for a thin wire like this, with such thick insulation.",

      "Industrial-grade PVC insulation|||B07Y7S1BRN ★★★★★ [2023-08-20] <b>Illuminate Your Landscape: Quality Wire for a Brilliant Outdoor Experience.</b> In the realm of outdoor landscaping projects, the quality of materials is paramount. And in our recent endeavor, the direct burial landscape light wire we procured became a star player. Boasting robust construction, it met our criteria both in terms of price and performance. The industrial-grade PVC insulation is a testament to its durability, ensuring longevity even in demanding outdoor conditions. As a 2-wire product, it further simplifies installations. A thoughtful touch is the distinctive design of each wire: one side is smoothly finished, while the other bears grooves, making identification a breeze during setup. However, there's one aspect where the product could be enhanced — its packaging. The wire is sheathed entirely in plastic, and accessing it requires completely removing this protective cover. This might sound like a minor quibble, but when you're deep into the intricacies of landscaping, unwrapping the wire can become a tangled chore, leading to unintended project delays. In conclusion, the landscape light wire has much going for it, and I'd consider repurchasing it for future projects. But a packaging redesign is to facilitate easier unspooling and more convenient storage.",

You should also consider that the insulation is (again clearly stated) PVC, so no-one is trying to trick you here. This is just decent cheap cord to get the job done. Edit: Upon further research, it turns out that you cannot get SPT1 cord unless you drop your gauge down to 18 gauge.

      "PVC insulation|||B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ [2024-02-14] <b>Quality wire in a durable jacket</b> I acquired this cable to wire some repair some existing lights and add supplemental warning lights on my tractor. Wire for rear tractor lighting needs to be run along the underside where brush, sticks, briars claw away at it constantly. More than once, I have had wiring damaged or destroyed. I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications. I really like this wire, and I look forward to using it to upgrade my tractor warning lights in preparation for spring. It would be equally suitable for use on a mowers or trailers as well. I think this product will provide adequate protection for wiring in a tough environment for a long time. In fact, with good end connections, I am hopeful that it will last as long as the equipment.",

I love this stuff because it removes the need for corrugated PVC split-loom. The sheathe acts to protect the wires against abrasion, and if you're running wire in vehicles, with all of their tight turns and sharp edges, you need abrasion protection. I got this to run accessory LED lighting for my Jeep, but I'm considering it for running speakers as well. The individual wires are 14 gauge, which is more than enough for my craziest lighting project. 14 gauge can handle a lot of juice. Overall, this is good wire.

I use 14/2 cable in my landscape lighting for the final connections to groups of LED fixtures. I use 12/2 for distribution over long distances to get to the clusters of fixtures. 14/2 works great in that application and helps to save a little money compared to running 12/2 everywhere. If your cable runs are all short and you have a modest number of LED fixtures then 14/2 may be good enough for the entire system. Note that 14/2 cable has a lower current rating than 12/2 cable, which is counterintuitive given the numbers are getting smaller as ampacity increases.

Using one- and two-conductor cable for everything was starting to create really thick wiring bundles. My solution for some of the low-current circuits is to utilize this space-saving five-conductor cable. 16 gauge is plenty robust for the majority of my needs. (It's rated for up to 11 amps.) I'm especially pleased to be using Oxygen-Free Copper conductors, tinned for oxidation resistance—rather than Copper-Clad Aluminum. This 26-strand cable is very flexible, and the outer PVC jacket seems thick enough to provide the protection I need.",

      "PVC jacket and insulation|||B0C27YYCXK ★★★★★ [2023-10-15] <b>3-conductor stranded copper 22AWG wire</b> I needed some small 3-conductor wire for a project and I think this will do nicely. It is unshielded, with PVC jacket and insulation. There is no filler (like cotton rope or talc or anything) between the jacket and the conductors, so it does retain some shape memory -- which is neither good nor bad. It is reasonably-flexible and does straighten out easily-enough, just as I anticipated from the product photos. It came in a plain plastic bag as a coil of about 6\" diameter, secured by two zip ties. For a relatively short length of wire like this, this is very good packaging: It wasn't cinched down into a tight bunch with a hundred kinks to work out, or wound onto a little spool that would impart a tight spiral twist. It will be easy to use what I need while keeping the coil from getting too messy. The jacket and conductor insulation both strip off with a level of ease that is familiar from other wires that I've used professionally. I have no way of verifying the oxygen-free claim, but the conductor strands themselves appear to be (and act like) solid copper, not copper-clad aluminum like many inexpensive wires have these days. I anticipate that it will work very well. The jacket is wheel-printed with the following text: \"AWM 2464 22AWG 80°C 300V VW-1 AWM I VW-1 A 22AWG 80°C 300V FT1 ZHENFENG\"",

I didn't take any images during the process so excuse the mess but I tried to blur out the areas without this wire. All in all it works fine and I've got no worries this won't perform the task for quite some time. My only point of note is this wire felt a wee stiffer than other PVC wires I've got and it may soften over time but I wouldn't use this in any drag chain or high stressed environment. I did use it in my printers umbilical but it has a fair bit of arc length to move around so it shouldn't kink or bind anywhere. If this does suffer any issues I'll come back and update the review."

I don't know if this is a thousand feet total or a thousand feet per color or 250 meters either way... and I don't care because it's more wire than I'm likely to consume in my lifetime, doing point-to-point wiring on tiny cigarette-pack-sided circuit boards. It may be PCV, but it strips exactly like Tefzel does and as far as I can tell it would be entirely suitable for use wire-wrapping, especially if you solder your wraps like you really should if you're confident in your schematic. This wire is less likely to tarnish than standard silver-plated wire-wrap wire. It's just the right size for data-level or small-signal connections to transistors and ICs, which move very little current and cannot overheat #30 wire. Any smaller and it would be difficult to work with.

This is perfect for use in almost any decent kind of connectors and it is flexible enough to be durable and nice to work with. - Insulation on the individual strands is of very good quality and they are powdered so the outer insulation can be easily removed. - The wire is real copper, with tin plating and the tin plating is of very good quality. This resists corrosion and will carry electricity very well. - Packaging was very good and there are 3 twist ties around the roll of wire, holding it together and keeping it neat. Twist ties are very good because they are much easier to deal with than zip ties and they are reusable. Cons: - Outer insulation is PVC, which will likely become much stiffer in cold weather, but it appears to be good quality PVC, so maybe it won't be too bad. I can't tell right now because the weather here is not cold enough now. - Clearly labeled \"Made in China\". Overall: Excellent quality product.",

      "Plastic insulation predating vinyl|||B0BRN8DWTL ★★★★★ [2023-03-05] <b>Perfect to rewire my antique lamp</b> Antique lamps and fans are often wired with cotton insulated wire. Even when they have a plastic underneath, this plastic often predates vinyl, and may crack and split. These wires become an electrical shock or fire hazard. I've been meaning to rewire an antique art deco lamp whose power cord has started to worry me. I haven't done so because the wire I had, with visible plastic insulation, would look out of place on the lamp. This wire, with a rayon covering over the round plastic insulation, will look just fine. As you can see in the photo I uploaded, the wires are copper colored, not tinned as described in the product description. Tinning is the process of coating the copper wire with solder, which would make it silver colored. Tinning reduces the oxidation or corrosion of the copper, but unless you live in a marine environment, it probably won't be a problem.",

The wire gauge size seems accurate and fits snuggly in my breadboards. Only thing I noticed is the insulation coating is a little thicker than I expected. I'm using it to do Arduino prototyping and often or run wires underneath things plugged into the breadboard and the extra thickness of the insulation tends to take up valuable space so I can't get as many wires as I used to. It's a small challenge and I may look around it other brands but overall it's a good value for the variety of colors and the fact that the wire looks like it's tinned copper. I should mention that if you're going to solder this, the insulation does look like PVC and it will melt fairly quickly, so do your soldering quickly and at lower temperatures. I use a 384° solder on a temperature adjustable weller and I haven't had an issue.

It also cuts extremely easily, meaning no scoring multiple times trying to get to the wire inside. The insulation on the wires seems like standard insulation, not the gel-type thick insulation found on other brands of speaker wire. If you do a lot of wiring, this is key as a standard wire stripper works great with it - a real time saver.

It is so nice to see black and white working together like this, and getting along with the outsider copper wire. All of the wires are \"bi\", as in \"bidirectional\". That means that the electricity will flow through them forward AND backward! You can install the wiring either way and it will still work. Isn't that awesome? Plus, it is YELLOW!!!! In my pictures you can see what I used it for. I installed butt washer on our second floor toilet. The 50' piece of YELLOW wiring was long enough to go in the hole in the wall I made, down through the wall to the basement and over to the breaker box. It's like an electron super highway!!! It was about $20 cheaper than Lowe's or Home Depot, which is awesome. Plus, it's YELLOW!!!!!!!!!!!",

This 22 AWG wire fits the bill because it is large enough to carry all the power these light strips need and is encased in a neutral white insulator. All the LED light strips I've used are either 2- or 3-wire models. (I think there are some other really fancy ones that use 4- or 5-wires but I have no experience with them.)

      "Different color insulation for each conductor|||B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ [2024-02-14] <b>Quality wire in a durable jacket</b> I acquired this cable to wire some repair some existing lights and add supplemental warning lights on my tractor. Wire for rear tractor lighting needs to be run along the underside where brush, sticks, briars claw away at it constantly. More than once, I have had wiring damaged or destroyed. I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications. I really like this wire, and I look forward to using it to upgrade my tractor warning lights in preparation for spring. It would be equally suitable for use on a mowers or trailers as well. I think this product will provide adequate protection for wiring in a tough environment for a long time. In fact, with good end connections, I am hopeful that it will last as long as the equipment.",

I was impressed by how flexible this wire is and its resistance to high temperatures. With a 200C and 600V rating, it can be used in just about any application. Unlike most stranded wire, there are way too many strands to count, which is the reason why it is so flexible. Unless using a crimp connector, the large number of very flexible strands almost dictates the end should be tinned before making a connection. The insulation was unfazed by direct application of a soldering iron when checking its tinning ability.

Not only is it flexible, but my soldering won't scorch the silicone like it will PVC jacketed wire, as silicone has a much higher tolerance for heat than PVC. I tested the resistance of each of the two strands, and both came back exactly 1.2 Ohms resistance, which means two things. #1, most importantly, the wire is not broken internally in either strand, there are no opens. #2, my volt meter is consistently lousy and at least measures off the mark twice equally. What I mean by this is that at this length, according to spec, there should be 15.88 milliohms (mΩ) of resistance in 10' of 12ga copper wire, which is far too sensitive for my cheap meter to measure. So I don't know why my meter is reading 1.2 ohms, but my guess is that is not exactly correct, and the actual resistance is functionally closer to 0 ohms.

I attached a video showing the flexibility and solder characteristics of this wire. This seems to be very high quality wire.",
      "Silicone insulation|||B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★★ [2023-10-11] <b>Great stuff! 6 coils, more than enough for multiple small projects, nice insulator. Works great!</b> I do a lot of small projects, usually LED and battery stuff, but sometimes repairs and prototyping too. This is GREAT stuff to have laying around for low-voltage work. This should carry anywhere from 14 to 22+ amps of current, depending on the temperature you are comfortable running at. While the silicone insulator may be good up to 200ºC, I'd probably stay below 90ºC (194ºF). At 600 volts, this could deliver 8.4kW up to 13.2kW of power, depending on your sensitivity for temperature! But at 12 volts, more like 168 watts. Or 48 volts, 672 watts. Fun stuff, electricity! This has been great to have around while building out USB-C PD devices to run everything in my house but small appliances off of USB-C PD 3.0 and 3.1. I built my own 4S LiPO battery pack with this stuff too! For the price, and free Prime delivery, this is great stuff.",

Althought it might be a tad smaller, but it could also be because of the finer strands vs the thick stands on the wire i was comparing it to. But it looks 18GA to me. The wire inside is copper as well, tin coated. I scraped the coating off to be sure and it is copper. Because I hate aluminum wires. Very flexible wire love the silicone coating. Should work just fine for wiring up some stiches to the relays as you dont need super thick wire for that",
      "Silicone insulation|||B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ [2023-06-19] <b>Really nice wire</b> As a DIYer and Handyman, I frequently find myself in need of various lengths of wire for projects and repairs. Since it's often useful to color code different connections, this five-color pack of 16 ga wire from Fipnot is good to have on hand. The package includes five spools of very nice quality wire with five different color insulation used. Each spool has 20 feet of wire. I really like the insulation on this wire. It's a soft silicone vs vinyl which I most often used in the past. This gives the wire great flexibility, as well as heat and abrasion resistance. The most commonly used red and black (for positive and negative DC wiring) are represented, as well as white, blue, and yellow. The wire consists of (according to the ad) 252 individual tiny strands of tinned copper wire. I didn't order this pack for any particular purpose in mind, but rather to have on hand when needed. Good to know that when the need comes up I'll have it \"in stock\" rather than having to run to a hardware store of home center!",
      "Silicone insulation|||B0CN2RB68V ★★★★★ [2023-12-24] <b>Very flexible wire, dispenser not as pictured</b> I use a lot of wire for various DIY projects and electronic repair. I really liked the dispenser shown in the product photos and video and, to be completely honest, I ordered this wire at least considering it supposedly came with the nifty dispenser box. The \"dispenser\" box has 3 holes on each side, ostensibly to allow you to pull the wire from the box. However, the box is so tight, you can barely get it to close, so, when closed, it does not allow the individual spools to move freely at all. At best, when you pull one strand, the spool next to it also moves to some extent. The wire itself appears to be fantastic - very supple and super flexible. The silicone insulation is on the thick side, so any sharp bends or small nicks probably won't have a big impact on the stranded wire within. The also include some matching zip-ties and (what I am assuming is) heat-shrink tubing. Since the review is for the wire itself, I won't take any stars for the disappointing \"dispenser\" box because the wire is actually really nice.",
      "Silicone jacket|||B0CRYX1P5T ★★★★★ [2024-03-03] <b>Incredibly flexible, good wire for projects</b> What struck me immediately was how flexible this wire is, it's so flexible and easy to manipulate. The silicon sheath has a good texture and strips off cleanly, this is a very useful wire for custom project as long as the length and gauge fit your needs. It seems strong, and soldered on very neatly. The two wires are separate, so if you want a braided setup, you'll have to do that yourself. I appreciate the quality and flexibility for almost anything you need, even if this is a bit pricier than most wires.",
      "Silicone insulated wire|||B0D2NZY48M ★★★★☆ [2024-04-02] <b>Nice assortment of wire for electronics bench work; don't go by current rating provided, though</b> I'm a hobbyist maker who creates and repairs electronics, including microcontroller and IoT projects. Having an assortment of wire on hand helps ensure I'm using the right wire for the job both in function and appearance (color coding). This assortment includes 8 spools of silicone insulated 18AWG wire in different colors, along with heatshrink tubing and wire ties in matching colors which is a nice touch for neater, more professional looking wiring jobs. The spools are included in a box with holes to allow for dispensing, but the spools lay flat in the box -- not on edge like other boxes of dispensable wire I have. This isn't really an issue, just an odd choice and it makes the box a bit wider and flatter compared to a vertical orientation. Also included is a very basic wire stripper, though I don't use it as I have more capable wire strippers at hand. I would tend to challenge the specs/rating sheet included. Generally I wouldn't suggest anywhere near 22A be run through 18AWG wire. More like half that, tops. While the silicone insultation will help reduce the chance of fire from an over current situation compared to PVC or other materials, it will still get very hot and is a grossly inefficient application of power, with so much energy being lost as heat due to the resistance of the wire. Further, seeing the recommendation here could lead the inexperienced to conclude that's a safe current for any similarly sized wire. Otherwise, I'm quite satisfied with this product.",

      "Silicone insulation|||B0758CBY6R ★★★★★ [2024-02-18] <b>Extremely flexible</b> I love this wire. This wire is extremely easy to solder which makes that go many times faster. Mostly the thing I like the most is how flexible the wire is. Describing how flexible I would have to say it’s as flexible as a cooked spaghetti noodle. The extreme flexibility takes all the stress off of my 12v switches. All of the other wires were so stiff they pulled on the switches due to how the wires hung or which way the wire was going. This caused the switches to sometimes not stay in place on the panel or the wires could work themselves loose or could pull off at times. I typically am using 12 and 14 gauge wires due to the high watts of many of the led lights I use and even the 12 gauge silicone wires are as flexible as a cooked spaghetti noodle. Now you can’t get this wire to twist together when attaching two of them due to the extra fine wires in it but that’s where the extremely easy soldering really comes in handy. I solder the ends and then use heat shrink tubes and end up with a much cleaner job.",

This wire (#22) has insulation that is slightly thicker than some PVC insulations but not a lot thicker. Its easy to strip the insulation but its not so soft that it tears or can be crushed off the wire easily - I've had silicone insulation that was just to fragile and this is perfect - The slightly tougher insulation is slightly stiffer but its a much better compromise for applications where the wiring won't be completely protected in a sleeve - even inside an enclosure, some of them are too easily damaged and this holds up well. Colors are very solid/bright - no issues there The conductor is very finely stranded and individually tinned strands - very nice construction and easy to work with.

      "Soft silicone|||B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ [2024-02-09] <b>Excellent</b> This is an excellent wire from what I can tell so far. The advantage to the silicone insulation is that the wire is more flexible than wire with pvc or other plastic insulation. When tinned or soldered, the silicone doesn't shrivel and melt back like. This wire seemed to require a hotter temp to get solder to flow, but once it reached that point the wire tinned fine. The other advantage to silicone is that it doesn't actually melt, so it can handle high temperatures better. The down side is that silicone is more expensive, but for many applications it may be well worth the added expense. This wire will suit my needs perfectly, I'm very happy with this product.",

I twisted the strands and crimped 16 ga. connectors. The twisted wires fit the connectors and crimped properly. I could not pull the connection apart. It would have been nice to have had a hole in the spool to keep the wire from de-reeling, but an 11/64 drill bit took care of that.

The actual wire itself appears to be of some good quality and is tinned copper. Which will be nice for soldering. A couple of the colors are a little off from what you would normally expect, but they are still close enough and easy to tell apart. The box has holes for easy dispensing of the wire and to keep it from unrolling everywhere. In the kit you also get a good assortment of colored heat shrink tubing and small zip ties so you can color match and make everything look all spiffy. The little wire stripper it comes with is actually pretty good and strips quite well. I like it because it is a great size to put in a compact tool kit like for a motorcycle, boat, car, or whatever you want. If you are like me and do a lot of DIY projects then this kit is a great thing to have on hand. I actually plan to get the 10AWG kit also for higher current projects.

      "Silicone rubber insulation|||B01K4RPB3O ★★★★★ [2023-02-16] <b>Good quality, high strand-count high flexibility tinned wire with silicone rubber insulation</b> This 22 AWG (gauge) silicone insulated wire is excellent for indoor or protected environments where high flexibility/lack of stiffness, and non-melting (or at least melt resistant) insulation is required. The conductors are a 'high strand count\" type, meaning that instead of being comprised of just a few larger/thicker strands, it is instead comprised of a much greater number of smaller/thinner strands; and this contributes to its lack of stiffness/great flexibility. The other contributing factor to the high flexibility is that the insulation is silicone rubber, rather than the more common PVC (which is rather stiff). This kind of high strand count, silicone rubber insulated wire is exactly what high quality test equipment 'test leads' have been made of for decades. The silicone rubber is also much less heat sensitive than more common insulations such as PVC or \"machine tool wire\". It won't melt off as readily as PVC insulation does if your soldering iron needs to be held onto a joint or terminal for an extended period of time. The fine wire strands are also nicely tinned, and the insulation strips off easily and cleanly, and the stranded wire solders easily. It is a good quality product at an affordable price. HOWEVER, it is not the best choice for many common \"hook up wire\" applications, since its lack of stiffness can be an issue; the strands definitely need to be twisted and soldered in order to keep their shape enough to be formed into a hook before soldering around a terminal for example. This wire also does not want to cooperate if you want to twist a few of them together, because their limpness makes them uncooperative in that regard. And if you use this wire in \"hook up wire\" applications, it wants to just flop into some odd position rather than 'staying put' where you want it to be. Silicone rubber insulation is also not that great when it comes to abrasion resistance, and resistance to some kinds of oils and such where other insulations may be preferable.",

      "Silicone insulation|||B0BTHHGLFY ★★★★★ [2024-04-18] <b>Looks really good. Real tinned copper. Very slinky</b> There's not a whole lot to say about this wire that hasn't been said in other reviews already. I ordered the 12 awg with 10 feet of each red and black. I was just trying to round out my stock a bit as I already had some 10, 14 and 16 awg silicone wire around. I tend to order BNTechGo as I tried them once and was plenty happy with it. This stuff seems just as good as far as I can tell. My main concern was if it was real tinned copper or not so I stripped a section and scraped it with a sharp knife until I could clearly see the copper start showing through the tin. So yes, this is definitely real copper. The strands are extremely fine, which is great for flexibility but can make it tough to strip without cutting some. But that's the case with all flexible silicone wire, so no real issue there compared to other brands. These 10' sections came in just loose coils in a resealable pouch, which I guess is fine given how short they are; normally I prefer spools.

      "Silicone insulation|||B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ [2024-03-10] <b>Good variety kit, high quality wire</b> I ordered this wire to use with DIY electronics projects as well as wiring accessory devices in my electric bike. The main reason why I chose this wire over cheaper wire variety packs is because this wire has silicone insulation which is more durable, flexible, and heat resistant than conventional wire insulation. The silicone insulation did not disappoint. You can see in the video I attached that the insulation is quite resistant to heat and does not melt as easily. Notice the reaction of the bare wire to heat in the video as well. The wire is indeed tinned and when you heat it, the tinning material evaporates and the bare copper wire is left underneath. This is something you should take into consideration when connecting these wires to a terminal since the tinning should be removed in order to get a solid connection. Probably a regular lighter is more suited to this task than a blow torch. Overall I am very satisfied with this wire kit. The wire is all very high quality and perfect for automotive applications due to the heat and wear resistance of the silicone insulation. This kit also comes with a wire stripper, some zip ties, and heat shrink. I could care less about these extras but it might be a nice perk if you don't have these items already. I would highly recommend this kit if you need a variety of different colored wires for an automotive project. The silicone insulation is the best you can get.",

      "Silicone insulated|||B0BYNNJS8B ★★★★★ [2023-11-04] <b>Good Quality, High Temp Wire</b> I work on a lot of electronics requiring 12-gauge wire and recently procured this wire for a couple of my projects. I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful.",

We would have loved to have this in the past few months as we had to buy wire separately (and wire is expensive!) The reason why I am giving this three stars is that value-wise, all the non-wire parts of this isn't really worth the upcharge considering the small length of wire you are getting. I did a basic comparison, and another seller is doing six colors, 100 feet each of 18 gauge and that was $27. This would make a good beginner gift but the little extras like the strippers, the dispensing box, the ties....those are all very ehhhh. You know, expected low quality. I realize wire is expensive, but less than 200 feet total of wire versus 600 feet, even if two extra colors and some extra fiddly stuff for application, and paying $7ish extra for the privilege?

I tested the wire's resistance and per the American Wire Gauge (AWG) Table, I should get 6.4 ohms resistance per 1000 feet of 18 gauge wire. I don't have a multimeter sensitive enough to measure just 23 feet of wire as in this kit, but my multimeter was bouncing between .1 and .2 ohms. Right in the ballpark of .14 ohms for 23 feet that I calculate I should have. Sorry I didn't have enough hands to measure the wire and get a picture too. I also held the wire over a flame for several seconds. The insulation stood up just fine without and visible damage to the wire. The wire itself is very flexible and I like the silicone insulation. I didn't think too much of the little wire stripper/cutter included in the kit. But, it will work if you don't already have proper tools. The little zip ties are handy, but so few won't last too long! One more thing is I thought the kit is a little spendy for what you get. But, if you need several colors of wire, but not much of it, this may work for you. Better than buying several larger rolls that you don't end up using most of. Overall, a solid product that I can recommend, given the above comments. In my book, a solid 4 star product, very useful and a quality product. But, nothing too special.

Someone said it was aluminum core, but that is not true. It is TINNED COPPER which gives the color of aluminum unless you look at the cut end of the wire. Then, you can see it is definitely copper core. You could also measure its resistance. It measures 0.031 ohms resistance in 30’. That’s equivalent to 1.033 ohms per 1000’. The standard for resistance of 10-gauge copper wire is 1.018 ohms per 100’ @ 25° C. Aluminum wire (10-gauge) is 1.649 ohms @ 25° C. My reading was at 24° C. Therefore, it’s copper wire. This wire is extremely flexible because of its silicone insulation and the extremely fine wire strands that make up the wire core. That makes it easy to work with and very desirable.

The silicone was a bit thicker than I was hoping for, but it worked out for me. This seems like nice wire. The insulation stripped cleanly with just two light cuts on opposing sides and a tug. It's nice a flexible. It soldered very well. I recommend it. My only noteable potential negative is insulation was a bit thick for 30AWG, in terms of fitting within small projects.

      "Black flexible rubber insulation|||B0CSD3GJ53 ★★★★☆ [2024-03-08] <b>ETL listed, just like regular zip wire but 12 gauge</b> With spring headed our way, we're beginning to plan for some landscaping improvements in our yard, and low-voltage lighting is one of the things I'd like to add, so I picked up this wire. This wire looks like your typical lamp cord/zip wire, but at 12 gauge, this is pretty stout wire. Like zip wire, the two conductors are insulated in black flexible rubber insulation and joined by a thin section of rubber in the middle, so you can easily split the two conductors apart for making any necessary connections. And like typical zip wire, one of the conductors is identified by ribbing on the exterior of the insulation; this conductor is used, by convention, as the neutral wire. I've learned the hard way that before you put any wire into service, check it for breaks. Both conductors in this 100 foot spool passed the continuity test. What else is there to like? They include a chart (see photo) that shows the maximum wattage for any given length and gauge of wire, so it's nice to have that as a handy reference. It's also ETL listed (sort of like UL listed). For low voltage applications like landscape lighting, you could argue that being ETL listed is overkill, but it's a nice thing to have regardless since it is rated for up to 300 volts. One minor nit--I wish that they had length markings on the wire like some wires do--once you start using this, it's nice to be able to know how much length is remaining without having to unspool it and find it's not enough. Again, maybe overkill for a 100' spool but that would have been a really nice touch.",

The wire is very flexible and appears to be sized correctly. The conductors are tinned copper (not copper coated aluminum) as described and there are a large number of individual conductors - helping considerably to make the wire as flexible as it is. The insulation appears and feels to be silicone (also as described). The colors are also vibrant as in the description. One nice feature is that each spool of wire is individually labelled - so once these leave their original box and I pick up a spool in 6 months I won't be wondering whether the wire is 14, 16 or 18 AWG - the spool is clearly labeled 16AWG. Overall I don't see anything at all wrong with this wire and give it five stars.",

I'm restoring an older classic '67 GTO and making a few changes on a custom bike I built long ago. This set of '6' various color spools arrived in good time and in its own 'stronger' cardboard 'reusable' box. Upon giving a bit of this stuff a 'go test' on re-wiriing new horns on that ol' relic and the same for a new honker on the bike - this stuff worked out better than the stuff I'm used to from a few spools lying around here. U can tell the immediate difference in the flexibility of the sheathing. Like comparing thick racing engine plug wire to the cheap thin stuff. As for any soldering - stuffs great thou higher bond point u can tell its stronger. Any splices r handled with some new solder joint connectors I just happened to snatch up and this stuff worked great in those too. I did find that there is the slight possiblity of tearing open the silicone jacket of this stuff 'easier' over other types due to having easier stripping ability so yankin' on this stuff when routing any wire runs needs to b given some added care to avoid snags on anything sharp. Otherwise some great wire here and worth the lil xtra bidenbux for an overall better quality product.",

I only wish I could get it in larger spools because it always seems like a 25' spool is just long enough for one project but leaves me with drops that aren't quite long enough for the next project. Still, I would recommend this wire. The silicone insulation is smooth and supple, bends easily and doesn't become hard to handle like the cheapo PVC insulated wire. Also, the tinned copper makes soldering a breeze. You can find cheaper wire, but you'll get what you pay for. If you want quality, pre-tinned wire with silicone insulation then you've set a standard that cheap wire can't achieve. This is the wire you're looking for.

There is a roll of red, black, yellow, blue, and green. The insulation is rubbery and stripped off easily for me. This set comes with a nice little cardboard box. There are small holes on both sides where you can feed the wires through to act as dispensers. One side is under the lid, so the wire ends are held under the lid when not in use. The other side is opposite so you can keep the lid closed and be able to pull wire out. It also comes with a small pack of heat shrink tubing in the same colors as the wires.

The 18 gauge is good for smaller, low current circuits. I really like that the box itself is a dispenser, that way I won't have to worry about keeping track of all the spools and worrying about them unwinding themselves while being moved around in a drawer or something. The wire itself is aluminum, so not the highest quality, but it only needs to carry a little power, I wouldn't use this for signal wire that can't tolerate noise (speakers, sensitive control circuits, etc.). The insulation is rubberized and very flexible. It makes it a little more difficult to strip, but will protect it better from sharp edges so it's worth it. The included color matched shrink tubing and zip ties are a good touch too.",

It is definitely a silver color wire and I see no copper at all. Super small strands of wires so it should work well in a project that requires repetitive motion.

It is tinned copper, as evident by two facts: the ends of the strands are red when cut, and it takes solder very easily. This is exactly what you want, as fine stranded bare copper would corrode too easily. The jacket is definitely a good quality high temp silicone, and is on the thicker side for silicone wire. I prefer this, as silicone jackets generally tear easily if they are too thin. The wire gauge is at least true to size. I haven't stripped and weighed it, but it fits snugly in my 10AWG crimp terminals. The only way this could possibly be made better is if the wire was made from 7 bunches of twisted strands, with the combined cable twisted the other direction. This improves flexibility and keeps strands together after stripping.",

I've been using very similar wire, and will be using this wire, for primary power on my larger RC planes. The tinning and fine stranding make it easy to solder into various connectors and the flexibility allows this relatively large conductor to be easily tucked away inside my models. The high temperature rating of the insulation ensures that it can handle the heavy, usually short-term amperages that today's advanced RC battery and motor technology demand. I also like to use this wire for various other hobby projects where flexibility is required for making or breaking plug-in connections. It can withstand a lot of flexing due to both the fine stranding and the thick. but soft. silicone insulation. The wire is marked at regular intervals with conductor size and insulation temperature ratings. It is not listed, nor is it appropriate for building wiring.

Be sure you know what you're buying. This is ultra flexible, with many super-fine strands and silicone rubber insulation marked 200C (higher than PVC but lower than PTFE). The fine strands (150 of them, but I didn't count!) can be a bit of a challenge when crimping contacts... make sure no microscopic strands escape the crimp -- then it works great. The insulation is thick but soft: very easy to work with but also easily damaged if used in the wrong application. It's the right cable for routing in tight locations, since it's so willing to bend and lay flat... good for DIY drones (flexing arms or retracting legs) or making wiring harnesses that need to flex but are well protected from abrasion and pinching. For more rugged high-temp insulation, consider PTFE but it is much more difficult to work with and hard to find at a reasonable price. As noted by others, some colors are a bit off. Red is clearly orange, and blue is gray-purple. That's okay for my purposes, but maybe not if you are building to a print for assemblies that will be inspected. The velcro wraps keep each spool neat, and the box is good for organizing these spools when lots of other wire spools are around.",

(Probably mostly good.) What's bad is that it was too thick to work with my standard wire stripping took, so I needed to remove the outer insulation by hand, using a razor blade. The thickness of the insulation, and the fact that it's not a uniform thickness all around (see photo), made it hard to cut off the outer insulation without nicking the inner insulation on the individual conductors. The GOOD aspect is that the extra-thick outer insulation will likely protect the conductors from being crushed or otherwise damaged during use.

I used it to run my low voltage LED power supply to junction boxes that then go to the individual lights or light strings. Due to the heavy insulation jacket it is ideal for the primary run, and not for a string of connections, since the jacket not only protects the wires, but also makes it more difficult to connect than standard parallel low voltage wiring with a single layer of insulation over each wire.

The outer sheath is a nice thickness and molded tight to the four conductors , which will help prevent moisture intrusion. The insulation on the individual wires is on the thinner side but is quite tough. The outer sheath toughens the whole bundle further. The combination, along with the 27 tinned copper filaments in each wire, allows the wire to be fairly flexible. The PVC insulation on both the individual wires and the outer sheath work well to provide what feels like a nice tough but pliable package. The included shrink sleeves are not dual wall (w/adhesive inner surface), so I won't be using them - I always use dual wall adhesive lined heat shrink on my outdoor, marine, and RV projects.

My only issue with this design is, with the wire inside the box, you can't see how much you have left. With some colours, 16ft goes quickly. I absolutely enjoy the colour matching zip ties and heat shrink. I hate putting black heat shrink on coloured wire. Drives me crazy. When I first opened the box, I laughed at the wire stripper. I was going to bash it, but honestly, it's not bad. Works better and safer than me pushing wire between my thumb and pocket knife blade. The wire I show in the picture was stripped using the wire strippers provided. There are four different sized slots on the strippers for four different sized wires, but they aren't labelled, so be sure to double check before cutting in.

No problem using it anywhere from 12 volt to 72 volts as long as amperage is kept within the recommended limits. One small note, unless you are really good with a sharp knife the thick outer covering is best cut and removed with a special tool. Just use a search term like \"round cable stripper\" and you'll find a variety of appropriate tools. Find a tool that matches the diameter(s) of the various multi-core cables you intend to be using. Over time I have actually ordered two styles of cable strippers, one for small diameters and another for diameters all the way up to an inch or more. The strippers add to you immediate cost but they will save a LOT of frustration caused by nicking the inner insulation and having to start over.

This is perfect for use in almost any decent kind of connectors and it is flexible enough to be durable and nice to work with. - Insulation on the individual strands is of very good quality and they are powdered so the outer insulation can be easily removed. - The wire is real copper, with tin plating and the tin plating is of very good quality. This resists corrosion and will carry electricity very well. - Packaging was very good and there are 3 twist ties around the roll of wire, holding it together and keeping it neat. Twist ties are very good because they are much easier to deal with than zip ties and they are reusable. Cons: - Outer insulation is PVC, which will likely become much stiffer in cold weather, but it appears to be good quality PVC, so maybe it won't be too bad. I can't tell right now because the weather here is not cold enough now. - Clearly labeled \"Made in China\". Overall: Excellent quality product.",

      "Slightly thinner insulation compared to original wire|||B0CSD3GJ53 ★★★★★ [2024-03-23] <b>Great wire, but not compatible with some crimp connectors</b> I installed our landscape lighting almost 2 decades ago. Some bulbs have gone out due to failing electrical connectors. I tried replacing the connectors, but the insulation on the existing wire has become so hard that the prongs on the connectors just don’t penetrate correctly anymore. I ordered this to replace that hardened landscape wire. Unfortunately, the Quic Disc connectors I used previously do not work with this wire. Its insulation is slightly thinner than the original wire, and the conductors are spaced closer together. The Quic Disc prongs don’t align properly with the new conductors. If one prong hits the center of one conductor, the other prong can miss the other conductor entirely. The lights are only a few feet apart in a long flower bed, and I didn’t want to cut this wire into many short segments to use wire nuts at each light. So I tried the new Malibu Low Voltage Cable Connectors that pierce the insulation from both sides. They work perfectly, and have the advantage that the wire doesn’t have to be split apart every few feet to use an alternate piercing connector. Bottom line, this is great wire, with real copper conductors and flexible insulation that is easy to work with. It just isn't compatible with crimp connectors that expect the conductors to have the same spacing as in old 12 gauge landscape wire.",

The stranding measures a little over 1mm diameter, so 16 gauge is also accurate. The wiring jacket says AWM on it, so this would be suitable for appliances needing a new plug (this is not SJOOW and shouldn't be used for extension cables). When I stripped the jacket back there was a weird white powder substance (I presume from manufacturing). I bought this to extend the cable length on a portable LED flood light and had no issues soldering this wire. I am unsure why the listing title says low voltage, given there is a ground wire, but I can only presume it's because it uses a red/black color for live and neutral opposed to the industry standard blue/white coloring.

      "Double insulated|||B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ [2024-01-31] <b>Works great for farm use</b> The RiteFENCE Electric Fence Double Insulated Underground Hard Cable is working perfectly for use 'underneath' my 12' and 16' foot double gates that lead to my pasture. For years I have used a system where I disconnect my electric fence by hand to open my gates without getting shocked. I dug a small trench about 6\" deep under a couple of my gates and buried the RiteFENCE, and left each end protrude out of the ground about two feet to connect to one of the lower existing fence wires so as not to disconnect the continuous circuit at any time when opening gates now. I chose the 6\" depth to bury the heavily insulated RiteFENCE since in addition to moving livestock through the gates, I also drive vehicles and farm implements through the gates as well. The RiteFENCE is very sturdy and rigid, and the 12-½ gauge took some time to straighten out to fit flat and neatly into the trenches I dug and placed the wire into, but this is a definite plus for electric fence wire to be used on a farm or ranch. The RiteFENCE doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and has a thick outer coating with the inner wire apparently coated as well for the 'double insulation' aspect. When installing, I also cut back a couple of inches of the RiteFENCE on each end and used a heavy duty crimp connection to the barb wire fencing I use. Once crimped, I neatly wrapped the connections with quality electrical tape to seal from the elements. The RiteFENCE is going to be ideal for many other underground connection needs I have around the farm. I would highly recommend any farmers and ranchers who run electric fence to give the RiteFENCE a try if you want to eliminate the risk of a nasty shock, especially with the higher powered fence chargers. The price point seems very fair and in fact is actually a little cheaper than what I saw at my local farm supply store. Highly recommend!",

Luckily, a variety of providers have arisen over the past few years. Here we have one where most of the work has been done for you, with the AC plug already connected. Now there's no question that this is a contemporary AC plug, and if you're doing a genuine restoration, you probably won't go this route, but there's also no question that this is a safe approach and one that is probably going to be hidden by furniture anyway.

There is no inner layer of white insulation; there is only the one layer of black coating on the wire. The single insulation was adequate for the job I had to do, but I will not be ordering any additional supplies from this company. As a farmer in a rural area, I must be able to rely on having the products that arrive at my door be what I ordered. I don't have time to send things back or argue with suppliers. I had never ordered anything from RiteFence before, but I decided to try out this wire for a specific project. Now I know that I can't trust their products to be what they say. Next time I'll stick with double insulated wire from Kencove."

This is a little on the stiff side but that is because it is quality wire and safe in all regards. It consists of two stranded copper wires, each housed in their own plastic casing and then both wires housed inside of another plastic casing, with the cloth on the outside.

      "Thick insulation|||B07JMVX22G ★★★☆☆ [2023-12-09] <b>The wire is good.</b> The wire is good, not brittle, conductivity is't at any point interrupted and the wire is perfectly usable for projects which are suitable for thin wire (low current and low voltage projects). The insulation could have been a little thinner and sometimes makes the wire a little difficult to work with in tight spots where many wires need to be connected to a small connection point and so on. That said it's unlikely to short, the insulation is unlikely to perish to the point where it's not insulating. It's also true that the whole roll is a single length of wire, so it would be suitable for a low current and fairly long distance connection too. It's a good thing to have but primarily useful for connections to a power source.",

      "Single outer mantle with 2 wires inside|||B0C9D4VCK7 ★★★★☆ [2023-08-10] <b>Not perfect for landscape lighting</b> I am working on some landscape lighting in the yard, and ran a thick 12G wire around the yard to provide power everywhere. This 18G wire is great to splice into the 12G, and provide power to small groups of lights that are placed a bit further away from the big cable. When I opened the package, I noticed one thing I did not consider: This wire has a single outer mantle, and 2 wires inside it (instead of having 2 wires externally). This makes it harder to use the snap-in connectors, since you have to cut the mantle to expose the inner wires. Therefore, since this is advertised for 'landscape lighting', I cannot give it a full 5 stars. 4 stars will have to do.",

This wire is insane thick. Non usable for all my applications, takes too much space. Can't use it in tight packed fixtures where size 22 was a perfect fit so far. Forget soldering it to smaller connectors with a few pins. Since I did not use it, I can't comment on other wire qualities. I assume extra thickness may be a plus where it is desired. Not for me. Also, entire wire seems very soft, almost like stranded wire. My old hookup wire was solid and much harder, stiffer. I liked it because wire stayed in exact desired position after I bent, adjusted it to space in my fixtures. 3 stars only because extra thickness is not mentioned in description, and it is still called HOOK UP WIRE which to me is not true.",

They certainly paid attention to the presentation. It has a shiny outer jacket, it comes with two velcro straps to keep it neatly coiled, it also has a baggie full of heat-shrink tubing and tie wraps. They even took the time to strip off about 2 inches of the outer jacket on either end of the cable and then stripped the ends of each individual wire. So good job to them for recognizing that presentation matters. The outer jacket is just a sleeve, it's not bonded to the wire like many others. I doubt that this is burial grade and the listing doesn't say that it is. The listing shows 12 volts, but if you strip back enough of the outer jacket, you can see that the wire itself has 600V and 105 degrees Celsius printed on it.

      "individual wire insulation|||B0CMZD1G64 ★★★★★ [2023-12-27] <b>Outer insulation is THICK!</b> I tried this for an outside, low-voltage lighting application, with the wire buried. It seems to be working well, but I'll need to come back in a year or so, to see how it's holing up. One thing I did notice is that the outer insulation is VERY thick. I suppose this is good and bad. (Probably mostly good.) What's bad is that it was too thick to work with my standard wire stripping took, so I needed to remove the outer insulation by hand, using a razor blade. The thickness of the insulation, and the fact that it's not a uniform thickness all around (see photo), made it hard to cut off the outer insulation without nicking the inner insulation on the individual conductors. The GOOD aspect is that the extra-thick outer insulation will likely protect the conductors from being crushed or otherwise damaged during use. (An extra-thick outer layer of insulation could come in especially handy for outdoor buried applications, to protect against a spade or small shovel , for example, when planting flowers.) So far, I am pleased with this product!",

I was able to make a quick slit with utility blade grab the wires and tear down the sleeve to the spot I wanted the sleeve removed. I used this to wire up new DC dimmable led lamps in my warehouse.

      "Tight insulation on individual wires|||B0CGQ29J9Q ★★★★★ [2023-03-11] <b>Perfect for outdoor speaker wire.</b> I like listening to music when I’m outside working in the yard. I move a column speaker outside and connect it to a small PA amp. The flexible KWANGIL 16 AWG wire makes this process much easier than the stiffer 18 AWG speaker wire that I had previously been using. As an added bonus, this wire is UV stable and also tinned to protect it from corrosion. And the tinned wire is super easy to solder. KWANGIL even supplies the coil with an end cap on each wire end to keep the wire in perfect condition until it’s ready to be used. The 20 feet of wire is supplied wound in a ~7 ½ inch coil and packaged in a sealed plastic bag. Thanks to the large size of the coil, when the wire is unwrapped it lays fairly flat unlike wire that has been tightly coiled. Stripping the outer jacket was just as easy as the listing said it would be. I stripped 4 inches from one end with no problem. Stripping the individual wires on the other hand isn’t as easy. The insulation on each wire is tight but that also keeps moisture away. Stripping ½ inch took a bit of work, stripping 1 inch I found easiest to do in two ½ inch pieces.

      "Inner wire coated|||B0BRS56YR9 ★★★★★ [2024-01-31] <b>Works great for farm use</b> The RiteFENCE Electric Fence Double Insulated Underground Hard Cable is working perfectly for use 'underneath' my 12' and 16' foot double gates that lead to my pasture. For years I have used a system where I disconnect my electric fence by hand to open my gates without getting shocked. I dug a small trench about 6\" deep under a couple of my gates and buried the RiteFENCE, and left each end protrude out of the ground about two feet to connect to one of the lower existing fence wires so as not to disconnect the continuous circuit at any time when opening gates now. I chose the 6\" depth to bury the heavily insulated RiteFENCE since in addition to moving livestock through the gates, I also drive vehicles and farm implements through the gates as well. The RiteFENCE is very sturdy and rigid, and the 12-½ gauge took some time to straighten out to fit flat and neatly into the trenches I dug and placed the wire into, but this is a definite plus for electric fence wire to be used on a farm or ranch. The RiteFENCE doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and has a thick outer coating with the inner wire apparently coated as well for the 'double insulation' aspect. When installing, I also cut back a couple of inches of the RiteFENCE on each end and used a heavy duty crimp connection to the barb wire fencing I use. Once crimped, I neatly wrapped the connections with quality electrical tape to seal from the elements. The RiteFENCE is going to be ideal for many other underground connection needs I have around the farm. I would highly recommend any farmers and ranchers who run electric fence to give the RiteFENCE a try if you want to eliminate the risk of a nasty shock, especially with the higher powered fence chargers. The price point seems very fair and in fact is actually a little cheaper than what I saw at my local farm supply store. Highly recommend!",
      "Plastic sheathing encapsulates individually insulated conductors|||B0CBMZGNFL ★★★☆☆ [2023-10-02] <b>Outer sheathing seems a bit thin</b> The 16 AWG two conductor wire is stranded copper. The strands are individually tinned and solders very easily. The plastic sheathing totally incapsulates the individually insulated conductors. I also purchased some 18 AWG 2 conductor wire made by a different manufacturer. The outer diameters of this 16 AWG is smaller then the 18 AWG wire, meaning that the heavier gauge (16 AWG) wire has a thinner outer insulation sheath to protect the inner conductors. In the attached photo you can see the 18 gauge cable on the left and the 16 gauge wire on the right. I am disappointed with how thin this cable is and am concerned with it's durability.

I'm Happy!</b> I started working on my project this afternoon, using this wire! This is copper wire, NOT CCA wire (copper coated aluminum). Each lead, red and black have a substantial insulating cover. In addition, both leads/wires are surrounded by another insulation layer that binds everything together. The finished product is round and smooth. This is designed as a direct burial wire. That means it can be used outside, including in the dirt just as it is. However, remember to make all connections perfectly watertight. Part of my project will have the wire exposed to direct sunlight. So I feel certain it will hold up for a long time. Today I made connections using this wire by soldering as well as crimping connectors. I was super pleased with how it performed. Thanks for reading my review!

This is a standard Romex style wire with vinyl outer sleeve and insulated individual wires, (white, black, and uninsulated ground.) I do wonder why we do not insulate our ground wires, but that is the standard here and I haven't seen any issues to date with that. Honestly, ground and neutral seem to be ok on the same ground blocks unless you feed into a sub panel where neutral and ground have to be on separate bus bars. Moving on from the lesson, I can say this is a good 12/2 romex that I can recommend that is also decently priced. Locally 15ft of 12/2 romex costs 28 dollars and 40 dollars for 25ft just to give some context on how good this is as a deal.",

What a deal... just perfect to both use and store, sits flat and doesn't take up much room and stacks well. Great start... The outside insulation jacket is a very thick PVC material, it wasn't real easy to cut so it shouldn't nick easily (think of a errant nick from using a wire staple). Even though it's a thick jacket, it's super pliable. The inside wire insulation both cuts and strips more easily than the outside and is easy to work with. I only hesitate saying a joy, because it sounds to corny... There's about a million different uses and projects that this wire would be perfect for, you'll certainly run out of wire before you run out of projects. It is NOT house wiring or electrical supply to anything... it's very small, 22 gauge is tiny.. In a house, it would be doorbell or maybe 'ring' style wiring (or alarm sensors), garage door buttons & sensors, not for lights or outlets, extension cords, etc.. Most people probably realize that - but I'm saying it here, just in case... Save yourself a trip to the local hardware and just keep a roll of this on hand.

      "Thin inner sheathing around individual wire strands|||B0C9D4VCK7 ★★★★★ [2023-09-09] <b>Nice wire, quality outer sheathing</b> This bundle of wiring is dual-wire 18 AWG stranded tinned-copper wiring. The outer sheathing is really durable and flexible (as you can see in the picture). The inner sheathing around each individual wire strand is on the thinner side I thought. If you strip away the outer sheathing, I would definitely recommend using heat shrink or electrical tape to add a layer of protection to the inner sheathing. I wanted to see how this wire would do when it is cold, so I put the bundle in the freezer for an hour. It was obviously much stiffer when it was frozen, and it tended to hold its shape when bent; however even when it was frozen, the outer sheathing still allowed it to bend just as tightly as I showed in the one picture. The sheathing did not crack or discolor when it was frozen and bent this tightly. So I think that this wire will work well, even in cold-environment applications. Overall great bundle of wire, I plan to use it in an automotive application.",
      "Soft inner jacketing of individual leads|||B08C9WNSWN ★★★★☆ [2021-04-17] <b>Perfect solution for low-amperage DC feed-</b> I bought this to create power cables for low-current draw video devices. It is flexible and plenty resilient. The individual multi-strand leads are nice and solder well but the jacketing of the leads tends to draw up if you go higher than say 750 degrees and more than a couple seconds contact time. You should know that the inner jacketing of the individual leads is somewhat soft as well which helps with flexibility however can easily be nicked or accidentally stripped away during stripping of the outer jack for readying for connector assembly so cut your lengths a touch long in case you have to re-strip. The overall outer jacket diameter is also slightly smaller than the spec's show so if you are ordering connectors with specific strain-reliefs, think at the smaller end of available strain reliefs. I think it actually measured at .25mm smaller than showed on the spec sheet.",
      "Tight insulation on individual wires|||B0CGQ29J9Q ★★★★★ [2023-03-11] <b>Perfect for outdoor speaker wire.</b> I like listening to music when I’m outside working in the yard. I move a column speaker outside and connect it to a small PA amp. The flexible KWANGIL 16 AWG wire makes this process much easier than the stiffer 18 AWG speaker wire that I had previously been using. As an added bonus, this wire is UV stable and also tinned to protect it from corrosion. And the tinned wire is super easy to solder. KWANGIL even supplies the coil with an end cap on each wire end to keep the wire in perfect condition until it’s ready to be used. The 20 feet of wire is supplied wound in a ~7 ½ inch coil and packaged in a sealed plastic bag. Thanks to the large size of the coil, when the wire is unwrapped it lays fairly flat unlike wire that has been tightly coiled. Stripping the outer jacket was just as easy as the listing said it would be. I stripped 4 inches from one end with no problem. Stripping the individual wires on the other hand isn’t as easy. The insulation on each wire is tight but that also keeps moisture away. Stripping ½ inch took a bit of work, stripping 1 inch I found easiest to do in two ½ inch pieces. The wire works great with the speaker and is easy to coil when I’m ready to put the speaker away.",

These connectors were already in use and they seemed like a good replacement for when I ran new wiring. They seem like they would protect well against moisture. However, it seems if you pre-strip the wires they do not give a very good connection. I had to cut off a couple of the new ones I installed and reapply because of flaky connections (they cannot be res-used). It's a good job they come in a bag of 50! They are not that easy to use either since the sleeves to hold the wires in place are quite short.",

The outer sheath is a nice thickness and molded tight to the three conductors , which will help prevent moisture intrusion. The insulation on the individual wires is on the thinner side, but again, the outer sheath toughens the whole bundle. The combination, along with the 27 tinned copper filaments in each wire, allows the wire to be fairly flexible. The included shrink sleeves are not dual wall (w/adhesive inner surface), so I won't be using them for my project, but they are not the main reason for getting this wire. The wire itself is nicely made and we are happy with it."

      "Flimsy and easily tearable shielding|||B000BPG1ZC ★★★★☆ [2023-07-26] <b>It's wire. Not like the old wire.</b> I am not a pro, just a do-it-yourselfer. I didn't have to pull this through conduit so I can't vouch for that. I will say the shielding is flimsy, it tears fairly easily. It does not hug the wires, the wires rattle around inside the shielding. The shielding is very easily cut and removed. I assume all this makes it easier to work with for pros, but for a layman you have to be cautious not to rip through to the conductors. I was attaching this to 1979 wiring, and it's pretty shocking how much smaller the new wire is. Both old and new were 12-2 gauge, but the original copper is about twice as big around. How does that work?"

For me, that's a great selling point and one of the reasons that I ordered this coil of wire. The short version of this review can be summed up in one word: perfect. The outer insulation of this wire strips easily with either a romex stripping tool or (shudder) a sharp knife. The individual conductors’ insulation can be removed almost as easily as it’s not bonded to the surface of the copper conductor. Thankfully the conductors themselves are solid copper wire and not copper clad aluminum otherwise known as CCA. And for a bit more icing on the cake, this coil of Arizona Electrical Solutions wire costs less than half of what the same length coil of wire in the big box stores near me costs. And in case 25 feet of 14 gauge wire is not what you need for your next project, this company also sells other gauges and lengths here on Amazon. And again, it's made in America.

      "Alignment pins for making a taller work bench|||B0CL4QNJKB ★★★☆☆ [2024-01-24] <b>Does not store well!</b> This wire dispenser part of this works quite well. It is a sturdy construction aid, and a close rendition of the name brand that it tries to duplicate. Most everyone that works with electrical wiring has had to build a wire dispenser out of 2 x 4’s and such. This is definitely a better option, except when it comes time to snap them together and put them into the back of your truck or van! The instructions are well laid out and explain all kinds of uses. They also instruct you on how to snap this together for storing or to make a seat. Problem is, they don’t snap. They slide into place and then unslide as soon as they bounce around a bit driving down the road, or if you try to pick them up. They also come with alignment pins to make a 36” high work bench. The indents for storing the pins are so loose that I had to wrap them in a baggie so they would be tight enough to stay stowed away. If you don’t keep those pins with the dispenser, you won’t have them if you need a taller work bench. Overall I rated these a 3 star because two of the important features have a huge shortcoming. I prefer that my tools perform as advertised. I don’t recommend this item because for $25 more, you can get the original version that will probably last a lifetime, or longer.",

These have various holes and places to slip pipe through to give you a span to hold spools of wire. They have wide base that stays stable as you pull wire.

I had a couple projects coming up that were going to need some close quarters cable bending so I broke down and bought the Bend-All. It works at least some of the time and has saved effort – but it is far from perfect. First off, it is expensive for what it is. (That was painful but it only hurts once.) It seems unnecessarily big and clunky. It does not always fit in where it needs to go. Proportions could be better if it were a steel forging instead of being machined from an aluminum block. (How many of your other wrenches are machined from aluminum?) The posts have serrations on them to help keep them from slipping on the cable. Unfortunately, as the cable is bent, it needs to slide on one of the posts. This tends to dig in and damage the insulation. I put a piece of heat shrink tubing on one of the posts which seemed to help. Having one of the posts free to rotate would probably be even better. This tool is rated for up to 350 MCM conductors. I have only used it on 4/0. For my use, having a smaller version with the posts a bit closer together would be better. It would be nice if there were small recesses machined on the sides of the square drive hole for the ball detent on the socket wrench extension to engage in order to help keep the Bend-All from falling off. Overall, in spite of its shortcomings not a bad tool to have in your kit, but don’t expect miracles.",

Since the nuts are already fairly large the small amount of extra space could be helpful.",
      "Size compared to wire nuts|||B07CN5974J ★★★★★ [2020-02-29] <b>A Real Problem Solver</b> I really don't like working with 12-2 wire, especially in junction boxes where using wire nuts with four 12-2's can be a pain. These Wago's made the connection really easy. They're pricey, at least the 5 hole ones that I bought were, and they're slightly bigger than wire nuts, but well worth it. I'd also take the time to read the user's guide that arrives in the packet, that way you'd realize much sooner than I did that you have open the lever the full 90 degrees before you insert the wire. I'm giving these things my highest compliment: I'd buy them again.",

I hooked it up without issue, the instructions were detailed but when connecting the two twist connections the wire connectors they included were far too large.

I only have two issues with this and would probbaly have dinged a 1/2 star if that was an option: I measured one of the rolls to see if I was getting 20ft, and it came up about 4 inches short. This isn't too bad for 20ft, but I expect to get every inch I paid for. Now maybe some of the other rolls were longer, but I didn't verify. If that is the case then they need to be more consistant. The second issue involves using the box as a \"dispenser\". THere are holes in the back of the box to feed the wire. The problem is if you put all 6 spools in side by side, then there isn't enough room to close the lid or for the spools to spin. They came packed with the spools in a 2x3 configuration instead of the 1x6 configuration you would use for dispensing. This is because they don't fit otherwise. Looks like good wire. So if you dn't mind being shorted a couple of inches, and don't need the dispenser to work well with 6 rolls of wire, and otherwise this is a good value for you, then this is your product.

The cloth cover tends to unravel quickly when handled so it it works best when covered with tape where the cord is to be cut (not a big issue, but must be dealt with and makes the cords less easy to use than expected). I use a small flame to melt the synthetic cloth where it is cut to stop unraveling. Other reviewers claim this cord is not safe because it contains only two wires, which is FALSE - it depends on the application. Three-wire cable should be replaced with three-wire cable, so replacing a 2-wire cable with this cable is good practice. What matters more is replacing any cable with wire gauge as-big or bigger, and with a voltage rating suitable for the application."

      "Thick plastic construction|||B0CL4QNJKB ★★★★☆ [2024-01-31] <b>Super tough</b> As a ham radio hobbyist, I always have several spools of wire sitting around. You never know when you'll need to make a new antenna or put together an electronics kit. Normally my spools just sit on the shelf but now I can stay better organized and spool the length of wire out that I need easier. I was a little surprised at just how durable this stand is. The plastic is really thick. As in the description, you need to provide your own rods and can configure the setup based on the number and size of spools that you have. I don't personally get the purpose for the other uses for this device that are listed in the sales description. They say you can use it as a table, a chair, and half dozen other things. If you need a table, buy a table. If you need a chair, buy a chair. Yes, they do have it where this could work in a pinch, but I can't imagine anyone buying it for those purposes. It would be sub-optimal at best for any of the use cases aside from the wire spool holder. So, to the downside of this thing. The manufacturer should work on the packaging better. The instructions say it comes with two little pins for use in table mode. They don't exist for me. I did find a small plastic bag attached by tape to the device. The bag was empty. I'm assuming they were in that. Again, I don't expect to put it in table mode so not a big loss. The next thing affects me a little more. There are four rubber feet on each end, 8 in total. These are to keep it level and provide some cushioning. As received, mine has 5 of these rubber feet, missing 3 of them. To have the thing level, I’ll have to remove the remaining feet. The entire package is the two plastic pieces zip tied together, with the plastic bag taped to the side. The only packaging on top of that is a thin piece of cardboard printed with the logo and instructions sandwiched in to hold it. There is no protection for the feet, which are only glued on and can easily fall off. There is no protection for the plastic bag which is very likely to rip and have lost pieces before it gets to you. Personally, I'm still satisfied overall with this device. I'll just be going to the hardware store to find some rubber furniture feet for it myself.",

The instructions show a piece of 2 x 4” holding the two pieces together. I don’t currently have a board in place, and it seems fine. But I will probably add one since I only plan to use it for a single spool of NM and won’t be changing its configuration. It will keep everything together as a tight unit. I really like the handles on this product. It makes moving a spool a lot easier!

      "Robust and strong plastic|||B0CL4QNJKB ★★★☆☆ [2024-01-08] <b>Half Finished</b> The plastic seems robust and strong with a claimed load carrying capacity of 330 lbs when used as directed for holding spools of wire or sitting on it as a stool. Regarding directions, they are excellent. Written in clear, concise, and informative American English. The way the two halves nest together for carrying and each stand have carrying hands on 3 sides makes carrying them convenient. Unfortunately, while they got lots right, the product feels half baked; while it can be very useful now, hopefully the next version will correct some of the following shortcomings. The location on the rack for storing the stand stacking pins does NOT work, because the channel where they go is wider than the pins' diameter, so they just fall out. In other words, there is no mechanical catch or other device to hold the pins in their storage location. This problem could have been easily fixed with four small 3/8 to ½ inch button magnet, one pair at each end of the two storage channels. A quick search shows that four rare earth magnets would add only slightly more than 1 cent ($0.0125) to the materials cost of the product. My other initial concern is will the ¾ to 1 inch conduit or rigid pipe they recommend for suspending spools of wire between the supports stay in place if the wire is pulled off the spools at an angle toward either support vs perpendicular to the support pipe and parallel to the supports or will the pipe slip out of the hole in the stand."

However, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment when the pliers broke after just one week of use. The concept behind these pliers is great – nonconductive material to prevent electrical shocks and damage. They felt sturdy enough at first, but it became apparent that the quality simply wasn't there. The plastic began to crack and chip after minimal use, and eventually, one of the jaws snapped off entirely. This is incredibly frustrating, especially considering the price point of these pliers.

      "Plastic parts|||B0CJ3Y1BNQ ★★★★★ [2024-01-22] <b>Decent waterproof coupler/connector</b> The description calls this a “connector”. The distinction is subtle but this is technically a coupler: it couples two cables. But it is also a connector because it connects the electrical conductors inside the cable. In any case, the connector should be considered a permanent connector, as much as anything is truly permanent. Because the various components are all screwed together, these connection and coupling processes can both be reversed, I can decouple the cable and disconnect the wires. This connector is, however, NOT a not quick disconnect device. It is not intended for frequent decoupling or even multiple disconnects and re-connects. The plastic seals will most likely lose their ability to seal properly, but it should support an occasional disconnect. My Intended Use: I plan to use these connectors on my fishing light cable to extend the depth from 15 ft to about 40 feet. I fish for kokanee in winter under the ice. They can be found anywhere from 10 ft deep to about 40 ft. My fishing light only comes with a 15 ft cable. So, it needs an extension. The connector to do this will need to be waterproof to about 30 ft (approx. 9 m) for a handful of hours at a time. In this use, I may need to occasionally reconnect things as fine tune it. For best security, I should probably use a new connector each time... I won’t be able to actually use this extended light until we have safe ice conditions. I will report back on my experience as soon as possible. IP68 Rating and Maximum Depth: What is the actual depth rating – and duration – for this connector? The IP68 rating only means that the device will remain waterproof essentially indefinitely, down to the depth specified by the manufacturer. [OK, here comes the really nerdy part of this reviewer...] One: According to the Product Description page, this connector has an IP68 rating down to a depth of 3 meters with an unstated but implied indefinite duration, technically not deep enough for my use. However, the PDF documents in the Product guides and documents section, give different specifications. Two: The “Technical Report” (see “Certificate of Analysis” link) states that the test specification for the IEC60528 standard for IPX8 lists the Test conditions for the IPX8 rating as 2 meters for 120 hrs. The test to verify this was performed at 2 meters, and passed. Three: In the “Attestation of Conformity” document attached to the “Safety Information” link, it says that the rated conditions were specified by the client as120 hours down to 4 meters. The test for this specification was performed at 4 meters, and also passed. Since one of these tests was performed at 4 meters, we can assume it is waterproof for up to 120 hours down to 4 meters. This is still less than my desired depth of 9 meters but since I will be using this connector for only a couple hours at a time, I think it will be OK. I will report back after I verify this on the ice. After connecting (and coupling) the fish light cable and my extension cable, I can say that the connection feels secure and looks to be waterproof. One should probably use appropriate ferrules on the ends of the wires to be screwed into the connector, but I tinned mine with solder. This means that I had to re-tighten the screws a couple of times before considering the connection permanent and closing it up. I like these connectors. They look secure and should be waterproof enough for my needs. My only complaint for them is the lack of information on assembly. Specifically, I would like to know how TIGHTLY to twist the parts together. They need to be tight enough so the seals become and remain waterproof, yet not so tight that the plastic parts split open in the long term. Despite that I still give thee connectors a 5 star rating. (At least, down to 30 feet... :)",

Now there's no question that this is a contemporary AC plug, and if you're doing a genuine restoration, you probably won't go this route, but there's also no question that this is a safe approach and one that is probably going to be hidden by furniture anyway. In this case, the fabric wrap covers two independently insulated wires, already stripped and soldered and ready to be wired directly into your device, lamp, appliance, etc. The fabric has a nice sheen and looks great; I picked the brown color to go with a copper lamp - works perfectly.",

Once I rewired my lamps, I found that I love the vintage look of the wire so I decided to make some \"vintage\" extension cords using repro antique plugs and some new old stock surface mount receptacles. They look really cool, and they don't spoil the vintage look of my room and my lamps. Just remember that this is 18 gauge wire so you don't want it to be carrying more than 15 amps.

Hopefully tinned part would also help longevity of terminations. Wire stripping is ok with a regular stripping tool, may require rotating the wire before final pull to cut the insulation jacket around. Did not notice any cut wires if done with care. Since the individual wires are so thin, it definitely requires ferrules if going into screw terminations. Or rings. Definitely not for terminating a bare wire.

      "Silver appearance due to tinning process|||B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ [2023-02-13] <b>Great quality automotive & marine wire</b> This is perfect wire for automotive use, including campers and marine applications. The conductors are fine stranded, tinned copper, which is a thin protective coating on the copper to keep it from corroding in harsh environments such as ocean areas, or auto applications where winter road salting can cause problems. Despite what other reviewers have said, this is indeed copper wire, but the “tinning” process makes the wire appear silver unless you look at the cut end. It is typically used with crimp connectors in most applications. There is no indication that this wire is UL listed, so I would not use it for home-wiring applications or any 120 volt (or higher) AC current. The silicone insulation and fine stranding make this wire very flexible, so perfect for sharp turns and pulling through tight locations like behind the dash. The 14 gauge that I used is good for any circuits of up to 10 amps unless they are longer than 25 feet or so. Remember to calculate for both positive and negative lengths, and whether you can afford any voltage drop in your circuit. Circuits for an automotive refrigerator or fog lamps, which have extended use times for example, are different than a circuit for a horn, which is only used for a couple seconds at a time. This seems to be a very good quality and well manufactured wire, and is available in a wide variety of gauges, both red and black.",

A bit concerning is that it is hard to see the copper to assess it. It is hard to see from the cut end and when I do get a bit of copper color I am not sure if it is a reflection. I scraped the tinning off from the sides and got a little pale pinkish color. Maybe it is just that the strand count is so high (small strands) or that the copper is of a different purity than what I am used to seeing. I am sure the wire is fine, but there is definitely something different about it.",

Looked at and tried many types and they were never flexible enough to give me the comfort that they wouldn't bind or have the wires break inside. This stuff flexes so well that it can be routed easily and definitely will clean up the wiring, it even maintains it's path and doesn't flop to the side so it won't need anything more than a strand of filament to keep it inline and away from motion parts. I can run all 3 fans, thermistor, and 3 wire LEDs in this one cable with all their individual wires hooked up. If you run even a cheap breakout toolhead and deck pcb with a common ground you can add in the 5 BL probe wires into it and only have your servo cable and heater wires separate in the sleeving, which they should be anyways due to size/current differences. All this in a 6mm or so package. I did tidy wiring before but could never get all the wires to less than 11-12mm and they were always lumpy and didn't flex well binding up my toolhead on certain movements. This will help me get it down to less than 10mm diameter in total. If i upgrade to a board system i'll definitely come back to see if there's a cable with the proper number i need to keep all the low voltage in one.

Be sure you know what you're buying. This is ultra flexible, with many super-fine strands and silicone rubber insulation marked 200C (higher than PVC but lower than PTFE). The fine strands (150 of them, but I didn't count!) can be a bit of a challenge when crimping contacts... make sure no microscopic strands escape the crimp -- then it works great. The insulation is thick but soft: very easy to work with but also easily damaged if used in the wrong application. It's the right cable for routing in tight locations, since it's so willing to bend and lay flat... good for DIY drones (flexing arms or retracting legs) or making wiring harnesses that need to flex but are well protected from abrasion and pinching. For more rugged high-temp insulation, consider PTFE but it is much more difficult to work with and hard to find at a reasonable price. As noted by others, some colors are a bit off. Red is clearly orange, and blue is gray-purple. That's okay for my purposes, but maybe not if you are building to a print for assemblies that will be inspected. The velcro wraps keep each spool neat, and the box is good for organizing these spools when lots of other wire spools are around.",

I checked the gauge size with a wire stripper and not one strand of copper came with the casing. It's pretty soft and pliable which I like because it makes the connectors much easier to install into the wire.The package says \"sunlight resistant\", not sure if that is different than UV resistant, but I bury/cover all of my wire so I'm not worried about that. Another note, it has a max of 300W on the line so do your math but with LED lighting now, good luck using that much per 100 feet! Lastly, I was at my usual hardware store yesterday and 12-2 @100ft, was $138.00. I was floored.",

I would not use the wire in a location where it is exposed to the elements but for use inside a PVC conduit or indoors, it works perfectly and should last forever. Its easy to work with (cut, strip, solder). I liked that the pure copper strands wick solder immediately without having to apply excess heat which can damage the soft insulation.

      "Firm yet flexible|||B0C9H1G52F ★★★★★ [2023-10-10] <b>Works well - Good value</b> All copper products have gotten to noise-bleed pricing of late. Even running low voltage wire is just ridiculously expensive especially if you run to one of the home stores. Ad frankly , if you're ordering wire without knowing what it is or seeing/feeling it, it can be a little scary as the quality varies so much. This wire arrives on a wooden core. Okay - that makes 500ft of heavy a little heavier, but you know they care about their product. It's also probably the only way to ship it so it doesn't end up as a bundle of knotted wire when it arrives in your standard Amazon box which in my case was shipped through UPS and clearly had a tough ride. But 500 feet of wire is pretty heavy at about 22 lbs on a 10x10-ish core. And the wire made it fine with a nice sheet of cardboard wrapped around the wire in between the core ends. The box clearly won over whichever UPS employee was fighting with it. The wire just feels like quality. It''s a firm, yet flexible outer sheath holding the two separate strands of 16 gauge wire. The sheath is UV resistant and rated for direct burial. It's UL listed and RoHS rated. It seems like a quality product and for purposes it's great. My use case is extending an existing low voltage run along the side of the property of the house to the back and introducing low voltage lights to the back yard. In southern Florida, the groundwater is high, the weather humid, and the sun hot. What better test ground for this? Anyhow it's ultimately gonna be buried under landscape rocks yet above landscape fabric in most places. Others will be direct burial In certain spots known for puddling. I expect no issues given the quality of this wire. And at 16Awg I expect it to be able to carry the 12 volts I need without concern. Highly recommend.",

This iGreely 10awg 30ft cable is another great product. They have been my go-to for low voltage wire and cables for my solar setup and vehicles. I ran this cable under my gazebo, where I have a little solar setup. I usually go out there and do movie nights on my days off from work. This cable is 30 feet black and 30 feet red. Some brands advertise 30 feet, but later, you find out they meant 15 feet black and 15 feet red. I can confirm that the wire is copper and not just coated. The insulation feels durable. It is thick but still very easy to bend. This is great if you dont have a straight shot where you are running it. I have the cable running from my solar panel on the roof down to my solar controller. I haven't fully cut the cable to size yet because Im thinking of reconfiguring my setup. I may change some things around and wanted to keep some slack. I did cut off a few pieces to make some MC4 cables. This cable has been through storms, the sun, rain, etc... even through the bad weather, it has held up great.

This wire will char very quickly if you use a small butane torch as a heat source. I intentionally lit some of it on fire to see what would happen and it extinguished itself very quickly so I feel like it's safe to use in most applications.

      "sturdy structure|||B0CL4QNJKB ★★★★★ [2023-12-18] <b>Multi Purpose Wire Dispenser</b> In the process of organizing and dispensing wire spools, I used this device, and its adaptability instantly stood out to me. A solution that can support a broad variety of wire diameters is provided by the design, which can accommodate spools with a diameter of up to 34 inches. The load capability of 330 pounds per pair guarantees that even heavy spools are well-supported, which contributes to a dispensing experience that is both smooth and regulated. The sturdy structure and careful design provide a stable platform for the wire spools, which eliminates the possibility of the wire spools swaying or toppling while they are being dispensed. Without causing any kinking or tangling, the dispensing process itself is smooth, making it possible to unwind without any difficulty. Since I started using this wire spool caddy, I have seen a discernible improvement in the way that my workstation is designed and organized. In order to improve my work process and reduce the amount of time I spend looking for and untangling wires, it is helpful to have the capability to stack numerous spools and have them immediately accessible. The black finish lends an air of professionalism to the general atmosphere of the workplace, which is characterized by a high level of polish and effectiveness.",

      "Sturdy construction|||B0CL4QNJKB ★★★☆☆ [2024-01-24] <b>Does not store well!</b> This wire dispenser part of this works quite well. It is a sturdy construction aid, and a close rendition of the name brand that it tries to duplicate. Most everyone that works with electrical wiring has had to build a wire dispenser out of 2 x 4’s and such. This is definitely a better option, except when it comes time to snap them together and put them into the back of your truck or van! The instructions are well laid out and explain all kinds of uses. They also instruct you on how to snap this together for storing or to make a seat. Problem is, they don’t snap. They slide into place and then unslide as soon as they bounce around a bit driving down the road, or if you try to pick them up. They also come with alignment pins to make a 36” high work bench. The indents for storing the pins are so loose that I had to wrap them in a baggie so they would be tight enough to stay stowed away. If you don’t keep those pins with the dispenser, you won’t have them if you need a taller work bench. Overall I rated these a 3 star because two of the important features have a huge shortcoming. I prefer that my tools perform as advertised. I don’t recommend this item because for $25 more, you can get the original version that will probably last a lifetime, or longer.",

It came with two pins so you could put the two ends top edge to edge to make some kind of taller table....though it's a bit flimsy so don't bump it. Supposedly there are two spots to secure the pins, but the spot indicated doesn't hold the included pins at all. Also, it has four rubber feet on each of the ends.

They are very thick and sturdy, and are stable in all of the different configurations they're designed for. I have just two little nits about these: 1. There are two small steel bars that act as connecting pegs, to hold the two plates together vertically. They don't get used often, so there's a very good chance they'll get lost. There are a couple of indented areas on each plate that look like the bars should be stored in; but the bars just fall out. There's nothing to hold them in. With all of the careful, thoughtful, designing that went into this system; I'm amazed this wasn't dealt with. 2. The two halves clip together nicely, but there's no good way to store them. The assembly is still very bulky and awkward, even after disassembling it and clipping the two halves together -- and they will fall apart if you try to hang them up. Bottom line: A couple of little issues that should be considered; but still an amazingly useful product.",

Compared a known 18 AWG wire with this company's 18 AWG, and the wire looks the same thickness (although silver-colored, not copper-looking), but the insulation is a good 25-30% thinner. Going to order 16 AWG and see what that looks like. Running new white and black wire in a jukebox for fluorescent lighting and power, and it's supposed to be the same size as 18 AWG zip cord, so there's little doubt in my mind that their 16 gauge will be good enough for the job.

      "brass colored version available|||B0BRN8DWTL ★★★★★ [2023-03-06] <b>Looks great, provides old fashion appearance, with safe modern materials</b> I have tried the brass colored version of this and have to say that the pictures in the product listing are a very accurate representation. The cord looks as good in person as the photos show. It is a reasonable facsimile for either replacing antiquated electrical wiring in old lamps and such, or adding a little extra visual flair to current devices. Of course, when replacing old wiring, you are also gaining the safety of a cord that is using modern insulating materials, which is much safer at this point, than older wiring which may have very dry and brittle insulation layers between the strands of wire. The only comment I can make about it that may be a negative factor for some is that the cord is round, rather than most lamp cord that tends to be a bit flattened. This may also have something to do with this cord being a little stiffer than the typical lamp cord you may be most familiar with."

This product really saved the day in this situation! As you can see in the attached picture, I was able to wire each of the lights in sequence without any issues. A few specific thoughts: - These wire nuts contain the exact right amount of silicone to make them waterproof without causing the silicone to run all over the wires. Some comparable products are \"over-filled\" with silicone and it squirts out and makes a mess of everything (including your hands). - The bright blue color stands out really well against dirt, leaves, etc., making the wire connections easy to spot even when working in low light. - Every single wire nut gripped the wires tightly and held them firmly. I HIGHLY recommend always giving the wires a gentle tug after tightening a wire nut just to be sure that they will not slip out over time.",

I bought this pack primarily for one cable to use in my car. I have a car charger that has 2 USB-C outputs. One is higher powered than the other. The high power one has a red cable and i wanted a different cable to differentiate the lower power output so blue worked for me. Again, the thickness of the cable (which doesn't really have any effect on it's flexibility) helps me locate this particular one in the dark of my car without having to turn on the lights. I also liked that there's a cable tie included with each cable making storage in my car's center console nice and neat. Since this came with two cables, I used the other one at my desk in my office to charge my phone. I have a Samsung wireless charging pad and this fits perfectly. It doesn't charge too fast, though, so if i need a quick charge or if i want to charge while i use my phone, i can unplug the charging pad and plug directly into my phone for a high powered fast charge.

This wire is easy to use, store and affordable enough to keep a 1000' roll on hand for last minute add on projects. anyone that does Holiday lighting as a hobby already knows there are always last minute projects in the rule of thumb is have two of everything on hand even if you only need one. I'm at around 6,000 feet worth of spt-1 wire right now and probably 1200 total vampire plugs. So much easier to cut to length and use vampire plugs on it rather than those heavy store bought extension cords. One trick I have learned is to get a silver paint marker and write on the slide on plugs what the wire controls This helps both for storage as well as set up next year. This wire has saved my back because it is lightweight and not heavy for storage. I can store 3,000 ft worth of this wire with plugs on it in a tote versus only being able to put in 9 of the 100 ft extension cords from the stores back in the old days. Plus the green color hides well even during the daylight hours. The polarized wire is ribbed so it's easy to make sure when you're putting on plugs they are all going in the proper direction. It's up to us Holiday Fanatics to light up the world. You won't be disappointed. In northern states you may want to use spt to due to the freezing weather.

This cord I used on a pair of weighted swing wall lamps. These are my absolute favorite style of lamp next to the saucer-look pull-down ceiling lamp. I have two of those as well! Anyway, the lampshades are the two-tiered fiberglass shades with the \"whip stitching\" along the edges. The fiberglass shades are a beige color so the brown electrical cord goes really well with them and the gold swing piece that is attached to the wall.

      "12 AWG version usually yellow|||B0C5FC1KJZ ★★★★☆ [2023-06-05] <b>Repackaged Encore brand</b> I received Encore brand nonmetallic (NM) sheathed cable that has been repackaged under the Arizona Electrical name. Some people say that’s it’s more stiff and the sheath doesn’t slide as smoothly as the big brand ones (Southwire Romex and Cerrowire), but even the professionals mostly grumble and deal with it if Encore is what their supply house gives them. For that matter, Arizona Electrical might be sticking their label on whatever their supply house gives them too, so for all I know you may get something different from Encore. But it’s all UL listed cable, so it shouldn’t matter too much. I have some Southwire Romex on hand also, and I can’t say any profound difference jumps out at me. I connected the black and white wires together to get a 200 ft loop to test wire resistance. My meter said 0.6 ohm, and the leads were about 0.1 ohm so that leaves 0.5 ohm for the NM-B wire, which is right on for 200 ft of 14 AWG. Always check with your local inspecting authorities, but broadly speaking this 14 AWG wire (called 14/2 because it has two conductors that nominally carry current, not counting the ground wire) is typically used for residential 15 amp, 120 volt circuits behind drywall where it’s not subject to damage (typically at least 1.25” from a penetrable surface, otherwise you’d protect it with a metal plate so someone doesn’t hammer a nail into it). Less commonly, it can be used for a 15 amp 240 volt circuit if you don’t need a neutral wire (repurposing the white as a second “hot” rather than a neutral, and marking it with black electrical tape to indicate as much). If you are on a 20 amp breaker, you typically need to use the thicker 12 AWG version of this product (which is usually yellow these days). But as long as you’re on a 15 amp breaker, 14 AWG is less expensive and more flexible - making it easier to work with. These days, you typically see 15 amp circuits used for lighting and 20 amp circuits for receptacles, but especially in older homes your mileage may vary. The cable should typically be secured with cable staples along its length so it doesn’t pull loose, and needs a protective bushing if it's terminating inside a metal enclosure so it doesn't get damaged. Overall, NM-B cable is probably the easiest and most economical option unless there’s some reason it’s not appropriate to use in your application. But do not under any circumstances use this where it might get wet. There is a different version (UF-B rather than NM-B) that is rated for direct burial outdoors and can get wet. This product is also probably not what you want if you’re running the wires inside conduit, where you would typically use either THHN (dry) or THWN (potentially wet, including underground). I will say, though, that you'll probably get better value from a 250 ft roll than this 100 ft roll. If you really only need 100 ft for a one-off project, then that's fine. But if you're ever going to need to buy more in the future then you might consider just buying the big roll now. Electricity is potentially dangerous, so please don’t attempt anything unless you’re confident you can do it safely. Always shut off the power to whatever circuit you’re working on and confirm by some means (be it a tester or plugging a lamp into the receptacle) that the power really is off before servicing it. It’s important to make good solid connections so they don’t overheat. Wires should be pre-twisted tightly together with a big pair of pliers before screwing on a conventional wire nut. If you’re not confident or just want to make that part of the job quicker and easier, Wago 221 connectors are a more nearly foolproof option. If you’re attaching to a screw on a receptacle, be sure to get it nice and snug (don’t go wild but you do want to tighten it down pretty well). All splices need to be inside a box that is accessible (i.e., don't bury it behind drywall where no one will ever be able to find it again).",

The antenna has been used in out in the field a dozen times or so, and seems to be holding up well. It's remained pliable and hasn't gotten any breaks in the insulation over three months or so of getting kicked around. That said, I ordered the pink to make it visible. Instead of neon pink (or even vibrant pink, as the listing image shows), it's a much more muted and tasteful dusty rose color.

      "White surface material|||B079NXCN6B ★☆☆☆☆ [2020-04-17] <b>Started peeling off in less than a day</b> It doesn't stay stuck to my wall. I followed the instructions and watched the video beforehand. I wiped the wall with a damp microfiber to remove any dust and let it dry. I then applied the Ghost Wire starting at one end, peeling about a foot of the backing off at a time, smoothing it and rubbing it to the wall. Working the wrinkles out as I went along. Within one day, both ends of the run had about 6 inches peeling off the wall. Three days later, and both ends are now peeled off about 2 feet. Every morning I've tried to rub it back to the wall. My walls do have a very slight orange peel texture. Perhaps on a smooth finish the Ghost Wire would adhere better. I have not attempted to paint over it yet (and likely won't since it doesn't stay on). The total length of my application was 11.5 feet. Beyond the issue of it not remaining adhered, there were a couple other issues as well. First, there's about 1/8 of clear adhesive which is not covered by the white surface material running down the entire length of the roll. This is very visible (and sticky feeling). I was hoping that I could spray some wall texture over it since paint will likely not cover it correctly. I also snapped off my exposed ends when attaching the end connectors. Since the copper is very thin, any etching done with a razor blade to cleanly expose the copper strips weakens it to the point that any flex will shear it off. I had to peel back and use scissors, leaving a small flap rather than a nice clean transition. My Ghost Wire also was quite wrinkled from being rolled up. The manufacturer states that it's a known issue and recommends a heatgun/hairdryer to remedy so I expected that going in I liked the idea of this product. If it would have stayed on the wall, it would have been great. Even with the problems I had, I could see this working well if run under a carpet. I'm contemplating using a router to notch a shallow channel in the drywall and then just mud over the inserted wire. [update] A week later, and it's completely peeled off. Not an inch is left stuck to the wall. It's just hanging between the two connector blocks that are screwed in.",

And the brown, red, and orange are not that distinguishable on their own. Where I expected to find 'gray' as one of the 10 colors, instead they provide a 'pink'.",

      "Clean, finished, and professional look|||B01B6R0OKQ ★★★★★ [2023-07-06] <b>Works well, looks nice</b> I installed some wireless, solar-powered security cameras on my house and was concerned about the longevity of the USB cable used to connect the solar panels to the cameras. The cords are permanently attached to the panels and cannot be replaced, so I didn't want them exposed constantly to sunlight and weather. So I ordered a 10' roll of the 3/8th\" tubing. I measure out how much cable length I'd need plus a little slack, then I wrapped the excess around one or both of the panel/camera mounts (depending on how much unused cable length there'd be) and wrapped self-bonding silicone tape around the cable to secure/waterproof/protect it. Then I cut an appropriate length of the split tubing and slipped it over the exposed cable between the two, then for some cameras where necessary I cut a smaller piece or two and added them to the small amount of slack I left after the wrapping. Where appropriate I wrapped a small amount of the silicone tape on the ends to keep it in place/further waterproof it. This gives a clean, finished, and professional look. I was impressed with the results so much I've ordered more additional cameras, as well as to help reorganize some computer cable routing. I'm up to 5 rolls so far, I just wish the larger sizes were also available in 10' lengths for a similar price.",

I’m not about to go and unravel this whole thing just to measure if they gave 50ft but based on what I am seeing, that appears to be the case. I like this wire, I know it will be useful in the future. I plan to use it to wire some outdoor lights in the sun room at my park model when it opens up again for the season. Upon inspection of the wire it appears brand new and there are no signs of damage anywhere on the wire. I’m not sure why this wire is tinned because generally you would utilize screw on caps in order to secure the junction between two wires in a home rough in environment.

      "Available in red and black colors|||B09VGLY361 ★★★★★ [2023-02-13] <b>Great quality automotive & marine wire</b> This is perfect wire for automotive use, including campers and marine applications. The conductors are fine stranded, tinned copper, which is a thin protective coating on the copper to keep it from corroding in harsh environments such as ocean areas, or auto applications where winter road salting can cause problems. Despite what other reviewers have said, this is indeed copper wire, but the “tinning” process makes the wire appear silver unless you look at the cut end. It is typically used with crimp connectors in most applications. There is no indication that this wire is UL listed, so I would not use it for home-wiring applications or any 120 volt (or higher) AC current. The silicone insulation and fine stranding make this wire very flexible, so perfect for sharp turns and pulling through tight locations like behind the dash. The 14 gauge that I used is good for any circuits of up to 10 amps unless they are longer than 25 feet or so. Remember to calculate for both positive and negative lengths, and whether you can afford any voltage drop in your circuit. Circuits for an automotive refrigerator or fog lamps, which have extended use times for example, are different than a circuit for a horn, which is only used for a couple seconds at a time.

As I'm sure is the case most of the time, the wire insulation is all red with one side of it dyed black. The black side of it was notably more difficult to strip with my auto-strippers than the red side; probably due to the coloring process.

The copper wire construction is durable and resistant to wear and tear, ensuring that it can withstand the elements and provide reliable performance for years to come. I appreciate the most about this wire is how easy it is to work with. It is flexible and easy to bend, making it easy to route around landscaping features and other obstacles. It is also color-coded for easy identification and installation, which made the process of setting up my outdoor lighting system a breeze. The 50-foot length is more than enough for most outdoor projects, and the low voltage rating ensures that it is safe to use around plants and other outdoor features. This wire is ideal for use with low voltage LED lighting systems, which are becoming increasingly popular for their energy efficiency and ease of use.

The package includes five spools of very nice quality wire with five different color insulation used. Each spool has 20 feet of wire. I really like the insulation on this wire. It's a soft silicone vs vinyl which I most often used in the past. This gives the wire great flexibility, as well as heat and abrasion resistance. The most commonly used red and black (for positive and negative DC wiring) are represented, as well as white, blue, and yellow. The wire consists of (according to the ad) 252 individual tiny strands of tinned copper wire. I didn't order this pack for any particular purpose in mind, but rather to have on hand when needed.

The wires are Red, Black and Yellow. The jacket is probably thicker than it needs to be but that may be because of the direct burial rating. I won't be burying mine but I'm confident that it would be ok. The inner wires have a very thin jacket. Some reviewers had a tough time stripping the wires but that may be the fault of the wire strippers. The Vise-Grip wire strippers are excellent and easily stripped the jacket off these wires. Even with the thick outer insulation the wire is very flexible. Price per foot seems a bit high though it is a short length.",

As awful as that can be, having this kit to keep wires separated while also allowing continuous easy access to fresh wire is as good of a helping hand as you are going to get, aside from a good wiring diagram. The wire is of good quality and it stays neatly spooled up on the rolls. Hopefully this roll will last me quite a while but if need be I would buy this item again."

Heck maybe it is even dark red, idk the point is it is not the clearly red red of the same brand's other gauges. That's not a nitpick; when circuits get complex these distinctions are crucial. Red is the color i use for positive power in my projects. Once i get a street map of wires on the back of perfboard i can confuse my own self just fine without also having to suss out ambiguous wire colors. I've attached a photo to illustrate. I wanted to make a side-by-side comparison to my 24 gauge wire but couldn't get the lighting right to show the contrast. Doesn't matter... when i opened the box i thought, \"that's orange wire\". I've since decided it's probably brown. But i'm not gonna gaslight myself, dangit, it ain't red. There's a whole science to naming visible light wavelengths and all the attendant complications and i have neither the expertise nor the tools. You look at pic and decide for yourself if it's red enough to be red in your projects. I've been generally very happy with this brand. I'd be five stars of happy with this shipment too if it weren't for this issue. The wire itself is good stuff. Sorry. I'll go get on with my (ever so slightly more complicated) life now.",

It's easy to work with, and the wires inside are made of quality materials. While the non-standard color code (red/yellow/black instead of green/white/black) may not be ideal for all applications, it's a minor concern given the overall performance."

      "Wire stripper|||B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ [2024-03-10] <b>Good variety kit, high quality wire</b> I ordered this wire to use with DIY electronics projects as well as wiring accessory devices in my electric bike. The main reason why I chose this wire over cheaper wire variety packs is because this wire has silicone insulation which is more durable, flexible, and heat resistant than conventional wire insulation. The silicone insulation did not disappoint. You can see in the video I attached that the insulation is quite resistant to heat and does not melt as easily. Notice the reaction of the bare wire to heat in the video as well. The wire is indeed tinned and when you heat it, the tinning material evaporates and the bare copper wire is left underneath. This is something you should take into consideration when connecting these wires to a terminal since the tinning should be removed in order to get a solid connection. Probably a regular lighter is more suited to this task than a blow torch. Overall I am very satisfied with this wire kit. The wire is all very high quality and perfect for automotive applications due to the heat and wear resistance of the silicone insulation. This kit also comes with a wire stripper, some zip ties, and heat shrink. I could care less about these extras but it might be a nice perk if you don't have these items already. I would highly recommend this kit if you need a variety of different colored wires for an automotive project. The silicone insulation is the best you can get.",

Having an assortment of wire on hand helps ensure I'm using the right wire for the job both in function and appearance (color coding). This assortment includes 8 spools of silicone insulated 18AWG wire in different colors, along with heatshrink tubing and wire ties in matching colors which is a nice touch for neater, more professional looking wiring jobs. The spools are included in a box with holes to allow for dispensing, but the spools lay flat in the box -- not on edge like other boxes of dispensable wire I have. This isn't really an issue, just an odd choice and it makes the box a bit wider and flatter compared to a vertical orientation. Also included is a very basic wire stripper, though I don't use it as I have more capable wire strippers at hand. I would tend to challenge the specs/rating sheet included. Generally I wouldn't suggest anywhere near 22A be run through 18AWG wire. More like half that, tops. While the silicone insultation will help reduce the chance of fire from an over current situation compared to PVC or other materials, it will still get very hot and is a grossly inefficient application of power, with so much energy being lost as heat due to the resistance of the wire. Further, seeing the recommendation here could lead the inexperienced to conclude that's a safe current for any similarly sized wire. Otherwise, I'm quite satisfied with this product.",
      "Includes wire stripper|||B0D2NZY48M ★★★★★ [2024-03-22] <b>Great Hobbyist Kit for Arduino/Control Systems</b> I think this kit is useful for arduino or control system projects, where it may be confusing to only see red/black wires everywhere. It makes it less painful to trace wires to their appropriate I/O (e.g. motors, buttons, etc). The box having holes for each spool is a creative touch that makes it trivial to pull out wire without having to actually open the box. The additional wire stripper was unnecessary to add, but a nice touch for hobbyists who might not have a lot of equipment. It takes a few attempts to figure out the right technique for stripping the wire, but it is definitely usable in place of a dedicated wire stripper. The wire itself was as-advertised and the high voltage and amperage rating makes this suitable for almost all use cases (beyond excessive power delivery).",
      "Includes wire stripper|||B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ [2024-03-14] <b>Great wire for hobbyists</b> This wire kit makes a great kit for hobbyists who need several pieces of different colored wires in a project. This kit comes with 8 rolls of wire (brown, white, black, red, orange, blue, yellow, and green), a bag of zip ties, a bag of heat-shrink tubing, and a wire stripper. The bags of zip ties and heat-shrink tubing include zip ties and heat-shrink tubing that match the colors of the wires with the exception of black zip ties. The kit I received did not include any black zip ties but those are easy to find elsewhere. The wire features silicone insulation and is very flexible. The insulation is soft enough that it can be easily stripped by simply pinching and pulling on the insulation. This makes the wire easy to work with but causes some concern for how easy the wire could be damaged. The box features holes that make it easy to pull the wires out of the box while keeping the spools contained in the box. The included wire stripper is very simple but a good addition to the kit. Most hobbyists will prefer to use their own wire strippers, but some beginners may find the included wire stripper useful. Overall, this wire kit seems like a great kit for hobbyists who prefer a clean and organized project and workspace.",

      "Wire stripper|||B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ [2024-03-07] <b>It's wire</b> It's a little hard to write a review on an item like wire. Is it of the right thickness? It seems to be. Is the insulation intact? Is seems to be. Does it work to conduct electricity? Yes. So I guess that's what you want from wire. According to the box, this wire is made of tinned copper, as opposed to bare copper. My understanding is that \"tinned copper\" (with a thin coating of tin around a copper wire) helps with resistance to oxidation, and is especially beneficial in high-moisture environments. This kit comes with a bag of small zip ties and a bag of heat-shrink tubing (looks like about 25 of each), as well as a small wire stripper, which is appreciated. So far, this wire is working well, and I am happy with this item.",

This kit makes that so much easier! The wire is high quality tinned copper with a thick silicone insulation that can withstand high voltage and temperature. The wire itself takes solder beautifully, the insulation doesn’t melt when soldering, and it is flexible enough to be used in most situations. The kit also includes some color matched heat-shrink tubing, small zip-ties, and a mini wire stripper. You can keep the wire spools in the box and pull out small lengths as needed or add them to your spool holder like I did (see photo). This wire kit is an excellent choice for any DIY hobbyist who appreciates having a selection of high quality wire on hand for their projects.

Various sizes of shrink tubing are included to finish off any application. Comes with a nice selection of lever style hard connectors that can be reused. In order to put this kit to work the needed tools are included, a crimper to attach the terminals. This is an upgraded crimper, that is multitudes better than the old style hand crimper that used to be a part of these kits. The wire strippers work perfect to prepare the wires and also included is a pair of work gloves. One thing I found out using this kit is there are no instructions as to usage, when prepping wires for terminals, especially the barrel connectors to splice together wires, make sure you strip only about 1/4” of wire or as in case of the barrel connector, issues can result. Other then the lack of a strip gauge this kit is well supplied and can be a godsend when a problem occurs our during a installation.",

However, vehicle wiring comes in many many more colours. This kit is just what I needed. The box itself acts as a dispenser for the wires so you can keep every colour organised on its spool without it unwinding on you. My only issue with this design is, with the wire inside the box, you can't see how much you have left. With some colours, 16ft goes quickly. I absolutely enjoy the colour matching zip ties and heat shrink. I hate putting black heat shrink on coloured wire. Drives me crazy. When I first opened the box, I laughed at the wire stripper. I was going to bash it, but honestly, it's not bad. Works better and safer than me pushing wire between my thumb and pocket knife blade. The wire I show in the picture was stripped using the wire strippers provided. There are four different sized slots on the strippers for four different sized wires, but they aren't labelled, so be sure to double check before cutting in.

      "Includes wire stripper|||B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ [2024-03-06] <b>A Comprehensive Starter Set for Electronics Enthusiasts</b> The 18 Gauge Wire Kit offers an excellent starting point for anyone delving into the realm of electronics, whether as a hobbyist or a budding professional. This kit is particularly appealing for its thoughtful compilation of essential wiring needs, presented in a user-friendly package. Variety and Quality: One of the standout features of this kit is the variety it offers—eight colors of 18 gauge silicone wire, each extending to 23 feet (7 meters). While the length of each spool might not cater to extensive projects, the assortment allows for ample experimentation and small-scale builds. The choice of silicone for the wire sheathing is a commendable one, providing a durable, heat-resistant covering that forgives the occasional soldering mishap, making it an ideal selection for beginners. Additionally, silicone's chemical resistance and flexibility are qualities that veteran electronics enthusiasts will appreciate. Accessories and Utility: The inclusion of color-coordinated heat shrink tubing and zip ties adds a layer of organization and professionalism to projects, enhancing the overall utility of the kit. While the wire stripper may not impress seasoned users, it's a valuable addition for those just starting, offering an all-in-one solution to basic wiring needs. Packaging and Design: The kit's packaging is notably well-conceived, featuring a box with holes for each wire spool, facilitating easy access and storage. This system helps maintain a clean and organized workspace, a boon for any project. However, the opportunity for improvement lies in the visibility of the remaining wire on each spool; a clear plastic window on the box would have perfectly rounded out the design by allowing users to gauge their wire stock at a glance. Conclusion: In summary, the 18 Gauge Wire Kit earns a solid five-star rating not through groundbreaking innovation but through the thoughtful assembly of high-quality components tailored to meet the needs of both novice and experienced electronics enthusiasts. It stands out as a comprehensive and practical kit, perfect for anyone looking to embark on or expand their electronics projects with a reliable selection of wires and tools at their disposal."

      "Includes wire stripper/cutter|||B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★☆ [2024-04-07] <b>Nice Variety in this kit for DIY projects</b> I got this kit for all the little wiring jobs around the house -- repairing things, wiring trailer lights, putting up LED lights, etc. This kit is a nice little kit with lots of variety to get different, small jobs done. I tested the wire's resistance and per the American Wire Gauge (AWG) Table, I should get 6.4 ohms resistance per 1000 feet of 18 gauge wire. I don't have a multimeter sensitive enough to measure just 23 feet of wire as in this kit, but my multimeter was bouncing between .1 and .2 ohms. Right in the ballpark of .14 ohms for 23 feet that I calculate I should have. Sorry I didn't have enough hands to measure the wire and get a picture too. I also held the wire over a flame for several seconds. The insulation stood up just fine without and visible damage to the wire. The wire itself is very flexible and I like the silicone insulation. I didn't think too much of the little wire stripper/cutter included in the kit. But, it will work if you don't already have proper tools. The little zip ties are handy, but so few won't last too long! One more thing is I thought the kit is a little spendy for what you get. But, if you need several colors of wire, but not much of it, this may work for you. Better than buying several larger rolls that you don't end up using most of. Overall, a solid product that I can recommend, given the above comments. In my book, a solid 4 star product, very useful and a quality product. But, nothing too special.

      "Wire strippers|||B0C9Y86CZM ★★★★☆ [2023-02-11] <b>Good kit. Lots of good stuff included.</b> It is a pretty cool kit. The crimper is top-notch. The strippers are not, but they are adequate for occasional use. The screwdriver is generic, and the gloves are better for making snowballs than they will be in performing electrical tasks while wearing them. The highlight of the kit, aside from the crimper (which really is a good one) is the collection of parts included - and the modular case in which it comes. The heat shrink connectors are terrific. They are color coded for size, which will correspond with a color dot on your crimper for proper crimping. They can be hit with a heat gun to provide a better seal, but they work fine with just a crimp if you don't need the additional seal. The various wire connectors are most excellent. They are the modern-day wire nut......of course I am old-school and still like to use wire nuts and I am surprised this kit does not come with any. The T-tap splices are handy to have on hand, as are the heat shrink tubing sections. You can never have too many zip-ties, but they seem to be included in this kit just to increase the \"piece count\". I think it should have been some wire nuts instead of zip-ties....but I can just swap out the bins with my own supply. Bottom line: The bottom line is, it's a helluva nice kit to have on hand, and the modular case is awesome, but I think $90 is a bit high on price point unless you don't already own a good crimper, considering the crimper alone is worth about $25.....but the whole thing is still priced on the high side I'd say.",

      "Wire ties included|||B0D2NZY48M ★★★★☆ [2024-04-02] <b>Nice assortment of wire for electronics bench work; don't go by current rating provided, though</b> I'm a hobbyist maker who creates and repairs electronics, including microcontroller and IoT projects. Having an assortment of wire on hand helps ensure I'm using the right wire for the job both in function and appearance (color coding). This assortment includes 8 spools of silicone insulated 18AWG wire in different colors, along with heatshrink tubing and wire ties in matching colors which is a nice touch for neater, more professional looking wiring jobs. The spools are included in a box with holes to allow for dispensing, but the spools lay flat in the box -- not on edge like other boxes of dispensable wire I have. This isn't really an issue, just an odd choice and it makes the box a bit wider and flatter compared to a vertical orientation. Also included is a very basic wire stripper, though I don't use it as I have more capable wire strippers at hand. I would tend to challenge the specs/rating sheet included. Generally I wouldn't suggest anywhere near 22A be run through 18AWG wire. More like half that, tops. While the silicone insultation will help reduce the chance of fire from an over current situation compared to PVC or other materials, it will still get very hot and is a grossly inefficient application of power, with so much energy being lost as heat due to the resistance of the wire. Further, seeing the recommendation here could lead the inexperienced to conclude that's a safe current for any similarly sized wire. Otherwise, I'm quite satisfied with this product.",

The wires can be pulled apart very easily, without any fear of exposing copper, for applications where you don’t need three or where the wires terminate in different places. My only caution is to double check the gauge requirement for your application. These are very thin wires. They’re supposed to be that thin, but if you’re not well acquainted with electrical hardware, you might accidentally order these for the wrong application. Know up front how much current you’ll be running (and how far) so that you don’t burn something down. In my application, I was mostly wiring LEDs, which draw a tiny current.",

I only have two issues with this and would probbaly have dinged a 1/2 star if that was an option: I measured one of the rolls to see if I was getting 20ft, and it came up about 4 inches short. This isn't too bad for 20ft, but I expect to get every inch I paid for. Now maybe some of the other rolls were longer, but I didn't verify. If that is the case then they need to be more consistant. The second issue involves using the box as a \"dispenser\". THere are holes in the back of the box to feed the wire. The problem is if you put all 6 spools in side by side, then there isn't enough room to close the lid or for the spools to spin. They came packed with the spools in a 2x3 configuration instead of the 1x6 configuration you would use for dispensing. This is because they don't fit otherwise. Looks like good wire. So if you dn't mind being shorted a couple of inches, and don't need the dispenser to work well with 6 rolls of wire, and otherwise this is a good value for you, then this is your product.

      "Zip ties|||B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ [2024-03-10] <b>Good variety kit, high quality wire</b> I ordered this wire to use with DIY electronics projects as well as wiring accessory devices in my electric bike. The main reason why I chose this wire over cheaper wire variety packs is because this wire has silicone insulation which is more durable, flexible, and heat resistant than conventional wire insulation. The silicone insulation did not disappoint. You can see in the video I attached that the insulation is quite resistant to heat and does not melt as easily. Notice the reaction of the bare wire to heat in the video as well. The wire is indeed tinned and when you heat it, the tinning material evaporates and the bare copper wire is left underneath. This is something you should take into consideration when connecting these wires to a terminal since the tinning should be removed in order to get a solid connection. Probably a regular lighter is more suited to this task than a blow torch. Overall I am very satisfied with this wire kit. The wire is all very high quality and perfect for automotive applications due to the heat and wear resistance of the silicone insulation. This kit also comes with a wire stripper, some zip ties, and heat shrink. I could care less about these extras but it might be a nice perk if you don't have these items already. I would highly recommend this kit if you need a variety of different colored wires for an automotive project. The silicone insulation is the best you can get.",

I'm have not used wire with thus type of shielding before so I was skeptical. I opened one spool and put it to the test. I knew that tinned wire was easier to solder and offered less resistance and works great for wiring projects. What I didn't know was the silicone covering. After opening the spool I found the covering to be very flexible. It was more maneuverable the other wire I had worked with. It kind of felt like plastic and rubber blended together. It claimed it would withstand high heat and extreme cold. I used my lighter and it took a long time to melt the silicone. I then put the wire in the freezer and after freezing it was still very pliable. This set also came with different colored zip ties so if you need to keep different wires together in a group going to one place these come in handy.

      "Colored zip ties|||B0C7T9YK2N ★★★☆☆ [2023-10-14] <b>Fine wire, but a little skimpy on the amount, with poorly thought out dispenser</b> First; just as an admission, I usually work on low-power circuits and use much thinner wire (22 gauge or above). However, it's good to have some thicker wire around for those times you have to move a lot of current, so I ordered the 18-gauge silicone wire. As for the wire itself, it seems high quality, with decent insulation. It's pre-tinned, which supposedly makes it easier to solder, though I didn't notice a huge difference (see video). It's nice that it comes with some heat-shrink in the same colors, for those times when you can't hide your wires from view. It even comes with colored zip ties, though I see less of a use for these. On the downside, the spools aren't that full; it's only 10 ft of wire, which frankly isn't that much. It'd be much more useful if they filled the spools. Like other wire assortments, the box this comes in doubles as a dispenser. However, it's kind of a disaster. Instead of aligning the spools vertically side by side, they lay the spools flat, with the wires coming out both sides. It's a little hard to explain the geometry of it all, but the spools get jumbled up much more easily, the box doesn't stay closed as firmly, and it's a pain to respool the wire if you've accidentally pulled out too much. There's a reason practically every wire assortment puts the spools side-by-side; it just plain works better. So while this is fine wire, i'd really recommend looking for a kit with a decent dispenser and more than 10ft per spool.",

The bags of zip ties and heat-shrink tubing include zip ties and heat-shrink tubing that match the colors of the wires with the exception of black zip ties. The kit I received did not include any black zip ties but those are easy to find elsewhere. The wire features silicone insulation and is very flexible. The insulation is soft enough that it can be easily stripped by simply pinching and pulling on the insulation. This makes the wire easy to work with but causes some concern for how easy the wire could be damaged. The box features holes that make it easy to pull the wires out of the box while keeping the spools contained in the box. The included wire stripper is very simple but a good addition to the kit.

My methodology for Vine Program products is to give a more thorough -- often product-destructive -- review. If I like the product, I buy my own version of it, otherwise, it gets donated post-testing. I also may include my opinion on the product's value proposition to the market. REVIEW: -------------------------------- If I was to give a description that people might be able to reference, I'd say this feels like the power cord you'd find on a high-end power tool. It's thick, and doesn't have a strong odor (common in cheaper products). Each comes with some zipties and a few pieces of heat-shrink if you need it. Inspection of the individual wires does seem to indicate tinned copper (instead of tinned aluminum), but I'd need a better device to really tell. At slightly over ~$1/ft, it's not a bad deal if you just need it in a pinch for a project. END NOTE: -------------------------------- And with all the reviews I do, if there's ever a problem with this product, I will edit (if able) to update this review. These will be denoted in an \"UPDATES\" section.",
      "Includes zip ties|||B0CN2RB68V ★★★★★ [2023-12-24] <b>Very flexible wire, dispenser not as pictured</b> I use a lot of wire for various DIY projects and electronic repair. I really liked the dispenser shown in the product photos and video and, to be completely honest, I ordered this wire at least considering it supposedly came with the nifty dispenser box. The \"dispenser\" box has 3 holes on each side, ostensibly to allow you to pull the wire from the box. However, the box is so tight, you can barely get it to close, so, when closed, it does not allow the individual spools to move freely at all. At best, when you pull one strand, the spool next to it also moves to some extent. The wire itself appears to be fantastic - very supple and super flexible. The silicone insulation is on the thick side, so any sharp bends or small nicks probably won't have a big impact on the stranded wire within. The also include some matching zip-ties and (what I am assuming is) heat-shrink tubing. Since the review is for the wire itself, I won't take any stars for the disappointing \"dispenser\" box because the wire is actually really nice.",

The set also includes some zipties to help with any wire management needs and some heatshrink tubing for after your strip the wire jackets or solder. The core is tinned copper which looks to be good quality so conduction and signal stability shouldn't be a problem. I'd like to see more size options, but this set is a really good deal for what you get.",

The 18 gauge is good for smaller, low current circuits. I really like that the box itself is a dispenser, that way I won't have to worry about keeping track of all the spools and worrying about them unwinding themselves while being moved around in a drawer or something. The wire itself is aluminum, so not the highest quality, but it only needs to carry a little power, I wouldn't use this for signal wire that can't tolerate noise (speakers, sensitive control circuits, etc.). The insulation is rubberized and very flexible. It makes it a little more difficult to strip, but will protect it better from sharp edges so it's worth it. The included color matched shrink tubing and zip ties are a good touch too.",
      "Includes zip ties|||B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ [2024-01-27] <b>Very easy to work with</b> I am using this stranded PVC wire for a couple of LED lighting projects. It is rated for up to 600V but I'm only using 24 volts. The wiring gauge is 16 gauge. For my indoor LED application, this is a thicker gauge than I need. The main downside is that the cable is about 1/2\" in diameter. That is a bit thick for some places I have to run it. The wire can be bent around a very tight turn radius without breaking or damaging some of the strands. The wire comes with some zip ties, heat shrink tubs and band to keep the wire from unspooling. This wire does work out well for some application. It would work great with outdoor landscape lighting if need 6 separate conductors. Each strand is clearly color coded so that makes this easier to work with. Overall, I'm very pleased with this wiring. It is reasonably priced and easy to work with.",

The wire also comes with a package containing some short pieces of heat shrink tubing as well as some zip ties. Highly recommend. 5 stars.",
      "Includes zip ties|||B0BWY3JGGV ★★★★★ [2023-07-09] <b>Good Wire With Extra Stuff Included</b> Here’s a case where I apparently did not read the product description thoroughly. The wire comes with small zip ties, a “toy” wire stripper, and heat shrink. I didn’t need any of those items. However, the wire itself is of good quality. The insulation is, shall we say, sturdy. A good, professional wire stripper is needed to bare the wires. The conductors are all individually tinned, and the wire is fairly flexible. The six different colors will help me to keep things straight when wiring between the six circuit boards on my project. Very happy with the wire. The wire stripper might work well as a letter opener.",
      "Includes zip ties|||B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ [2024-02-26] <b>Flexible silcone sheath!</b> I ordered these because I needed more flexibility than the standard plastic sheets offered. The silicone sheaths on these are great. Nicely flexible and easy to strip. The zip ties were a nice little bonus. The cardboard box they come in also serves as a dispenser. The issue I had though was that when you lined up the spools with the dispensing holes, they are a little wider than the inside of the box so the box does not close flush (i.e., bulging at the sides) and the spools won't spin freely. So, using the box as a dispenser was a no-go. Other than that, the wiring itself is nice quality, nice vibrant colors and again - nicely flexible.",
      "Reusable hook-and-loop cable ties|||B07TFF9FTM ★★★★★ [2023-07-24] <b>Surprisingly great</b> I am astounded at the high quality of the wire that I have in my hand given the low price that I paid for it. The gauge appears accurate; the insulation seems to be high quality and is not overly stiff; the wire is easy to strip. Other little things I like: The wire spools have holes on the sides, rather than through the spindle, making it much easier to use them to prevent a full-ish spool from unraveling. The spools arrived wrapped in reusable hook-and-loop cable ties rather than the more typical, annoying to open plastic shrink wrap. The cardboard dispenser box is actually sturdy, and the holes are well-placed and the right size for the wire. It will absolutely be a good long-term storage solution for the wire. It would be hard to be less than impressed with this product. When it comes to basic breadboard-compatible hookup wire, this one appears to be the one to buy.",
      "Velcro tie included|||B0CGQ29J9Q ★★★★★ [2023-04-05] <b>Wow</b> This is really good premium wire. UL rating gives a peace of mind especially for critical applications. Insulation is really soft, and doesn't easily kink and hold memory like cheaper wire. Additional premium touches - you would think how many \"features\" could a cable have, yet here we are: 1. Rubber cable end caps, which I assume are meant to protect the cut copper ends from oxidizing over long periods of storage. 2. A velcro tie. 3. Low odor. At least compared to some cheaper wire, which can instantly stink up my entire room. Last but not least, this cable is made in Korea by a company that is itself compliant to very strict standards. So personally I automatically expect higher quality compared to a certain other country where most cables are made, and by every indication this meets those expectations. Highly recommended if you can afford the premium, and/or need it for critical applications that need to be standard compliant.",
      "Comes with bonus zip ties|||B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ [2024-02-16] <b>Practical kit for small wiring jobs</b> This is a convenient set of wire for small automotive or hobby projects. The wire is tinned copper, and I exposed the copper with a grinder to be sure of the copper. The tinning makes the actual wire appear silver and protects against corrosion. Very flexible and finely stranded, so it is easy to pull and route where needed and various colors for identification according to your needs. 14 gauge is typical for 15 amps or less in relatively short distances like a vehicle, and the silicone insulation is both durable and well suited for applications where moisture, oils or dirt may be encountered. Also comes with an assortment of wire ties. Note that this is not manufactured or or suitable for use in house wiring, nor is it UL Listed. Overall, a nice selection of quality wire at a reasonable price.",

The stripping tool is kinda cheap but it works. Overall, this is a great starter set for anyone just needing to do small electronics projects.",
      "Includes zip ties|||B0D2NZY48M ★★★★★ [2024-03-22] <b>Nice wire</b> I can always locally find red and black wires, if I'm lucky, I can also find green. However, vehicle wiring comes in many many more colours. This kit is just what I needed. The box itself acts as a dispenser for the wires so you can keep every colour organised on its spool without it unwinding on you. My only issue with this design is, with the wire inside the box, you can't see how much you have left. With some colours, 16ft goes quickly. I absolutely enjoy the colour matching zip ties and heat shrink. I hate putting black heat shrink on coloured wire. Drives me crazy. When I first opened the box, I laughed at the wire stripper. I was going to bash it, but honestly, it's not bad. Works better and safer than me pushing wire between my thumb and pocket knife blade. The wire I show in the picture was stripped using the wire strippers provided. There are four different sized slots on the strippers for four different sized wires, but they aren't labelled, so be sure to double check before cutting in. The insulation on the wire is thick and flexible. The wire itself is flexible as well. I haven't noticed any issues quality control.",
      "Includes cable ties|||B0B15DXZHJ ★★★★★ [2024-02-19] <b>Excellant Product</b> Wire itself is nice enough. The dispenser box is GREAT. Additional items (heat-shrink tubing and cable ties) are very useful.",
      "Includes zip ties|||B0C7T9YK2N ★★★☆☆ [2023-10-14] <b>Fine wire, but a little skimpy on the amount, with poorly thought out dispenser</b> First; just as an admission, I usually work on low-power circuits and use much thinner wire (22 gauge or above). However, it's good to have some thicker wire around for those times you have to move a lot of current, so I ordered the 18-gauge silicone wire. As for the wire itself, it seems high quality, with decent insulation. It's pre-tinned, which supposedly makes it easier to solder, though I didn't notice a huge difference (see video). It's nice that it comes with some heat-shrink in the same colors, for those times when you can't hide your wires from view. It even comes with colored zip ties, though I see less of a use for these. On the downside, the spools aren't that full; it's only 10 ft of wire, which frankly isn't that much. It'd be much more useful if they filled the spools. Like other wire assortments, the box this comes in doubles as a dispenser. However, it's kind of a disaster. Instead of aligning the spools vertically side by side, they lay the spools flat, with the wires coming out both sides. It's a little hard to explain the geometry of it all, but the spools get jumbled up much more easily, the box doesn't stay closed as firmly, and it's a pain to respool the wire if you've accidentally pulled out too much. There's a reason practically every wire assortment puts the spools side-by-side; it just plain works better. So while this is fine wire, i'd really recommend looking for a kit with a decent dispenser and more than 10ft per spool.",
      "Included zip-ties|||B0CL75YXB3 ★★★★★ [2024-05-02] <b>Helpful purchase</b> The 6-wire cable was exactly what I needed. They even thru-in some useful heat-shrink and wire-ties to aid with mounting and terminating.",
      "Included zip ties|||B0CGH6VSMX ★★★★★ [2023-09-09] <b>Outstanding value!</b> This cable is an outstanding value! Between the 4 conductors in the cable, you get 400ft of wire for $50 right now. Naoevo also included a whole whack of zip ties and heat shrink tubing which is an excellent inclusion to help with your wire install. The outer layer is a kind of thin rubber or plastic sheathing. It doesn't feel super strong, but it'll keep your wires organised over long runs. It'll also look better than 4 loose wires. The wires themselves are true 18 gauge and helpfully color coated to ensure you get your connections in the right place. The outer sheathing is a little bit annoying to strip away since it's so stretchy, but if you cut it vertically with your wire cutters, then clip off the verticle strips, you can get 'er done. The individual wire insulation is easy to strip and work with though. As far as the application for this kind of wire, I used this to have a clean run from my home theater receiver out to my rear channel speakers. Keeps the four wires nice and clean for the long main cable run, then you can strip back the outer sheathing where you need to connect the speakers themselves. This would also be excellent for car applications. This stiffer wire is easier to push through the car interior than single floppy wires are. All in all, as said at the start, this is a great value for all that wire and the included install gear. If you need versitile wire at a great price, this is for you!",

Copper is expensive, but it is what it is. As for quality, it seems great. I only needed around 20' of 18AWG for a project with LED strips I needed to make independently dimmable. I ended up receiving almost 23', so I'm a very happy camper! The insulator is great. It's flexible and the cable is over 6mm. I appreciate the end caps and the velcro strap, nice touch.",

I myself got the kit because although I have lots of wire in my workshop, most of it is \"reused\" wire from otherwise discarded items, and I don't really have an assortment of colors available to color-code different circuits (which gives a nice neat appearance plus makes it easier to understand the function of different circuits if/when maintenance on them is required up the road). There are a total of eight different colors in this kit, which includes the commonly-used red, black, green, white and yellow. The quality of the wire is really good, with soft and very flexible insulation that's easy to strip, and tinned copper that won't tarnish and potentially cause issues in the future when being soldered. There are some nice bonuses included in the package as well, which although they are mentioned in the product ad I somehow failed to notice until the box arrived and I had a nice surprise. These is a selection of heat shrink tubing and plastic wire ties that match each of the 8 colors of wire. Also included is a little stripping tool. Although I already have a few wire strippers of various designs, I wanted to try the included one to see how it worked, and was pleased with the results - it stripped the insulation from the wire without cutting through any of the conductors. Very nice!",

Do not buy it for data transfer, this is a charging cable. As described it is \"only\" usb 2.0 (data transfer rate). It can however do fast charging up to 100W which is more than enough for any phone (my new Pixel has a 30W charger), and most laptops.

Is seems to be. Does it work to conduct electricity? Yes. So I guess that's what you want from wire. According to the box, this wire is made of tinned copper, as opposed to bare copper. My understanding is that \"tinned copper\" (with a thin coating of tin around a copper wire) helps with resistance to oxidation, and is especially beneficial in high-moisture environments. This kit comes with a bag of small zip ties and a bag of heat-shrink tubing (looks like about 25 of each), as well as a small wire stripper, which is appreciated. So far, this wire is working well, and I am happy with this item."

I tested the wire's resistance and per the American Wire Gauge (AWG) Table, I should get 6.4 ohms resistance per 1000 feet of 18 gauge wire. I don't have a multimeter sensitive enough to measure just 23 feet of wire as in this kit, but my multimeter was bouncing between .1 and .2 ohms. Right in the ballpark of .14 ohms for 23 feet that I calculate I should have. Sorry I didn't have enough hands to measure the wire and get a picture too. I also held the wire over a flame for several seconds. The insulation stood up just fine without and visible damage to the wire. The wire itself is very flexible and I like the silicone insulation. I didn't think too much of the little wire stripper/cutter included in the kit. But, it will work if you don't already have proper tools. The little zip ties are handy, but so few won't last too long! One more thing is I thought the kit is a little spendy for what you get. But, if you need several colors of wire, but not much of it, this may work for you. Better than buying several larger rolls that you don't end up using most of. Overall, a solid product that I can recommend, given the above comments. In my book, a solid 4 star product, very useful and a quality product. But, nothing too special.

Also, nice extras, the colored heat shrinking tubes and also colored tiny wire ties are of good quality, too. The basic wire stripper may come handy in a hurry. The box is meant to work as a dispenser, though it is pretty crowded with the eight spools packed together in two rows and pulling from a spool may engage its neighbors in winding back their wire endings.",

As an Engineer, the only thing that stands out to me as incortrect in the description is the 36 amp rating. That isn't right - or safe. Yes, it may carry 36 amps for a while but it's going to get real hot and at some point fail or start a fire - silicone jacket or not. Here in the U.S. Code requires the use of 10 gauge wire for 30 amps. Any load on this 12 gauge wire that exceeded 20-22 amps would fail inspection. Keep that in mind when using this.

      "Comes in a nice box|||B07GH7JHG9 ★☆☆☆☆ [2023-02-09] <b>This cable is comprised of copper clad aluminum wire</b> First the pros: The cable comes in a nice box and the cable feeds out of this box without tangles. The outer black sheath is smooth and feeds well through conduit without lubrication. The product is priced very well if you think you are buying top quality copper conductor cable. The cons: This is really lousy cable. The conductors are supposed to be 23 AWG but the box I received measured below 24 AWG. The individual wires are brittle and break easily. So easily in fact that it was almost impossible to terminate in an RJ-45 plug. After spending hours placing this cable through walls and attic space, testing revealed there was a break somewhere along the cable. Makes perfect sense. Just manipulating the twisted pair to straighten for termination would cause at least one of the eight conductors to snap off. I have terminated lots of twisted pair cable and this was by far the most difficult to work with. Also, the product title does not indicate this is copper coated aluminum (CCA) cable wire.",

I use it for Arduino projects at home and this is perfect for that. 22 AWG wire has a rated current limit of <1 Amp, which should be fine for most low power applications.

I unwrapped the shrink wrap from the outside, opened the box, poked out the perforated holes and fed the wiring through. It could not have been easier! So far, this has been great quality wiring. It strips easily, tins well, and the silicone handles heat very well during soldering, resulting in no melted insulation.

The box serves as a dispenser that actually works because the wire is too soft to try to withdraw back into the exit holes as is often the case with PVC-insulated wire. There is some chemical odor coming from the insulation, or at least coming out of the box.

      "Cardboard protection|||B0C9H1G52F ★★★★★ [2023-10-10] <b>Works well - Good value</b> All copper products have gotten to noise-bleed pricing of late. Even running low voltage wire is just ridiculously expensive especially if you run to one of the home stores. Ad frankly , if you're ordering wire without knowing what it is or seeing/feeling it, it can be a little scary as the quality varies so much. This wire arrives on a wooden core. Okay - that makes 500ft of heavy a little heavier, but you know they care about their product. It's also probably the only way to ship it so it doesn't end up as a bundle of knotted wire when it arrives in your standard Amazon box which in my case was shipped through UPS and clearly had a tough ride. But 500 feet of wire is pretty heavy at about 22 lbs on a 10x10-ish core. And the wire made it fine with a nice sheet of cardboard wrapped around the wire in between the core ends. The box clearly won over whichever UPS employee was fighting with it. The wire just feels like quality. It''s a firm, yet flexible outer sheath holding the two separate strands of 16 gauge wire. The sheath is UV resistant and rated for direct burial. It's UL listed and RoHS rated. It seems like a quality product and for purposes it's great. My use case is extending an existing low voltage run along the side of the property of the house to the back and introducing low voltage lights to the back yard. In southern Florida, the groundwater is high, the weather humid, and the sun hot. What better test ground for this? Anyhow it's ultimately gonna be buried under landscape rocks yet above landscape fabric in most places. Others will be direct burial In certain spots known for puddling. I expect no issues given the quality of this wire. And at 16Awg I expect it to be able to carry the 12 volts I need without concern. Highly recommend.",

The silicone jacket is immune to soldering temperatures with no melting or creep from the heat. The solid copper strands are tinned to prevent oxidation and to ease soldering. Working with high-flexibility and heat-resistant silicone wire is a treat compared to PVC-insulated wire, but the higher cost usually makes me limit its use to special projects where there is a great deal of repetitive flexing or where it is necessary to ensure that no stresses are imposed on the joint, such as when soldering to the pads of a circuit board. I would prefer to use silicone wire for everything otherwise. You can punch holes in the cardboard box and use it as a wire dispenser. At $6 per 50ft spool for 20 gauge wire this seems like a very good value, especially compared to hobby shop prices where you can pay that much for a couple 3ft lengths. Highly recommended.",

The wire quality is pretty good and a lot of strands instead of just a few big strands or just a few strands at all. The wire is also really flexible and easy to manipulate to where you need it.

There are small holes on both sides where you can feed the wires through to act as dispensers. One side is under the lid, so the wire ends are held under the lid when not in use. The other side is opposite so you can keep the lid closed and be able to pull wire out. It also comes with a small pack of heat shrink tubing in the same colors as the wires. I'm pleased with this set. It's not a massive amount of wire, but gives me some options for wire colors to help me keep my circuits straight.",
      "Box serves as dispenser|||B0C6K5T8BW ★★★★★ [2024-05-01] <b>Solid to the core! Great for soldering and breadboarding</b> These are great wires for electronics hobby projects. As they are tinned, they are easy to solder, and the single core and size (22 gauge) makes them firm enough to use in breadboards. Six colors and 30 ft per color is a good quantity. The box serves as a convenient dispenser. I liked them so much, I quickly ordered another box.",
      "Comes in cardboard box|||B0CMLHV3FX ★★★★★ [2024-02-26] <b>Flexible silcone sheath!</b> I ordered these because I needed more flexibility than the standard plastic sheets offered. The silicone sheaths on these are great. Nicely flexible and easy to strip. The zip ties were a nice little bonus. The cardboard box they come in also serves as a dispenser. The issue I had though was that when you lined up the spools with the dispensing holes, they are a little wider than the inside of the box so the box does not close flush (i.e., bulging at the sides) and the spools won't spin freely. So, using the box as a dispenser was a no-go. Other than that, the wiring itself is nice quality, nice vibrant colors and again - nicely flexible.",

      "Comes in its own protective box|||B0C7T9YK2N ★★★★☆ [2023-09-23] <b>Good wire</b> This wire set arrived in excellent condition. It comes in its own protective box that has provisions for distributing the wire through holes on the sides --handy for keeping the spools protected and in order. If you do any electronics prototyping you know that spools of finer gauge wire, like these, can be indispensable. This wire lives up to my expectations for this kind of use: the tinned copper wires are in good order, and the sheathing is of good thickness, but pliable. It strips and cuts well (but not with the provided stripper, which doesn't have a small enough cutting hole to cut or strip this wire.) Tinned copper wire has its uses especially in environments that are higher humidity or higher heat than recommended for copper alone. That's useful. To ensure the wires are indeed tinned copper, I lightly sanded a stripped end of one until the copper started to emerge. You can see in my attached photo that under the tinning there is indeed copper wire. I prefer boxes where the spools are all lined up on one dowel and the wires all come out the same side of the box. With this box three come out one side and three come out the other. That's not as handy for a compact setup. So the wire is fine. The box and cutter/stripper are not up to my standards, but they can be easily replaced. In the end it's the wire that matters.",

Thx to Sebastien from Canada for that hot tip All in all, a great product.

The gauge appears accurate; the insulation seems to be high quality and is not overly stiff; the wire is easy to strip.

The spools arrived wrapped in reusable hook-and-loop cable ties rather than the more typical, annoying to open plastic shrink wrap. The cardboard dispenser box is actually sturdy, and the holes are well-placed and the right size for the wire. It will absolutely be a good long-term storage solution for the wire.

I used a big rubber band over the front to hold the wires down once they feed through and that seems to help, except for the orange one which unwound everywhere. Otherwise, this is good wire.

The eight little spools of wire Come in A box with eight holes around the edges that theoretically would allow you to dispense the wire without opening the box. The box is designed so that the spools lay on their sides. Four wires come out of each side. This means you can't leave the box on the shelf and just pull out the wire you want.

I expected that there would be a good assortment of wire terminal and connector ends, but suspected they might be somewhat on the cheaper end, with plastic insulation that cracks when crimped, or terminals that bend or distort easily. I also anticipated that I would use my own wire strippers and crimpers because the ones provided in these kind of kits aren't usually all that good or last very long. Let me say that this kit rises far above all those negative expectations. The ratcheting crimper is solid, and the crimps for each size wire are precise, neither over-crimping and crushing the terminal or leaving the wire loose so it pulls out of the terminal. The wire strippers are sharp and are among some of the better ones I have used in this style. Yes, it also comes with a screwdriver, in the event you need that in your electrical endeavors. The case is a bit of a weak link, as it would not last long with the occasional drop off of a fender or ladder. It is a very convenient storage case, with good division of areas for the different terminals and connectors. This will be my go-to electrical kit moving forward, simply because of the quality of the tools and the variety of terminals and connectors.",
      "Box doubles as dispenser|||B0C7T9YK2N ★★★☆☆ [2023-10-14] <b>Fine wire, but a little skimpy on the amount, with poorly thought out dispenser</b> First; just as an admission, I usually work on low-power circuits and use much thinner wire (22 gauge or above). However, it's good to have some thicker wire around for those times you have to move a lot of current, so I ordered the 18-gauge silicone wire. As for the wire itself, it seems high quality, with decent insulation. It's pre-tinned, which supposedly makes it easier to solder, though I didn't notice a huge difference (see video). It's nice that it comes with some heat-shrink in the same colors, for those times when you can't hide your wires from view. It even comes with colored zip ties, though I see less of a use for these. On the downside, the spools aren't that full; it's only 10 ft of wire, which frankly isn't that much. It'd be much more useful if they filled the spools. Like other wire assortments, the box this comes in doubles as a dispenser. However, it's kind of a disaster. Instead of aligning the spools vertically side by side, they lay the spools flat, with the wires coming out both sides. It's a little hard to explain the geometry of it all, but the spools get jumbled up much more easily, the box doesn't stay closed as firmly, and it's a pain to respool the wire if you've accidentally pulled out too much. There's a reason practically every wire assortment puts the spools side-by-side; it just plain works better. So while this is fine wire, i'd really recommend looking for a kit with a decent dispenser and more than 10ft per spool."

      "Comes in a box with dispenser holes|||B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★★ [2024-03-14] <b>Great wire for hobbyists</b> This wire kit makes a great kit for hobbyists who need several pieces of different colored wires in a project. This kit comes with 8 rolls of wire (brown, white, black, red, orange, blue, yellow, and green), a bag of zip ties, a bag of heat-shrink tubing, and a wire stripper. The bags of zip ties and heat-shrink tubing include zip ties and heat-shrink tubing that match the colors of the wires with the exception of black zip ties. The kit I received did not include any black zip ties but those are easy to find elsewhere. The wire features silicone insulation and is very flexible. The insulation is soft enough that it can be easily stripped by simply pinching and pulling on the insulation. This makes the wire easy to work with but causes some concern for how easy the wire could be damaged. The box features holes that make it easy to pull the wires out of the box while keeping the spools contained in the box. The included wire stripper is very simple but a good addition to the kit. Most hobbyists will prefer to use their own wire strippers, but some beginners may find the included wire stripper useful. Overall, this wire kit seems like a great kit for hobbyists who prefer a clean and organized project and workspace.",

      "Box with holes for dispensing|||B0D2NZY48M ★★★★☆ [2024-04-02] <b>Nice assortment of wire for electronics bench work; don't go by current rating provided, though</b> I'm a hobbyist maker who creates and repairs electronics, including microcontroller and IoT projects. Having an assortment of wire on hand helps ensure I'm using the right wire for the job both in function and appearance (color coding). This assortment includes 8 spools of silicone insulated 18AWG wire in different colors, along with heatshrink tubing and wire ties in matching colors which is a nice touch for neater, more professional looking wiring jobs. The spools are included in a box with holes to allow for dispensing, but the spools lay flat in the box -- not on edge like other boxes of dispensable wire I have. This isn't really an issue, just an odd choice and it makes the box a bit wider and flatter compared to a vertical orientation. Also included is a very basic wire stripper, though I don't use it as I have more capable wire strippers at hand. I would tend to challenge the specs/rating sheet included. Generally I wouldn't suggest anywhere near 22A be run through 18AWG wire. More like half that, tops. While the silicone insultation will help reduce the chance of fire from an over current situation compared to PVC or other materials, it will still get very hot and is a grossly inefficient application of power, with so much energy being lost as heat due to the resistance of the wire. Further, seeing the recommendation here could lead the inexperienced to conclude that's a safe current for any similarly sized wire. Otherwise, I'm quite satisfied with this product.",

The wire gauge size seems accurate and fits snuggly in my breadboards. Only thing I noticed is the insulation coating is a little thicker than I expected. I'm using it to do Arduino prototyping and often or run wires underneath things plugged into the breadboard and the extra thickness of the insulation tends to take up valuable space so I can't get as many wires as I used to. It's a small challenge and I may look around it other brands but overall it's a good value for the variety of colors and the fact that the wire looks like it's tinned copper. I should mention that if you're going to solder this, the insulation does look like PVC and it will melt fairly quickly, so do your soldering quickly and at lower temperatures. I use a 384° solder on a temperature adjustable weller and I haven't had an issue. If you're using a cheaper soldering iron that doesn't have real temperature control you're going to have a harder time keeping the insulation from melting",

The kit comes in a handy case, it's a decent case and about what I expected at this price. I'm planning on customizing the organizer boxes, there are some things included I won't use, and replace those with stuff I use frequently. That's one thing I really like, the case will allow me to put everything I use frequently in one place. The crimper, wire stripper, and screwdriver are medium quality, excellent for DIYers, but not a pro. The connectors are very good, like other Konbur connectors I've used. There are two pairs of gloves included, not sure I'll use those. The case has room for additional tools in the top which I'll add a multi-driver, pliers, and other assorted tools. The wire stripper is sharp and works well. The crimper works well, but doesn't crimp the smallest connectors in the set very well (I would have given 5 stars if the crimper worked better on the small connectors).

Mine came as a twisted mess that looks unprofessional and not really useable for anything more than auto speaker wire. Looks like just a haphazard cut from a much larger spool. Biggest complaint is it stinks up whatever room it is in. It is potent and I think the manufacturer knew this because it came double bagged. I thought the busted sauce that was in the Amazon box this came together in was what smelled up the box but several days later it's definitely the wire as I can smell it from 8 feet away. The price isn't bad and the copper wire itself seems ok. But the jacket used isn't useable for any code regulated work and it's only marking is the meter length interval.

I move a column speaker outside and connect it to a small PA amp. The flexible KWANGIL 16 AWG wire makes this process much easier than the stiffer 18 AWG speaker wire that I had previously been using. As an added bonus, this wire is UV stable and also tinned to protect it from corrosion. And the tinned wire is super easy to solder. KWANGIL even supplies the coil with an end cap on each wire end to keep the wire in perfect condition until it’s ready to be used. The 20 feet of wire is supplied wound in a ~7 ½ inch coil and packaged in a sealed plastic bag. Thanks to the large size of the coil, when the wire is unwrapped it lays fairly flat unlike wire that has been tightly coiled. Stripping the outer jacket was just as easy as the listing said it would be. I stripped 4 inches from one end with no problem. Stripping the individual wires on the other hand isn’t as easy. The insulation on each wire is tight but that also keeps moisture away. Stripping ½ inch took a bit of work, stripping 1 inch I found easiest to do in two ½ inch pieces.

I was just trying to round out my stock a bit as I already had some 10, 14 and 16 awg silicone wire around. I tend to order BNTechGo as I tried them once and was plenty happy with it. This stuff seems just as good as far as I can tell. My main concern was if it was real tinned copper or not so I stripped a section and scraped it with a sharp knife until I could clearly see the copper start showing through the tin. So yes, this is definitely real copper. The strands are extremely fine, which is great for flexibility but can make it tough to strip without cutting some. But that's the case with all flexible silicone wire, so no real issue there compared to other brands. These 10' sections came in just loose coils in a resealable pouch, which I guess is fine given how short they are; normally I prefer spools. All in all this wire seems just as good as other more established brands and costs less. Works for me.",

      "Properly packaged with plastic wrapping|||B0BYNNJS8B ★★★★★ [2023-11-04] <b>Good Quality, High Temp Wire</b> I work on a lot of electronics requiring 12-gauge wire and recently procured this wire for a couple of my projects. I received two rolls of wire properly packaged and each roll was protected with its own plastic wrapping. I had a couple characteristics I was interested in to make sure this wire is something I wanted to use (ok, I’m an engineer). Needs and Observations: - The wire I ordered is 12-gauge and should handle 20 amps. Published specs say it’s rated at 600 volts; however, my projects are all low voltage. I received a 30ft roll of red wire and a 30ft roll of black wire as advertised. They are silicone insulated. Silicone is a polymer material that can handle extreme temperature variations without breaking down. This insulation is rated up to 392 degrees F and down to -76 degrees F (or +200C and -60C). The 12-gauge wire has 56 individual strands of tinned copper (I’m taking their word for it!). - I wanted to make sure I could easily strip this wire with my Klein automatic wire strippers since I use them all the time. Sometimes with multi-strand wire, individual strands will be broken off as the insulation is being pulled off by the wire stripper. You don’t want this as current carrying capability is reduced. On the first piece of insulation stripped off, I lost only a single strand of wire. Later times were perfect – no loss (BTW, this is likely more a function of my wire strippers). - I also needed to be able to flow solder cleanly. The 12-gauge wire with 56 strands takes a lot of heat to solder, but the solder flowed nicely after it got hot enough. Even though I had to heat the wire longer than I expected to melt the solder; there was zero degradation of the silicone insulation – no melting or shrinking back which is very common with many insulation types. - As other reviewers have pointed out, the rubbery, flexible nature of this wire causes it to not retain a bend. Not to worry, tie wraps or cable clips will work fine to secure as needed. Conclusion: This wire meets or exceeds my needs (5-stars). The price is very reasonable. I’ll be using it to run some remote speakers in my shop as well as building several power cables to supply 13.8V at 5-20 amps for several ham radio transceivers. Hope my review is helpful.",

      "Comes as a coil in a bag|||B07H3TV5LC ★★★★★ [2020-06-17] <b>Good wire, good price</b> My first task with this wire was to make some car battery charger cables. I didn't really need the full spec of this wire, but I mostly wanted some really flexible wire because connecting a charger to a car battery is hard enough already. This is really finely stranded wire, and the silicone insulation both make it super-flexible. It may see incidental contact with engine parts, etc., so the temp rating (200 C) may be useful. I was soldering this to copper-coated steel clips, so I was really doggin' the heat to it to get a good joint, and the insulation which was butted to the terminals didn't shrink back or burn at all. So this is a really nice, super-flexible, heat-resistant cable for a great price. The two conductors separate really easily, so you'll want to put something for a stopper to keep it from \"unzipping.\" I'm going to put a silicone blob where the wires split. It ships coiled in a bag, not on a roll, but it was well packaged and shipped quickly."

And in our recent endeavor, the direct burial landscape light wire we procured became a star player. Boasting robust construction, it met our criteria both in terms of price and performance. The industrial-grade PVC insulation is a testament to its durability, ensuring longevity even in demanding outdoor conditions. As a 2-wire product, it further simplifies installations. A thoughtful touch is the distinctive design of each wire: one side is smoothly finished, while the other bears grooves, making identification a breeze during setup. However, there's one aspect where the product could be enhanced — its packaging. The wire is sheathed entirely in plastic, and accessing it requires completely removing this protective cover. This might sound like a minor quibble, but when you're deep into the intricacies of landscaping, unwrapping the wire can become a tangled chore, leading to unintended project delays. In conclusion, the landscape light wire has much going for it, and I'd consider repurchasing it for future projects.

      "Coil of about 6\" diameter, secured by two zip ties|||B0C27YYCXK ★★★★★ [2023-10-15] <b>3-conductor stranded copper 22AWG wire</b> I needed some small 3-conductor wire for a project and I think this will do nicely. It is unshielded, with PVC jacket and insulation. There is no filler (like cotton rope or talc or anything) between the jacket and the conductors, so it does retain some shape memory -- which is neither good nor bad. It is reasonably-flexible and does straighten out easily-enough, just as I anticipated from the product photos. It came in a plain plastic bag as a coil of about 6\" diameter, secured by two zip ties. For a relatively short length of wire like this, this is very good packaging: It wasn't cinched down into a tight bunch with a hundred kinks to work out, or wound onto a little spool that would impart a tight spiral twist. It will be easy to use what I need while keeping the coil from getting too messy. The jacket and conductor insulation both strip off with a level of ease that is familiar from other wires that I've used professionally. I have no way of verifying the oxygen-free claim, but the conductor strands themselves appear to be (and act like) solid copper, not copper-clad aluminum like many inexpensive wires have these days. I anticipate that it will work very well. The jacket is wheel-printed with the following text: \"AWM 2464 22AWG 80°C 300V VW-1 AWM I VW-1 A 22AWG 80°C 300V FT1 ZHENFENG\"",

It has a shiny outer jacket, it comes with two velcro straps to keep it neatly coiled, it also has a baggie full of heat-shrink tubing and tie wraps. They even took the time to strip off about 2 inches of the outer jacket on either end of the cable and then stripped the ends of each individual wire. So good job to them for recognizing that presentation matters. The outer jacket is just a sleeve, it's not bonded to the wire like many others. I doubt that this is burial grade and the listing doesn't say that it is. The listing shows 12 volts, but if you strip back enough of the outer jacket, you can see that the wire itself has 600V and 105 degrees Celsius printed on it.

This resists corrosion and will carry electricity very well. - Packaging was very good and there are 3 twist ties around the roll of wire, holding it together and keeping it neat. Twist ties are very good because they are much easier to deal with than zip ties and they are reusable. Cons: - Outer insulation is PVC, which will likely become much stiffer in cold weather, but it appears to be good quality PVC, so maybe it won't be too bad. I can't tell right now because the weather here is not cold enough now. - Clearly labeled \"Made in China\". Overall: Excellent quality product."

The home inspector we used seemed new to the business, at least that is what I'm chalking his performance up to. I am an electrician, so I know when electrical wiring is up to code and when it isn't. Unfortunately, my house is full of poor wiring, so I have been working on getting everything up to par before I need to use my generator for an emergency. The wire comes in a plastic-wrapped roll with a couple bands around it. I'm used to Romex coming in the plastic roll that you can pull out of the middle, but this wasn't as easy as that. The wire is pliable, as I would expect 14 gauge wire to be, and it stripped well. I had to pull a number of lengths through flexible conduit and it was just stiff enough to push through without a fish tape if the conduit was straight. Overall, I give this wire high marks. I did not encounter any of it that had poor craftmanship, it works great for 15A circuits, and I haven't had an issue after using about 150 feet of it. I will order more and keep it on hand.",

It's fairly thick and tough which is good, but the thickness does make it a bit less flexible than other wire of it's type I've used. It's also more rectangular than round so the flexibility suffers somewhat when trying to route it in tight spaces and makes it more difficult to use with a standard sheath cutter for round cable. The wire itself is good, the coating should help keep it from degrading over time. I would also prefer it came on a reel instead of wrapped and held with Velcro straps, but it's not a big deal. I have a bunch of reels from 3D printing filament and wound it up on one and it worked out well. So overall it's a good product for the dough.",

Wire for rear tractor lighting needs to be run along the underside where brush, sticks, briars claw away at it constantly. More than once, I have had wiring damaged or destroyed. I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications. I really like this wire, and I look forward to using it to upgrade my tractor warning lights in preparation for spring. It would be equally suitable for use on a mowers or trailers as well. I think this product will provide adequate protection for wiring in a tough environment for a long time. In fact, with good end connections, I am hopeful that it will last as long as the equipment.",

But also because most people opt for 1/0 gauge instead of 1 AWG so there are far more 1/0 stuff out there than regular 1AWG. My only reason for getting the 50 pack for 1AWG was because I got about 30ft of it for free (leftovers from another guy's project), and because the 50 pack meets the better value for amount of $/terminal without paying the price of the 100 pack. Could have went with a 10 or 25 pack, but those have far worse $/terminal. If I mess up some, I still will have about 30+ left, but it's unlikely. There are no other companies that make this specific size with this amount of quality and at an optimal $/terminal, even the chinese made ones. In fact, the worse quality chinese ones are more expensive than these that are made in the US, and I haven't seen any in 1AWG that are under $0.70/terminal and with no complaints of \"copper is too thin, so breaks easily.\" You can easily spend over 2 hours looking for some decent quality, cheap lug terminals, but this company is the only one that does it (assuming that you buy in 50/100 pack). Sometimes you come across funny reviews that buy 4/0 lugs for 4AWG cables. Heck even if you don't buy a 50/100 pack the quality of these dominate the majority of lug terminals out there.

So, it is basically as advertised ... but still, not exactly what I wanted. For bodging and wrapping electronic projects, it is better to have thinner insulation ... the jacket on this wire is exceptionally thick for the gauge. It is impossible to fish this through PCB journals without drilling them out. Still, it will be useful, as wraps nicely around posts, and seems a good value.

It may be PCV, but it strips exactly like Tefzel does and as far as I can tell it would be entirely suitable for use wire-wrapping, especially if you solder your wraps like you really should if you're confident in your schematic. This wire is less likely to tarnish than standard silver-plated wire-wrap wire. It's just the right size for data-level or small-signal connections to transistors and ICs, which move very little current and cannot overheat #30 wire.

I liked the idea of being able to spool off needed wire quickly. What arrived was a flat box with the wire spools just laying flat. Didn't affect the quality of the wire and I'm quite pleased with the silicone sleeve and solid wire core. Using on some electronic projects and the wire is a VERY good value. In shopping around this proved to be the best price around. Having it deliver in a short time was a bonus. The silicone sleeve strips easily which is important to me. The wire is sturdy, and I've not had any breakage while reasonably bending several times to fit tight spots. The very end of each spool is tinned, but not the full spool. This is to be expected and does not impact the usage in any way. I've used this on several small projects and am very happy. The silicone sleeve does not easily melt which has been an issue with other rubber and plastic-coated wires I've tried. I've used solder of course but also heat-shrink tubing where I used an open flame torch to shrink the tubing around the wire. I've not noticed any damage to the wire as I cautiously applied the direct-flame heat. (Heat gun is much better to use in this application, I just did not have mine available!)

I used it this time to add a 6-20 240v outlet at my work bench and I added an additional two 20a 120v outlets while I was putting holes in studs and adding breakers. I should note that I saw a couple reviews where people had problems with it breaking and snagging in all sorts of other issues and the solution to that is you just can’t manhandle the stuff. Romax is solid core wire so that means you need to not bend of the stuff Any more than necessary. Copper work hardens which means the more you bend it the more brittle it becomes, and then it breaks.

The jacket on this wire is at least 3x the thickness. I should have taken a picture to prove my point, but I am not exaggerating. 12awg solid core wire is pretty stiff anyways, but the added thickness of the jacket makes it even stiffer. Once again, a blessing and a curse. Thicker jacket, more protection, but it takes a bit more work to trim the jacket back.

Some bulbs have gone out due to failing electrical connectors. I tried replacing the connectors, but the insulation on the existing wire has become so hard that the prongs on the connectors just don’t penetrate correctly anymore. I ordered this to replace that hardened landscape wire. Unfortunately, the Quic Disc connectors I used previously do not work with this wire. Its insulation is slightly thinner than the original wire, and the conductors are spaced closer together. The Quic Disc prongs don’t align properly with the new conductors. If one prong hits the center of one conductor, the other prong can miss the other conductor entirely. The lights are only a few feet apart in a long flower bed, and I didn’t want to cut this wire into many short segments to use wire nuts at each light. So I tried the new Malibu Low Voltage Cable Connectors that pierce the insulation from both sides. They work perfectly, and have the advantage that the wire doesn’t have to be split apart every few feet to use an alternate piercing connector. Bottom line, this is great wire, with real copper conductors and flexible insulation that is easy to work with. It just isn't compatible with crimp connectors that expect the conductors to have the same spacing as in old 12 gauge landscape wire.",

Wire for rear tractor lighting needs to be run along the underside where brush, sticks, briars claw away at it constantly. More than once, I have had wiring damaged or destroyed. I think that may be a thing of the past with this cable. This wire appears to be of good quality- true 16 gauge, pre-tinned for corrosion resistance and easier soldering. Each of the six inner stranded copper conductors has a different color PVC insulation, and the bundle of 6 insulated conductors is protected by a heavy duty glossy black outer PVC jacket. The package also included: ten 12-inch long 1/8” zip ties; twenty-eight 1-1/2” long pieces of black heat shrink tubing; and two hook-and-loop wire wraps. While not a big deal, it was a nice little bonus. I would, however, have much preferred that the wire come on a spool for ease of use and storage. The listing claims a maximum of 600V, but since it lacks any certification markings, or even certification claims, I will be confining my use to low voltage applications. It appears to be a little stiff, especially now that everything is cold, but I expect that warming it up and rolling it out before installation will take care of that. Besides, once it is installed, the relative stiffness becomes a virtue in my application. The claimed IP68 Ingress Protection rating means that it is impervious to dirt and dust, and capable of being submerged (depth and duration depending upon the manufacturer) but certainly more than enough water protection for my intended vehicular applications. I really like this wire, and I look forward to using it to upgrade my tractor warning lights in preparation for spring. It would be equally suitable for use on a mowers or trailers as well. I think this product will provide adequate protection for wiring in a tough environment for a long time. In fact, with good end connections, I am hopeful that it will last as long as the equipment.",

      "252 individual tiny strands of tinned copper wire|||B0BWMW7F33 ★★★★★ [2023-06-19] <b>Really nice wire</b> As a DIYer and Handyman, I frequently find myself in need of various lengths of wire for projects and repairs. Since it's often useful to color code different connections, this five-color pack of 16 ga wire from Fipnot is good to have on hand. The package includes five spools of very nice quality wire with five different color insulation used. Each spool has 20 feet of wire. I really like the insulation on this wire. It's a soft silicone vs vinyl which I most often used in the past. This gives the wire great flexibility, as well as heat and abrasion resistance. The most commonly used red and black (for positive and negative DC wiring) are represented, as well as white, blue, and yellow. The wire consists of (according to the ad) 252 individual tiny strands of tinned copper wire. I didn't order this pack for any particular purpose in mind, but rather to have on hand when needed. Good to know that when the need comes up I'll have it \"in stock\" rather than having to run to a hardware store of home center!"

Its easy to strip the insulation but its not so soft that it tears or can be crushed off the wire easily - I've had silicone insulation that was just to fragile and this is perfect - The slightly tougher insulation is slightly stiffer but its a much better compromise for applications where the wiring won't be completely protected in a sleeve - even inside an enclosure, some of them are too easily damaged and this holds up well.

This is really finely stranded wire, and the silicone insulation both make it super-flexible. It may see incidental contact with engine parts, etc., so the temp rating (200 C) may be useful. I was soldering this to copper-coated steel clips, so I was really doggin' the heat to it to get a good joint, and the insulation which was butted to the terminals didn't shrink back or burn at all. So this is a really nice, super-flexible, heat-resistant cable for a great price. The two conductors separate really easily, so you'll want to put something for a stopper to keep it from \"unzipping.\" I'm going to put a silicone blob where the wires split.

      "PVC cord embedding stranded copper wires|||B0BRN8DWTL ★★★★★ [2023-03-07] <b>Beautiful appearance and high quality vintage style appliance wire</b> I was immediately struck that the cloth covering on this wire is so aesthetically pleasing. It looks and feels great to the touch; much better than the cloth covered wire from back in the day. I suspect the reason is that the modern 'cloth' contains some synthetics that weren't available 75 years ago. But this wire fits in fine with genuine vintage items, and this cloth is much more durable than the old stuff. I will be using it to rewire an old vintage lamp to get rid of the vinyl/plastic modern wire. I think it is a good choice to re-wire a valuable antique item as well. This wire is flexible but not as limp as most appliance wire. At first I thought the reason must be solid copper instead of stranded copper inside, which would be very strange. It's stranded not solid, however, and the lack of limpness is because the black-coated and white-coated copper stranded wires inside are embedded in a PVC 'cord' that is completely solid. In other words, there isn't a PVC tubing containing the 2 inner wires but rather a solid mass of PVC. Thus the whole thing is sturdier and heftier than it would be if it were a cloth covering over a PVC tubing containing 2 wires. Well done, as the resulting heft makes this wire seem substantial which adds a beautiful aesthetic to any vintage item. Once my re-wiring job is done if I learn any more I'll come back and edit this review.",

      "Stranded wire|||B01M8F9ZVX ★★★★★ [2021-05-06] <b>Works great for creating HT counterpoises.</b> I'm a ham operator and purchased this to construct HT counterpoises. My previous counterpoise was regular insulated copper wire and it became a pain keeping it straight, as to store the 19.5\" wire when not in use you wrap it around the HT. When unwrapping it the wire would retain the bends and would not hang straight down as you want. Trying to smooth it out and remove the bends was pretty much pointless, and it would want to keep curling back. Then when you stowed your HT, it would happen again when you pulled it out again and unwound it. I saw a recommendation to use silicone-insulated wire as it was much more flexible. I gave it a shot, and it is indeed much better for this purpose. The wire retains a little bit of memory when you unwind it, but a few smoothing passes of your hand down it gets it pretty straight, and it will \"loosen up\" even more over time. I get better performance out of this compared to my prior counterpoise, but that could be the result of intentionally going down a wire gauge to a thicker wire, the line staying straighter, the increased number of strands inside compared to the previous wire, the difference in connecting (soldering a wire loop versus using a terminal ring) or a combination of all four.",

The copper wire is pre-tinned and very easy to solder. I'll have to save this wire for the special high-flex applications and use the cheaper PVC elsewhere. The box serves as a dispenser that actually works because the wire is too soft to try to withdraw back into the exit holes as is often the case with PVC-insulated wire. There is some chemical odor coming from the insulation, or at least coming out of the box. I find it odd that silicone insulation would have an odor, so maybe it is coming from the spools or the cardboard. It's not a problem for me.

I've now ordered this 16 Gauge, UL 2464 Tinned Copper Stranded Wire for LED Lighting in 3 different flavors. I got the 3 wire / conductor, the 5 wire, and now the 4 wire. The 5 wire is great for LEDs with a DC dimmer (AC - hot, neutral, ground & DC positive, negative for my dimmer switch). Boom! all done 1 cable. I got this 4 wire for my third LED high bay; I already had an available ground in the rafters next to the fixture. I ran the cable down and 2 AC wires (hot to toggle switch, neutral to neutral) & 2 wires for DC dimmer. Done. The 3 wire I used for my first High Bay - I had another two wire cable for the dimmer. I had to zip-tie those two together. The wire is - nice supple / pliable PVC insulated 1/4\" outside diameter 16 gauge tinned copper. The Engineering Tool Box specs this wire at 6 amp carrying capacity up to 1000v @ 30 deg. C (86 F) ambient temperature. There is a .71 correction factor for temperatures between 41 - 45 deg. C (105 - 113 deg. F) So: 6(amps) x .71 = 4.26 4.26 amps is enough amperage for (3) 150w LED lamps. I'm using each cable for one fixture – I prefer to have the amperage up there for additions and the extra cost is minimal. I don't mind the extra cost for the marine rated tinned copper, but this company sells the same cable in the non-tinned flavor also. This is quality cable and makes for quick easy installations. I'll call that 5 Stars Thanks for Reading Tip: Don't get your crires wossed. Make a schematic – if you put AC power on the DC side your likely to fry your lamp.",
      "Stranded wire|||B0BXKLS2T4 ★★★★★ [2020-12-13] <b>Actual real copper wire, unlike many other brands, and exactly as advertised. Very pleased.</b> I've previously ordered silicone sheathed wire from suppliers like BNTechGo and others which advertise as \"stranded copper wire\", but are no such thing. They might have a single strand of copper in each wire, and the rest be aluminum, but they are certainly not predominantly copper. The wire strands look and feel nothing like solid copper. Enter Shonsin brand, who I only recently discovered. I ordered this 10AWG cable hoping that for once it might be what was actually advertised, and for once I was pleasantly surprised ! Real solid copper strands, great flexibility, wire gauge to specification, nice flexible silicone sheath that doesn't shrink back when soldering or using heatshrink with a heatgun. Exactly what it should be. The outer diameter of the 10AWG wire was a little larger than ideal for part of my project (my fault for not checking, since it's EXACTLY as they list in their description and sizing/gauge table), and since for that specific use I can get away with 12AWG electrically, I just placed an order for some of their 12AWG cable too. I'm still using the 10AWG cable where the size permits, and will just use the 12AWG for the wires that needs to pass through a small grommet. Hopefully the 12AWG wire is just as good as the 10AWG that I'm already using. Buying shorter lengths is always a little pricey, but this brand seems better quality by far than any of the other brands I've tried (and no more expensive for similar lengths)",

And in our recent endeavor, the direct burial landscape light wire we procured became a star player. Boasting robust construction, it met our criteria both in terms of price and performance. The industrial-grade PVC insulation is a testament to its durability, ensuring longevity even in demanding outdoor conditions. As a 2-wire product, it further simplifies installations. A thoughtful touch is the distinctive design of each wire: one side is smoothly finished, while the other bears grooves, making identification a breeze during setup. However, there's one aspect where the product could be enhanced — its packaging. The wire is sheathed entirely in plastic, and accessing it requires completely removing this protective cover. This might sound like a minor quibble, but when you're deep into the intricacies of landscaping, unwrapping the wire can become a tangled chore, leading to unintended project delays. In conclusion, the landscape light wire has much going for it, and I'd consider repurchasing it for future projects. But a packaging redesign is to facilitate easier unspooling and more convenient storage.",

I had a couple projects coming up that were going to need some close quarters cable bending so I broke down and bought the Bend-All. It works at least some of the time and has saved effort – but it is far from perfect. First off, it is expensive for what it is. (That was painful but it only hurts once.) It seems unnecessarily big and clunky. It does not always fit in where it needs to go. Proportions could be better if it were a steel forging instead of being machined from an aluminum block. (How many of your other wrenches are machined from aluminum?) The posts have serrations on them to help keep them from slipping on the cable. Unfortunately, as the cable is bent, it needs to slide on one of the posts. This tends to dig in and damage the insulation. I put a piece of heat shrink tubing on one of the posts which seemed to help. Having one of the posts free to rotate would probably be even better. This tool is rated for up to 350 MCM conductors. I have only used it on 4/0. For my use, having a smaller version with the posts a bit closer together would be better. It would be nice if there were small recesses machined on the sides of the square drive hole for the ball detent on the socket wrench extension to engage in order to help keep the Bend-All from falling off.

      "Round wire|||B085SV67Y2 ★★★★★ [2021-09-28] <b>Really great but I goofed...</b> This review serves 2 purposes... 1) to help anyone who's inexperienced at working with copper wire so the won't make my same mistake and... 2) to recommend Copper Wire USA for jewelry wire needs. I've ordered directly from Copper Wire USA's website before and prefer to purchase from them (either at their Amazon store or from their website) for all my bare copper wire needs and would highly recommend them to others who need bare copper wire. The 14 gauge dead soft copper round wire on a spool is good (very good quality, packaged well, speedy delivery, etc,) but due to a mistake on my part, I should've taken into consideration that even with dead soft wire, any copper wire larger than 18 gauge should be coiled. It's just so much easier to straighten. I could anneal it but that's extra work and cleaning I don't want to deal with so I should've spent the extra 3 bucks on their website for a coil with 10 extra feet of wire. Again, this was MY FAULT because I didn't want to spend $3 extra because I thought it would potentially be ok on a spool but it's much harder to straighten the kinks out. I knew better and ordered it anyway; therefore, I will keep it and use it for texturing.",

It looks like it will be extremely durable. It does make the wire bigger overall, though, if that matters for the particular use case. For me it doesn't, so I'm happy with it. I must admit I had quite a lot of trouble stripping this wire at first. Traditional strippers that have a sharpened hole certainly wouldn't work due to the two conductors inside occupying more space in one direction than another. I tried cutting them carefully with a sharp knife and ended up cutting into the inner conductors despite my care. I think the trick is to either have some nice wire strippers that have the two heads that pull apart, which mostly work, or using a sharp knife in concert with bending the wire away from the cut so it pulls itself apart when split. A dismantling tool also works fairly well, though is harder to keep as pretty. The self-adjusting stripper is the easiest way and makes a decently clean separation, but is a bit fickle at the size and stretchiness of the outer layer. I was slightly confused that the wire fit inside an 18awg ferrule, thinking they may have undersized the wire, but I tried another 16 gauge wire I had in hand and it did too. So no worries, I think.

It has the preferred characteristics of copper (low resistance and flexibility) with the corrosion resistance of tin. I have had to throw away pure copper wire from the 70s since it develops green oxidation and is a pain to clean but have yet to have to clean tinned copper before crimping or soldering. This wire has fewer strands that are larger and a heavy PVC outer coating, compared to the small strand silicon coated wire I use for RC helicopters. This makes it stiffer, easier to route, and tougher. I wouldn't hesitate to walk on this wire or pull it across metal edges that would cut silicon insulation. The larger strands are also better for crimping since smaller strands are more likely to break at the crimp. The only negative is the large outer diameter will limit the number of runs you can have in small spaces. Excellent wire! Recommended!",

      "Clear adhesive strip|||B079NXCN6B ★☆☆☆☆ [2020-04-17] <b>Started peeling off in less than a day</b> It doesn't stay stuck to my wall. I followed the instructions and watched the video beforehand. I wiped the wall with a damp microfiber to remove any dust and let it dry. I then applied the Ghost Wire starting at one end, peeling about a foot of the backing off at a time, smoothing it and rubbing it to the wall. Working the wrinkles out as I went along. Within one day, both ends of the run had about 6 inches peeling off the wall. Three days later, and both ends are now peeled off about 2 feet. Every morning I've tried to rub it back to the wall. My walls do have a very slight orange peel texture. Perhaps on a smooth finish the Ghost Wire would adhere better. I have not attempted to paint over it yet (and likely won't since it doesn't stay on). The total length of my application was 11.5 feet. Beyond the issue of it not remaining adhered, there were a couple other issues as well. First, there's about 1/8 of clear adhesive which is not covered by the white surface material running down the entire length of the roll. This is very visible (and sticky feeling). I was hoping that I could spray some wall texture over it since paint will likely not cover it correctly. I also snapped off my exposed ends when attaching the end connectors. Since the copper is very thin, any etching done with a razor blade to cleanly expose the copper strips weakens it to the point that any flex will shear it off. I had to peel back and use scissors, leaving a small flap rather than a nice clean transition. My Ghost Wire also was quite wrinkled from being rolled up. The manufacturer states that it's a known issue and recommends a heatgun/hairdryer to remedy so I expected that going in I liked the idea of this product. If it would have stayed on the wall, it would have been great. Even with the problems I had, I could see this working well if run under a carpet. I'm contemplating using a router to notch a shallow channel in the drywall and then just mud over the inserted wire. [update] A week later, and it's completely peeled off. Not an inch is left stuck to the wall. It's just hanging between the two connector blocks that are screwed in."

For years I have used a system where I disconnect my electric fence by hand to open my gates without getting shocked. I dug a small trench about 6\" deep under a couple of my gates and buried the RiteFENCE, and left each end protrude out of the ground about two feet to connect to one of the lower existing fence wires so as not to disconnect the continuous circuit at any time when opening gates now. I chose the 6\" depth to bury the heavily insulated RiteFENCE since in addition to moving livestock through the gates, I also drive vehicles and farm implements through the gates as well. The RiteFENCE is very sturdy and rigid, and the 12-½ gauge took some time to straighten out to fit flat and neatly into the trenches I dug and placed the wire into, but this is a definite plus for electric fence wire to be used on a farm or ranch. The RiteFENCE doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and has a thick outer coating with the inner wire apparently coated as well for the 'double insulation' aspect. When installing, I also cut back a couple of inches of the RiteFENCE on each end and used a heavy duty crimp connection to the barb wire fencing I use. Once crimped, I neatly wrapped the connections with quality electrical tape to seal from the elements. The RiteFENCE is going to be ideal for many other underground connection needs I have around the farm. I would highly recommend any farmers and ranchers who run electric fence to give the RiteFENCE a try if you want to eliminate the risk of a nasty shock, especially with the higher powered fence chargers. The price point seems very fair and in fact is actually a little cheaper than what I saw at my local farm supply store. Highly recommend!",

Standard tension guards also fit on the wire but once again, barely. My gripe is that there are defects on the individual wire sheathing (mostly green stripe). It’s bubbled and extra thick in places so if you accidentally find a piece like that, you lose 1 inch to 1 foot recutting the wire until you find an inch or two that will push into the connector. I can’t find this wire in black locally so I’m not complaining too much but be aware it’s frustrating and probably not what you want for your 10Gbps network.

The bad: I was wondering how the supplier coiled the cable so nicely with both ends next to each other! What Is received was just a plain coil with the other end in the center. That's a bit deceiving huh. The outer cable shield is a thin wall, not a full cover and fill. -1 ⭐ The ugly: There are no markings on this cable at all. No size, no certifications, no material identification, no vendor, no voltage rating, no temperature rating. None. That really makes that cable only usable for applications below 50V and where you are ok with taking a risk. -2 ⭐⭐ Bummer.",

I'm a little concerned - the jacket is a PVC tube, not molded to the internal conductors in any way, and bears no markings - cable like this normally carries various markings indicating its flammability/flame-resistant characteristics, and so forth - but this cable bears no such markings.

Often these cables have a fully flooded jacket. There are no markings on the cable so I would stick to low voltage applications. I use mine for 12v relays and it's perfect for that. Great for general purpose use.",
      "No visible markings on the wire|||B0CQV2VQSZ ★★★★☆ [2024-03-12] <b>Great hobbyist resource for a variety of projects.</b> This collection of eight colors of 18ga wire will definitely come in handy for an upcoming LED & fiber-optic enhanced countertop project I have in mind. I have read that silicone insulation has a better flexibility and heat resistance than PVC insulation, which sounds like this silicone wire will be a good choice for my project. Although great for my type of project, I didn’t see any marking on the wire (too small?) and no listing, labeling or certifications found in the product listing. It’s not such a big deal for hobby use, but sometimes it makes a difference, mainly in other than hobby use. You probably know the rule: “When in doubt; find out!” For me, this wire will be appreciated and I am happy to have it in my shop materials. Thank you. MY RATING SYSTEM: Based on all things being “average” until I discover otherwise, with focus on accurate, not over or under ratings. Average is middle 3.0-Star not 5.0-Star. Since only full point scoring is allowed, partial scores will be rated higher if half point or more and rated lower if under half point. Rating scores may be revised at a later date if there is a reason to do so that was originally unforeseen. Thank you. 5-STAR = Much better than advertised and/or expected. Claims are realistic; ratings & certifications are appropriate and checked out where possible. Exceeds 4-STAR. “ WOW” kind of items definitely to be recommended. 4-STAR = As expected or better. Claims are realistic; ratings & certifications are appropriate and checked out where possible. Fairly priced, good quality & usability, not likely to fall apart. “KEEP & USE” items to be recommended or purchased again repeatedly as needed. 3-STAR - As expected. Claims are realistic; ratings & certifications are appropriate and checked out where possible. Items are good quality, well finished, and priced fairly however nothing stands out. Examples include mass-produced “ME-TOO” items for sale under many different names. 2-STAR = Not as good as expected. The item works, but does not quite meet specifications of 3 STAR or better as described above. “NEEDS IMPROVEMENT” 1-STAR = Far below expectation. Claims, ratings, certifications are blatantly inaccurate and/or inappropriate. Low quality possibly resulting in failure, injury or worse; poor durability. “NOT RECOMMENDED”",

      "Max 24A 450V|||B0CJ3Y1BNQ ★★★★★ [2024-01-10] <b>Easy to use, waterproof 4 wire connector</b> This review is for 4 Pin IP68 Outdoor Waterproof Electrical Wire Connector for 5-12mm Wire Diameter, (Max 24A 450V) This connector separates into five pieces for installation of the wires to be spliced/connected. There are two mid pieces that contain a rubber sleeve. Two size sleeves are provided: 5mm and 12mm. They are squeezed by tightening the end caps to form a watertight seal on the exterior wire jacket. Note that the description of 5-12mm wire size refers to this outer cable jacket. The mid pieces screw together over the center section which contains the wire splicing block. It appears that up to 16 gauge wire could be used. Each wire is placed in a ferrule and is captured by a screw that is tightened such that the wire is pushed into the ferrule body, which contains a similar screw arrangement on the other side allowing two wires to be spliced/connected. The mid pieces screw over the center section and the joint is made waterproof by an o-ring on each side. They claim IP68, which means that the connection should not be continuously kept underwater. I tested the connector under a running faucet for 5 minutes and no water got inside. It should be fine in any rainstorm. I would not place it where it could be exposed to strong streams of water, such as in a pressure washer. The rating of 24A means no more than 6A per contact. If you use this for more than 50V, I would make sure that all strands on the wire are inside the ferrule and that the wire insulation goes right up to the ferrule to minimize creapage paths for high voltage. Overall, this is a very effective and compact way of splicing wires that will be exposed to weather. These were installed on the control cables of an amateur radio antenna system. I like their design and will buy more when the need arises."

First of all, they are probably the only cable that made me say Wow just by opening the box. They are beautiful. I love the color, I love the shiny terminals, even the braided cord is attractive. This is one seriously good looking cable. But how does it work? In a word, excellent. It charged a Nintendo Switch in no time, made quick work of charging a portable battery, and has charged everything else I've thrown at it so far.

I did watch the stripping video in this listing, which makes it look easy. It is also different wire. That was three conductor, this is two I was impressed to see all of the manufacturer and importer information on the box. Regardless, I found the cable to be stiff.

I have made two EFHW 40-10 antennas from this wire, and they both work great with my Xiegu G90 running 20w. Very supple and light weight, doesn't tangle. I recommend this for anyone looking for SOTA or POTA antenna wire that takes up little space and is very light."
