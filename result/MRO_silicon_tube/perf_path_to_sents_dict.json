This hose is only 1M/3.28 ft long, so it is just long enough to run through the drag chain to the back of the work area and allow enough slack to extend across all corners.

That may not be a concern for most people, but I often end up with the tubing between my face and pillow and I found this tubing to be more firm and slightly less comfortable in that position.

The hose lays out pretty flat and the smooth silicone hose fits easily onto the hose nipple on the oil filter reservoir. The hose clamp ensures the hose stays put while in use. The length of the hose drapes straight down the engine compartment and points down into the oil pan to drain off any overflowing oil when removing the oil filter. The hose can take the hot motor oil without any issue and no worries of any puncture or rip as it drops within the engine bay with the thickness of the hose. After use, I can coil it back and rinse it out and wipe it down and store in a zip lock plastic bag for next use.",

I found that under moderate pressure, and with some gentle stretching and massaging, the kinks eventually popped back to normal appearance and literally disappeared. The entire process of installing and clearing the kinks took only a few minutes. This tubing is thin walled and very limber. It swells in diameter a bit when under pressure. I haven't measured the pressure in my application, but it can't be more the a few psi. The slight swell presents no problem for my use of it as an indoor watering hose. I am not subjecting it to faucet pressure. It is getting the output pressure of a small DC transfer pump with the pressure switch set to the minimum value. This allows me to pump dilute fertilizer directly to my plants. The five Meter length is enough to reach all of my plants and the soft flexible tubing insures that I won't do any damage as I move around with it.

I use anti-kink coils to the keep the tubing from kinking. The lifetime is so far excellent; I have systems that have used it for years without leaking, hardening, or loss of flexibility. Silicone tubing is more permeable than other elastomeric tubing so water can more readily escape as a vapor but this happens slowly and can be easily remedied by designed the cooling loop so that the water is easily replenished. I personally prefer soft tubing in PC cooling systems over hard tubing. For one thing it easier to route soft tubing. Also It is not really possible to use quick-disconnect connectors with hard tubing but quick-disconnect connectors work quite well on soft tubing loops and in particular permit much easier maintenance of the cooling system. Hard tubing can be prettier, but soft tubing is far more practical especially for or extreme environments."

The original rubber tubing on the Mute Mate works fine, but because it is fairly thin, the mutes made a little bit of noise when putting the mutes back in the holder (especially a problem if you're doing recording studio work and using mutes.) So, I got this black silicone tubing, 1/4\" (6mm) ID X 3/8\" (10mm)---which means the tubing wall is rather thick (4mm thick), thicker than most similar tubing available. I cut this 10 foot tubing into 7 pieces (since my Mute Mate has 7 mute arms to hold 7 mutes) and slid this tubing over each of the 7 arms (over the original rubber tubing--taking the end cap off of each arm first), and I still had some extra tubing left over afterwards. Now, it is so much quieter and more cushioned when I put my trumpet mutes back in the Mute Mate (Gen.7) trumpet mute holder, making an already great product even better. And, unlike regular rubber, silicone is very chemically stable, and will not react with other materials (metal, plastic, wood, etc.) that your mutes and your trumpet are made of.

It has been difficult to find the proper size and weight tubing to replace the old and hardening original tubing while getting it to fit on the plastic connectors. This tubing fit exceptionally well! It is as pliable as the OEM tubing and allows the same amount of air passage. The wall of this tubing is slightly thicker than the original tubing, which makes it a bit more firm. That may not be a concern for most people, but I often end up with the tubing between my face and pillow and I found this tubing to be more firm and slightly less comfortable in that position. But that is how I was using it. I think the quality is excellent and an exceptionally good price point. If it fits for your needs, I would say, check it out!"

This silicone material is exactly what I need after trying out other materials that don't uncoil straight and difficult to fit. The 3/8\" ID x 5/8\" OD 3.3ft silicone hose came with 2 stainless steel clamps and a perfect size fit my application of using it as a motor oil drain hose attached to the oil filter reservoir on my 2010 Toyota Tacoma truck. The hose lays out pretty flat and the smooth silicone hose fits easily onto the hose nipple on the oil filter reservoir. The hose clamp ensures the hose stays put while in use. The length of the hose drapes straight down the engine compartment and points down into the oil pan to drain off any overflowing oil when removing the oil filter. The hose can take the hot motor oil without any issue and no worries of any puncture or rip as it drops within the engine bay with the thickness of the hose. After use, I can coil it back and rinse it out and wipe it down and store in a zip lock plastic bag for next use."

The corrugated tubing has given me nothing but grief. It's hard to work with, doesn't fit well on the supplied connectors, and tends to break (split) after being exposed to the weather after a couple of months. This has resulted in some near disasters. This silicone tubing is a joy to work with. Fittings are easy to install and make a secure connection. The problem I ran into was when installed on the input side between a filter and a pump the tubing is not firm enough to prevent it from collapsing due to the suction created. It works great in a configuration where the pump is feeding an external filter, when the tubing remains under pressure.",

It's tight enough of a fit to prevent leaking, but not so tight that it's a chore to get it off. The only mod that it was impossible to use with was the Hugo Squeezer. That mod needs tubing with a 3mm ID. It was possible to get this 2mm ID tubing attached to a REO, but it was a struggle. a 3mm ID is best for that as well. The 4mm OD fits the cap hole in nearly every bottle, both \"brand name\" ones (Pulse, Lost Vape, Squeezer, DaOne and others) and the generic ones (YFTK and similar 'no name' bottles). Again, the stock Hugo Squeezer bottle was the exception. The hole in the cap is made for a 5mm OD tube. But, since there are a lot of bottles that work with this tubing and fit the Squeezer, it's not a major problem (unless you only have the Squeezer and no other bottles).

I use anti-kink coils to the keep the tubing from kinking. The lifetime is so far excellent; I have systems that have used it for years without leaking, hardening, or loss of flexibility. Silicone tubing is more permeable than other elastomeric tubing so water can more readily escape as a vapor but this happens slowly and can be easily remedied by designed the cooling loop so that the water is easily replenished. I personally prefer soft tubing in PC cooling systems over hard tubing. For one thing it easier to route soft tubing. Also It is not really possible to use quick-disconnect connectors with hard tubing but quick-disconnect connectors work quite well on soft tubing loops and in particular permit much easier maintenance of the cooling system. Hard tubing can be prettier, but soft tubing is far more practical especially for or extreme environments.",

The corrugated tubing has given me nothing but grief. It's hard to work with, doesn't fit well on the supplied connectors, and tends to break (split) after being exposed to the weather after a couple of months. This has resulted in some near disasters. This silicone tubing is a joy to work with. Fittings are easy to install and make a secure connection. The problem I ran into was when installed on the input side between a filter and a pump the tubing is not firm enough to prevent it from collapsing due to the suction created. It works great in a configuration where the pump is feeding an external filter, when the tubing remains under pressure.",

The hose lays out pretty flat and the smooth silicone hose fits easily onto the hose nipple on the oil filter reservoir. The hose clamp ensures the hose stays put while in use. The length of the hose drapes straight down the engine compartment and points down into the oil pan to drain off any overflowing oil when removing the oil filter. The hose can take the hot motor oil without any issue and no worries of any puncture or rip as it drops within the engine bay with the thickness of the hose. After use, I can coil it back and rinse it out and wipe it down and store in a zip lock plastic bag for next use.",

I use anti-kink coils to the keep the tubing from kinking. The lifetime is so far excellent; I have systems that have used it for years without leaking, hardening, or loss of flexibility. Silicone tubing is more permeable than other elastomeric tubing so water can more readily escape as a vapor but this happens slowly and can be easily remedied by designed the cooling loop so that the water is easily replenished. I personally prefer soft tubing in PC cooling systems over hard tubing. For one thing it easier to route soft tubing. Also It is not really possible to use quick-disconnect connectors with hard tubing but quick-disconnect connectors work quite well on soft tubing loops and in particular permit much easier maintenance of the cooling system.

Our previous purchase of a different brand stated that it was designed for 1/4\" tubing, but I found out the hard way that you have to be careful and pay attention to the internal diameter, which on the previous product was apparently slightly wider than .017. Result - drippers and tees would fly off unexpectedly, which of course is a disaster for a drip system, since water pressure is now lost to the remaining drippers.

I use anti-kink coils to the keep the tubing from kinking. The lifetime is so far excellent; I have systems that have used it for years without leaking, hardening, or loss of flexibility. Silicone tubing is more permeable than other elastomeric tubing so water can more readily escape as a vapor but this happens slowly and can be easily remedied by designed the cooling loop so that the water is easily replenished. I personally prefer soft tubing in PC cooling systems over hard tubing. For one thing it easier to route soft tubing. Also It is not really possible to use quick-disconnect connectors with hard tubing but quick-disconnect connectors work quite well on soft tubing loops and in particular permit much easier maintenance of the cooling system.

It also collapsed a few times on the suction side of the pump, the same pump I use all the time for brewing liquid transfers. It was a waste of money for my application. So unless you are using this for straight or very mild bends (with support) and with very little suction best to find something else . Even coming straight out of a connection with only a couple of feet of hose it kinked with the weight of the liquid in it. The positive is the hose did hold up to the heat just fine.",

I use anti-kink coils to the keep the tubing from kinking. The lifetime is so far excellent; I have systems that have used it for years without leaking, hardening, or loss of flexibility. Silicone tubing is more permeable than other elastomeric tubing so water can more readily escape as a vapor but this happens slowly and can be easily remedied by designed the cooling loop so that the water is easily replenished. I personally prefer soft tubing in PC cooling systems over hard tubing. For one thing it easier to route soft tubing.
