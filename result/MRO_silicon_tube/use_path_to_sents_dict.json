PVC was recommended because the condensate from a tankless water heater is acidic. This tubing works well for that purpose. I only needed about 3 ft., so I cannot comment on whether it would work well over much longer distances. I did not have any of the problems others have reported -- e.g., flat spots and/or kinks in the hose caused by its being coiled tightly for shipping, kinking during use, etc. -- but that may be due to the fact that I purchased and I am using a short length of the tubing. I thought the price was high for just 3 ft. of tubing. The unit price (per ft) is much more reasonable if you purchase longer lengths, but I had no use for more than 3 ft."

As long as you make gentle bends to go around corners, the tubing won't kink. Since it is silicone, don't expect to be able to heat it to make clean tight bends in the tubing. That is different from what this tubing was designed to do. Please give yourself ample space for curves in the tubing; it should work fine without collapsing. If you need tight bends, cut-in separate plastic elbow pieces that you can find here on Amazon. It worked for connecting the output of a drain pan to the floor drain."

It's tight enough of a fit to prevent leaking, but not so tight that it's a chore to get it off. The only mod that it was impossible to use with was the Hugo Squeezer. That mod needs tubing with a 3mm ID. It was possible to get this 2mm ID tubing attached to a REO, but it was a struggle. a 3mm ID is best for that as well. The 4mm OD fits the cap hole in nearly every bottle, both \"brand name\" ones (Pulse, Lost Vape, Squeezer, DaOne and others) and the generic ones (YFTK and similar 'no name' bottles). Again, the stock Hugo Squeezer bottle was the exception. The hole in the cap is made for a 5mm OD tube. But, since there are a lot of bottles that work with this tubing and fit the Squeezer, it's not a major problem (unless you only have the Squeezer and no other bottles). Excellent value for the length -- got my tubing needs covered for quite some time."

And the stamped-on lettering is a mark of a quality product. These fit 1/4\" drip irrigation fixtures perfectly. We have a large lawn with a lot of shrubs that have their own individual 1gph Raindrip dripper, and this fits the bill very nicely, The .017 internal diameter grips the barbs of fittings like tees and drippers just like it's supposed to. Our previous purchase of a different brand stated that it was designed for 1/4\" tubing, but I found out the hard way that you have to be careful and pay attention to the internal diameter, which on the previous product was apparently slightly wider than .017. Result - drippers and tees would fly off unexpectedly, which of course is a disaster for a drip system, since water pressure is now lost to the remaining drippers. These UDP's are the perfect .017 size that Raindrip, DIG and other 1/4\" barbed fittings are designed for, and nice and flexible so that you don't have to struggle while attaching the fittings.

        "<b>My new indoor gardening hose</b> I was concerned by another review that complained about permanent kinks in the tubing due to packaging. I'm glad that I decided to take a chance on this product anyway. The tubing did in fact have kinks in it when it arrived. I found that under moderate pressure, and with some gentle stretching and massaging, the kinks eventually popped back to normal appearance and literally disappeared. The entire process of installing and clearing the kinks took only a few minutes. This tubing is thin walled and very limber. It swells in diameter a bit when under pressure. I haven't measured the pressure in my application, but it can't be more the a few psi. The slight swell presents no problem for my use of it as an indoor watering hose. I am not subjecting it to faucet pressure. It is getting the output pressure of a small DC transfer pump with the pressure switch set to the minimum value. This allows me to pump dilute fertilizer directly to my plants. The five Meter length is enough to reach all of my plants and the soft flexible tubing insures that I won't do any damage as I move around with it. It is also easy to coil up for storage when it is not in use. The PVC tube I used previously was clumsy by comparison."

It isn't clear. Very soft , stretchable, and pliable. The manufacturing quality is excellent. Silicone rubber adhesive sicks to it well. I am using it to replace the drinking tube on my thermos. I got tied of the tip and pour your drink down your chest deal. This way I can pop the flip cap and such it out. Looks really good."

        "<b>odor in water</b> Works great with all the 1/2\" PEX fittings. Unfortunately it leaves a strong chemical/plastic odor in the water. It is very noticeable with you shower or wash your face in the morning. I figured this would subside in time.. still have odor after 8 months. Strongest when water has not run for a wile. Now it has been about 14 months and I don't smell it much anymore."
