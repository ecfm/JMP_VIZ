        "clings to wood debris<<<velvet material|||B0BZPSYWHQ ★★★★☆ [2023-09-30] <b>Very pretty for small projects, strange wood debris</b> There was some tiny wood debris (It looked like shavings leftover from the wooden spools) all over the ribbon spools when I unboxed them. The velvet material clings to stuff like that, so I had to brush them off and lint roll them. I really wish the seller had done more cleanup on the spools so that wouldn't have happened, but the ribbon itself is fine with lovely colors. Just know if you're doing a larger project--say you need to make multiple gift baskets--you can quickly run out of a color. The amount on the spools is pretty small. These will definitely work for my needs, and I'm happy."

Er hat eine glänzende und eine leicht matte Seite. Klar kann man damit große Geschenke einpacken und tolle Schleifen binden aber ich nutze so breite Bänder auch gerne auf Karten. Ich war ganz gespannt wie sich dieses Band embossen lässt, also mit einem Heißluftfön Pigmente einbrennen. Was soll ich sagen es geht, zwar ist die Struktur nicht hervorstehend da sich das Pulver in das Band einsaugt aber es geht und das Band ist danach auch noch flexibelso das man auch Grüße auf das Geschenkband Stempeln und embossen kann. Mein Fazit: Ein tolles Band für kreative Menschen."

He had an earlier edition of that book that had other animals and how to make this bow in it.) The softness of the ribbon made it hard for me to work with but I am now 70 and realizing that I am losing my dexterity that I had when I first made the bow in my 20’s or earlier.

One thing that I noticed immediately about the product was the packaging. It comes on a styrofoam spool with no ridges to hold it in place. I find it near impossible to store, and even more impossible to wrap the excess up when I am done using it. If the ribbon came on a cardboard spool with edges to keep it in place, I might have given this product another star. This might not be something that bothers anyone else, but if you are looking to store it and use it on multiple different projects, I suggest finding a different spool to store the ribbon on. Other than that, the ribbon was of decent quality. As I said, you get great yardage for the price, but the ribbon does feel a bit cheaper. There is one side that is clearly a more shiny satin than the other. Additionally, the ribbon is a bit see-through. Further, when cut with scissors, the ribbon almost immediately frays, as seen in the attached photos. This is a problem with any ribbon but was especially noticeable with this one. I have yet to attempt to seal it with a lighter, but I am not sure how well that would work as the ribbon immediately disintegrates into a million strings after you cut it. Overall, if you are looking to do a project that requires a large amount of ribbon and you aren't too worried about the quality, then I suggest this product. But, if you are looking for ribbon to use throughout multiple projects, or want a nicer quality ribbon, then I suggest you look elsewhere.",
        "ends start to fray after multiple uses|||B0C9WTP1J2 ★★★★★ [2023-09-15] <b>Soft, flexible, great color</b> This is great ribbon that could be used for many things like decorating, pulling hair back, clothing, gift wrap, etc. I am using this to string up a banner. The ends did start to fray a bit after putting them through the banners several times, but that could be trimmed off or glued down.

Especially with Mother's Day around the corner, there's an endless amount of possibilities of what you can do with this ribbon to turn something simple and customize it with your own style. I chose the red ribbon and I've already started wrapping with it. Because of how thin the ribbon is, this would be better for smaller gifts if you'd like to wrap a ribbon around it. Or, you can also tie this to the handle of a bag to make it a little different. Larger gifts might require thicker or wider bows, and therefore this might not be appropriate by itself. It can work as a compliment to a bigger bow. I typically go for ribbons with wires just because they're a little easier to work with when you need the ribbon to conform to a specific angle or shape, but this wasn't difficult to use. The only thing that I would say is that if you typically tape or staple your ribbons sometimes to keep them in place, this isn't the ribbon that's going to cooperate well. Hot glue guns might be better to use when working with this ribbon to get it to form a particular shape or angle. Some examples of craft projects I'm currently working on are using these ribbons on small vases and wrapping of small items for jewelries and handmade bracelets. The feel of the ribbon felt okay. It didn't feel as soft as I expected but more like paper. I would still get this again but in different colors for other DIY projects I'm thinking about."

I let its poor-quality go, though, since I intended to use it only for hanging ornaments on a little tree & I had no difficulty looping it into the ring of each of the small ornaments to be hung later in the year. That was before actually hanging them on the tree. Its lacking in body made it difficult to tie the bows whose little loops just hung, adding difficulty to completing the bow since I had to make the loops small just to get them to stand up. If you can imagine trying to make a bow with thread or string, you'll understand how that made a job which should have been pleasant a labor instead.

        "Likely okay for washer and dryer|||B0C52SKZD6 ★★★★☆ [2023-01-24] <b>Better than I first realized</b> Updated my review: At first I was very grumpy that it's only 5 yards per color (for a TOTAL of 30 yards) but after an hour on Amazon, I realize that for $10, I should have known that it wouldn't be 180 yards. I am able to use this with my sewing machine, and while it was really difficult to fold and iron flat- it doesn't hold a crease very well and I couldn't get it to fold straight- it held up fabulously under my sewing machine.

That having been said, the colors of this lot were as follows: the navy was deep - almost black. The emerald green was spot on old fashioned green (think beleek) and the forest green is deep and rich. The blue is a robins egg, not a teal as in many of the pics. The gray is a pigeon color, and the yellow is a rich warm marigold. The maroon is a rich garnet, and the peach is a true baby peach. As for the pinks: the pale is a true baby girl pink, the hot pink is somewhere between Barbie pink and strawberry, and the red is a cool true red. The purple however is not a royal rich purple.

Each year I craft homemade sauces, rubs, or other food gifts that I usually package in jars topped with a bit of colorful cloth. But when I ran out of narrow, delicate ribbon last year I was at a loss. Most traditional ribbon is either too thick or too stiff – or both – so it simply doesn’t work well for that type of task. This Vitalizart ribbon is practically perfect for my wrapping needs. It’s soft, supple, ties easily, and it stays in place. I think the small wooden spools are a lovely touch. They're so much classier than a cardboard spool – plus with the white ribbon they remind me of a little stack of double-stuffed Oreos. Cute! BOTTOM LINE: The Vitalizart satin ribbon is a well-made, quality product. And at a price-point of about $7 (at the time of this review), it’s an extremely good value for gift-wrap or crafting."

It holds well and you can have crisp positioning; on the downside, because the wire is stronger and holds the shape better, it’s slightly difficult to position. The colors/prints are vibrant with minimal loose strings from rough/scissor cuts, and in my opinion the ribbon doesn’t need the tips sealed.

I had looked at the wrong place on the spool and thought the iron had only temporarily made a color change with the heat but in fact I found the place where I hit it with an iron and the dye is indeed gone.

This did not launch on my computer and I could not gain access to it despite many attempts. I also accessed the website and the PDF walkthroughs to best understand how to complete a bow with the assistance of this device. It was well explained in the written guides online, with step-by-step instructions and visuals. The idea behind this tool is useful, but more-so for individuals looking for a quick way to assemble their scraps into a reusable and presentable form. A lot of the styles in the provided examples are dated and much more appropriate for an older crowd. The number one feature I found was that this holds your material in place while you assemble and tie it all together. Otherwise, it is a very simplistic device with more of a purpose for those who may have difficulty with fine motor skills but want to design and complete decorative bows on their own."

I let my husband do it every now and again when it comes to gifts that he gives to his friends, me, or if it's something sentimental for his parents (and yes, someone always makes the joke \"I know who wrapped this one!\"). I did find out that he had pull riboon roll for bows, which his mother had given him (you can always hide bad wrapping with a nice bow). It beat making my own bows so I got really used to using his stash, and basically used it up. I went back to making my own bows, using my fingers and toes, and sometimes knees to hold all the loops down and I cursed the day that he didn't have more magical bow rolls stashed somewhere else in his closet. Then this came into my feed. A Bow Maker. One where I didn't have to ask the kids to put their fingers in the middle and actually sit still until it was finished. Or one where I didn't have to squish my husband's finger while trying to tie a knot in the middle of the loops (just for his finger to get caught, we get into a situation and I have to start all over). One thing I wish though, is that it came apart so that I can easily store it. The large middle pieces could have been made to slide out so it's more compact. Instead, it's stuck in the position where you have to store it as is.",

I like to use ribbons for card making, and these have just the right width (3/8 inch) and are DOUBLE-SIDED. It really looks so much better when tying bows, if the ribbon is double-sided. It just doesn’t look tidy when the “bad side” of a one sided ribbon shows up after tying a bow. Other Positives: 1) The colors are vivid, there are 20 colors. Two of the colors are gold and silver. The gold and silver are shimmery and has a grosgrain look to it. 2) The ribbons have a smooth, satin finish to it. It is made of 100% polyester. Very easy to work with and making bows. The cut ends will fray. Sometimes I use a bit of glue on the ends to stop the fraying. 3) As soon as I saw all the colors, I thought of all the different cards I can make. Red ribbon for Valentine’s and Christmas, Orange and black for Halloween, blue for July 4th, etc. 4) Value priced, too at 48 cents a spool. There are 15 yards per roll for a total of 300 yards. This will last me a long time. These ribbons are great to have on hand for crafting, gift wrapping, or party events. I recommend them for value and quality."

In person, it's a cheesecloth/gauze type fabric. What gives it legs is the quality of the dye. The color, especially on the darker blue, is even with True to color hue. This set in Sky Blue, Navy & White is my fave to use on magnetic gift boxes. Most boxes have a gloss finish & the gauze in contrast looks simply tasteful. Plus the lightweight lets you layer colors to give more depth to the eye. You will need 3 hands to tie it on a glossy surface but the end result shines. The other set was in Burgundy, Pink & White but didn't figure out layering til the blue. No I am not redoing bows but this set has grown on me so give it a chance.

I bought two rolls for 10 yards total. When I took off the cellophane wrap I could see that the ribbon had a white (!) cloth backing and the nap of the velvet is a bubble gum pink and not the dusty rose depicted. The \"velvet\" is nothing like woven velvet of the quality you want to use for fabric sewing of any kind from dust covers, slip covers, to hair accessories and garments such as hats or dresses. Real velvet ribbon is going to be soft and floppy. This was clearly intended for gift wrapping purposes imho, as stiff as could be. I asked the seller about use for some slip covers so this was disappointing. Further, you really cannot 'tie' this ribbon, only use it flat: if using for gift wrap. Returning. The seller had me print a return label for postage paid shipping back via USPS for the mailman to pick up and that seems really convenient. I will update as to how the return/refund process goes with this seller. UPDATE: The seller did issue my refund. One extra star for that but this is not the quality ribbon that a real seamstress expects for sewing with fabrics for use in clothing or home decor items. Look at how stiff the bow is that another reviewer showed when used as gift wrap. It looked okay but I would not personally use it for gift wrap since you will only get a stiff bow."

It's the trend where you wrap your front door to look like a present (1 band horizonatally, 1 band vertically and then put a bow at the intersection). Pretty easy to do and this material was perfect for the harsh outside weather. It has a velvety feel which makes it look expensive. After 2.5 months outside, it didn't lose even a bit of its color, and I kept the ribbon to reattempt the next year as well.

Ich bin auch nicht enttäuscht worden. Die Farbe ist wirklich toll. Auch die Qualität des Bandes kann überzeugen. Die Breite ist ca. 10 cm, die Länge soll lt. Hersteller 20 m sein, nachgemessen habe ich aber nicht. Die Vorder- und Rückseite des Bandes sind etwas unterschiedlich glänzend und dieses Band sieht zu einer Schleife gebunden sehr edel aus. Ich werde es mir für besondere Geschenke zurücklegen. Ein kleiner Tipp von mir: Wenn man so ein schönes Band mehrfach verwenden möchte (für Weihnachtsdeko z.B.), dann kann man Knicke und Falten ganz einfach wegbügeln, wenn man das Bügeleisen auf ganz schwache Hitze stellt. Fazit: Einn wirklich, tolles, dekoratives Band, allerdings auch nicht günstig.",

If buying in quantity view it as a long-term investment. I recommend reading the product title extra carefully as it's the product description. One reviewer complains it's not curling ribbon, but it doesn't say it's curling ribbon and you can tell it's not curling ribbon from the advert photo. It is \"gift-wrapping\" ribbon, as per the description, in that you wrap it around the gift and/or tie a bow to embellish. Bought to: 1. Wrap around homemade gatefold greeting cards (as the kind of 'belly band' you untie). 2. Make ribbon bows to embellish greeting cards. 3. Sew in inside a greeting card the paper to write on and sign. Impressive for little effort and so better than glue. This ribbon glues well, using high-tack glue, hold the bits together (or use a clip) for a while afterwards though. The gold colour will look great on Christmas cards. I came here to order more in case it becomes unavailable, and to consider other colours, because with scores to make I'll start making them soon (I know people who've already started). Therefore, if you're considering buying, don't delay and maybe buy a bit more in case :-)",

One thing that I noticed immediately about the product was the packaging. It comes on a styrofoam spool with no ridges to hold it in place. I find it near impossible to store, and even more impossible to wrap the excess up when I am done using it. If the ribbon came on a cardboard spool with edges to keep it in place, I might have given this product another star. This might not be something that bothers anyone else, but if you are looking to store it and use it on multiple different projects, I suggest finding a different spool to store the ribbon on. Other than that, the ribbon was of decent quality. As I said, you get great yardage for the price, but the ribbon does feel a bit cheaper. There is one side that is clearly a more shiny satin than the other. Additionally, the ribbon is a bit see-through. Further, when cut with scissors, the ribbon almost immediately frays, as seen in the attached photos. This is a problem with any ribbon but was especially noticeable with this one. I have yet to attempt to seal it with a lighter, but I am not sure how well that would work as the ribbon immediately disintegrates into a million strings after you cut it. Overall, if you are looking to do a project that requires a large amount of ribbon and you aren't too worried about the quality, then I suggest this product. But, if you are looking for ribbon to use throughout multiple projects, or want a nicer quality ribbon, then I suggest you look elsewhere."

However, you do get the ribbons on those flimsy styrofoam circles shown in the pictures unfortunately, and they do not have those little \"bumpers\" that keep the ribbon on the spool.

Cards scrapbooking adorning clothing, hats you name it this sky's the limit. I like how the 20 colors of 100 yards of ribbon come in a nice display package with little indentations to keep each roll. That's really neat. I did notice that a couple of my 🌈 rainbow colors had less on the roll than the other rolls had, so I don't know what's up with that but every inch counts. Today my mom and I decided to string some really nice pony beads I'm also testing onto a length of the lime green ribbon. To make sure that the beads would stay on for my mom we knotted one near the bottom of one end of the length that I kind of measured not with tape just kind of put it around my neck and figured out how big I'd want it for it to go over her neck easy. Since we both shake with essential tremor, I wanted to make it easier for her to string the thin ribbon into the big pony bead openings. So I wrapped some Scotch tape around the other end. I wish I could show you that first video I made for you guys. I had it too thick and somehow I also had it the tape on slow motion? So it's really weird but it would take too long to upload I'm sure. Also my mom was joking with me and pulling the tip of the ribbon away so I couldn't stick the little bead on. It was funny you had to be there I guess haha just imagine it. 😜 Anyway, I made the tape narrower and it finally worked perfectly for my mom to string the beads on. It gives her practice with patterning and remembering colors and just hand eye coordination and all those mental gymnastics we need to do to keep our aging brains sharp. Plus she loves jewelry so making her own is even better. It's great how this pack of ribbon gives you so many colors at once without you having to buy 10,000 yards of each. Made in China."

        "Stiff|||B0BKR6C7JF ★★☆☆☆ [2022-12-26] <b>Suitable for gift wrap only. Color not true to photo</b> I received the product quickly to my mail box. I bought two rolls for 10 yards total. When I took off the cellophane wrap I could see that the ribbon had a white (!) cloth backing and the nap of the velvet is a bubble gum pink and not the dusty rose depicted. The \"velvet\" is nothing like woven velvet of the quality you want to use for fabric sewing of any kind from dust covers, slip covers, to hair accessories and garments such as hats or dresses. Real velvet ribbon is going to be soft and floppy. This was clearly intended for gift wrapping purposes imho, as stiff as could be. I asked the seller about use for some slip covers so this was disappointing. Further, you really cannot 'tie' this ribbon, only use it flat: if using for gift wrap. Returning. The seller had me print a return label for postage paid shipping back via USPS for the mailman to pick up and that seems really convenient. I will update as to how the return/refund process goes with this seller. UPDATE: The seller did issue my refund. One extra star for that but this is not the quality ribbon that a real seamstress expects for sewing with fabrics for use in clothing or home decor items. Look at how stiff the bow is that another reviewer showed when used as gift wrap. It looked okay but I would not personally use it for gift wrap since you will only get a stiff bow.",

The colors and printing are definitely Grinchy and they nail the exact hues and images from the movies. The wire is flexible and easy to manipulate into bows or otherwise. The material isn't the greatest and has some sheerness to it, but when they're all tied up, they look fantastic and full. Two of the rolls have glitter accents, the others do not. The glitter does tend to shed, as glitter does, so be aware of that. The rolls are short and probably not enough in one roll to wrap a gift properly. They are, however, perfect for wreath and tree bows or other DIY holiday crafts. They are super festive, very fun to look at and I can't wait to put them on my wreaths this Decemeber!"

NEUTRALS: - The ribbons are a bit thinner than I expected; most of my velvet ribbons are completely opaque, but these you are able to see your finger through if you’re holding it. Since I’m just using this for wrapping and small designs, it’s not a major issue for me personally. CONS: - The ribbon is both lighter and more orange toned than it appeared in the listing images (I checked it under different light sources). I would call it a brown orange over a khaki for sure. - The ends fray if you don’t use incredibly sharp shears. DIRECTLY GIFTABLE?: Sure, it’s just a plain white ribbon wheel, wrapped in plastic. Nothing notable really. CONCLUSION: - It’s a nice ribbon, but the color and fray potential is why it still landed at four stars for me. I wouldn’t go out of my way to recommend it, but I wouldn’t advise against it either."

        "frays immediately when cut|||B08M5QMQLP ★★★☆☆ [2022-04-23] <b>Cheaper ribbon, but great quantity for the price.</b> I bought this product to use for multiple projects, and so far it has served its purpose well. One thing that I noticed immediately about the product was the packaging. It comes on a styrofoam spool with no ridges to hold it in place. I find it near impossible to store, and even more impossible to wrap the excess up when I am done using it. If the ribbon came on a cardboard spool with edges to keep it in place, I might have given this product another star. This might not be something that bothers anyone else, but if you are looking to store it and use it on multiple different projects, I suggest finding a different spool to store the ribbon on. Other than that, the ribbon was of decent quality. As I said, you get great yardage for the price, but the ribbon does feel a bit cheaper. There is one side that is clearly a more shiny satin than the other. Additionally, the ribbon is a bit see-through. Further, when cut with scissors, the ribbon almost immediately frays, as seen in the attached photos. This is a problem with any ribbon but was especially noticeable with this one. I have yet to attempt to seal it with a lighter, but I am not sure how well that would work as the ribbon immediately disintegrates into a million strings after you cut it. Overall, if you are looking to do a project that requires a large amount of ribbon and you aren't too worried about the quality, then I suggest this product. But, if you are looking for ribbon to use throughout multiple projects, or want a nicer quality ribbon, then I suggest you look elsewhere.",

It's strips of velvet fabric cut into ribbons with raw edges. It is a thinner material (you can see light through it if you hold it up to the light), but that also makes it much softer and more \"flowy\" than other velvet ribbons. The green color is a dark evergreen and is perfect for Christmas. Keep in mind, since it's more like a raw cut fabric rather than a traditional ribbon, it does fray on the cut end."

I like to use ribbons for card making, and these have just the right width (3/8 inch) and are DOUBLE-SIDED. It really looks so much better when tying bows, if the ribbon is double-sided. It just doesn’t look tidy when the “bad side” of a one sided ribbon shows up after tying a bow. Other Positives: 1) The colors are vivid, there are 20 colors. Two of the colors are gold and silver. The gold and silver are shimmery and has a grosgrain look to it. 2) The ribbons have a smooth, satin finish to it. It is made of 100% polyester. Very easy to work with and making bows. The cut ends will fray. Sometimes I use a bit of glue on the ends to stop the fraying. 3) As soon as I saw all the colors, I thought of all the different cards I can make. Red ribbon for Valentine’s and Christmas, Orange and black for Halloween, blue for July 4th, etc. 4) Value priced, too at 48 cents a spool. There are 15 yards per roll for a total of 300 yards. This will last me a long time. These ribbons are great to have on hand for crafting, gift wrapping, or party events. I recommend them for value and quality."

Really liked the pure gold ones but again the glitter is so bad. Had to wrap the presents in the garage and shake them a few times to try to get most of the glitter off. The 2 that had designs look and feel cheap. They have a thin plastic feel to them and they are see through. So out of 4 rolls I will only be using the 2 pure gold ones. The other 2 will go to the trash unfortunately. I will not be ordering again.

That said, the price hike from the mini bow maker to the hair bow maker is a bit silly considering you only get a ruler plate that doesn't even properly snap to the main unit.

I remember reading other reviews say the wire was on the thin side, but I actually preferred it like that because I could easily cut the ribbon with scissors and not pliers. The width of the 2.5 inch was just what I needed for a large box. The blue color is very rich and regal looking. I also got the 1.5\" in gold, and it looks as it should be, I just haven't gotten to use it yet. The amount of ribbon on each spool is a lot, so definitely worth the money to me. I didn't want to fear not having enough for my present or wrapping one single gift and not having enough for future gifts. The amount is also great because I want to practice my bows. I thought I would have to practice a lot, since it was my first time making a pompom bow, however, it was perfect on the first try."

This year, I decided to do elegant with gold wrapping paper and black velvet ribbon. PROS: - This ribbon is beautiful and exactly what I was thinking of/hoping for. It 100% elevates my presents and makes them look very luxurious. - It doesn't fray! LOVE that. I have had ribbon fray before, and it's not fun. CONS: - Unlike normal ribbon, the velvet is only one-sided, so when I wrap bows or tie knots, you can see the backside and it is not cute. - Cutting the velvet creates some fuzz! It's not annoying or anything, but can cause a mess when you're wrapping in excess. - It really isn't a lot... I bought three of these spools thinking it would be enough. I typically wrap my presents with that \"T\" shape, but doing that was going to make me go broke, especially with the amount of presents I am wrapping. I ended up buying more spools and just wrapping the ribbon around once. OVERALL: I still really love this ribbon and highly recommend it. If you are not great at tying bows I would suggest you do some research (if this is what you are using it for), as it can look really tacky if the ribbon is not laying right."

        "Can create elaborate and elegant bows|||B0C24XWHW4 ★★★★☆ [2023-05-27] <b>NO MORE STORE BOUGHT BOWS FOR ME!</b> Hey y’all! How many of you much like myself have gone to Wedding showers, Baby Showers, Birthdays, Anniversary parties, Graduation parties or ANY Holidays parties with your wrapped gift which looks like a 5 year old wrapped it (well at least mine always do!) and those cheap bows you get a lot of during Christmas? I am guilty on all charges of that wrapping scenario! As I browse over the table of gifts yet to be opened there’s always a few people that are very talented in gift wrapping and make me quickly feel inferior when I see their military sharp edges not a wrinkle in the wrapping paper anywhere and they seem to have only used a single piece of tape to secure it AND will have the most elaborate bow on top?! Well that’s about to change for me ladies! With this Bowdabra mini bow kit I am going into Bow wars with all those ladies with their perfectly wrapped packages and elaborate bows! Look out ladies I have a Bowdabra mini bow maker and I’m not afraid to use it! I may not be able to have military grade edges on my gift boxes BUT I will have THE MOST elaborate most elegant most beautiful custom made (by me!) BOWS on any gift there! Nobody’s hiding my gifts over in the corner anymore! With this amazing little gadget I won’t ever be embarrassed by my wrapping gifts ever again! I think the most elegant and exquisite bows can hide a multitude of bad gift wrapping jobs! I just know my days of those cheap dollar store bows are over! I will now proudly place my gifts front and center when I make the beautiful bows that will make all the other packages look pale in comparison to mine! Thank you BOWDABRA!! You have given me a new wind and new imagination to create one of a kind bows that will make all the other ladies wanting to know where I got those elegant looking bows! I will keep that little secret to myself at least for a while! I want to thank you for giving my review a read I truly try my best to give honest detailed opinions because I read reviews on things I want to buy too! So I hope I have been helpful to you!",

        "Versatile in creating different types of bows|||B0C24XWHW4 ★★★★★ [2023-05-20] <b>I LOVE this!</b> I had never heard of Bow-dabra before seeing this on Amazon. And it is so versatile I can hardly wait to make bows to include on gifts, for children's hair, and even decorations. The Bow-dabra comes with an instruction book which is great but the creators went the extra mile and included a DVD to demonstrate just what you can do with it. VERY nice. The DVD is divided into sections so you can go right to the type of bow you want to make. Or, you can watch the entire thing all the way through which I did. You can make tiny bows for hair, decorative bows for packages, bows that include foil decorations, berries, flowers, or anything you can think of to include in the bow. They even demonstrate how to use up old scraps of ribbon to make a gorgeous bow. And these bows can get massive! You just have to see it after purchasing the Bow-dabra. I am planning a Bow-dabra party for my friends, to show them what all it will do. Summer is a great time to start thinking about Christmas decorations and gift wrapping so it would be fun to let each guest make a bow of their choosing. The guests can either bring their own ribbon and decorations or I could provide those. Either way, it's more fun if you do it yourself and have something to show. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that each bow you make uses a gold wire that is conveniently included in the Bow-dabra box. There is enough for about 10 bows. Do you can get the hang of it before buying more wire. The wire is only used to hold the bow together, so you could probably find some other colors. But I love the gold. It adds elegance to every bow. This is the cutest and most useful craft item I have seen in a long time. You just have to get one and try it for yourself. I LOVE this!"

It best assists when working with multiple materials and/or layers but is easiest to learn on single layered bows. This device would be most useful as a gift for individuals who experience pain, fatigue, or difficulty with fine motor movements. This set arrives with the main gadget, a ruler that slots on top and then a piece to evenly scrunch down your DIY bow. In addition, it also includes a CD-ROM, membership on the website and a roll of metallic tie. Personally, I feel as though the CD-ROM format is very dated; in order to access the tutorial, there is an application that must run. This did not launch on my computer and I could not gain access to it despite many attempts. I also accessed the website and the PDF walkthroughs to best understand how to complete a bow with the assistance of this device. It was well explained in the written guides online, with step-by-step instructions and visuals. The idea behind this tool is useful, but more-so for individuals looking for a quick way to assemble their scraps into a reusable and presentable form. A lot of the styles in the provided examples are dated and much more appropriate for an older crowd. The number one feature I found was that this holds your material in place while you assemble and tie it all together. Otherwise, it is a very simplistic device with more of a purpose for those who may have difficulty with fine motor skills but want to design and complete decorative bows on their own."

The metallic gold plays off of the burlap very well and I like the wired edges. That said, this does not make a good big fluffy bow with lots of loops. This is a better choice for the clipped bows that use several different ribbons that are cris-crossed and then pulled up. Or a simple one loop bow tied with some string or raffia in the middle. This is a great ribbon for gift wrapping and tying a gift bag.

I've taken to just wrapping blankets, sweaters, etc. in a ribbon for the presentation. This ribbon is quite beautiful. I choose a sage green, so that it's neutral on any gift. It's very delicate and the frayed edges look so pretty on packages. The ribbon is about 1.5 inches wide and 5 yards long per spool. (You get 4 spools in the package.) This means I can wrap quite a few packages in this ribbon. at 1.5 inches, I tend to use this for smaller packages, with thinner yarn. it's more of a summer wrap. Because the chiffon is thin, this is very gauzy, so be aware that it's not a robust, satiny ribbon. It's very very delicate. I like it a lot."

The ribbon width looks lovely on packages and the length of each piece is sufficient for a single box. I was a little bit surprised to discover that these do not come on spools like I'd expected. Some come all squished together in a bag, and others are tied and put in a bag. It's not a huge deal, since I just hung them on a doorknob for a few days to get any wrinkles out and they were fine (you can iron them too). It's also nice that it cuts down on waste and I don't have to throw out all those cardboard cores. Overall, this is very nice quality ribbon and you get a sufficient quantity of each pattern to use for gift wrapping and I certainly recommend it."

It best assists when working with multiple materials and/or layers but is easiest to learn on single layered bows. This device would be most useful as a gift for individuals who experience pain, fatigue, or difficulty with fine motor movements. This set arrives with the main gadget, a ruler that slots on top and then a piece to evenly scrunch down your DIY bow. In addition, it also includes a CD-ROM, membership on the website and a roll of metallic tie. Personally, I feel as though the CD-ROM format is very dated; in order to access the tutorial, there is an application that must run. This did not launch on my computer and I could not gain access to it despite many attempts. I also accessed the website and the PDF walkthroughs to best understand how to complete a bow with the assistance of this device. It was well explained in the written guides online, with step-by-step instructions and visuals. The idea behind this tool is useful, but more-so for individuals looking for a quick way to assemble their scraps into a reusable and presentable form. A lot of the styles in the provided examples are dated and much more appropriate for an older crowd. The number one feature I found was that this holds your material in place while you assemble and tie it all together. Otherwise, it is a very simplistic device with more of a purpose for those who may have difficulty with fine motor skills but want to design and complete decorative bows on their own."

I shouldn't say neon because it's not trendy neon - its just the perfect shade of \"extra\" you want in a pink ribbon. I ordered several rolls of the 50 yards and doubt it will ever run out.

When I want to give ‘thank you’ cash to mail person, UPS, FedEx, Amazon drivers, recycle and landfill and yard waste bin pick-up people, etc., I tape a length of this narrow ribbon inside each holiday card and tie it around the bills I’ve folded to fit. Thus makes me sound like Lady Bountiful on Boxing Day, but that couldn’t be further from the truth.

Ich werde es mir für besondere Geschenke zurücklegen. Ein kleiner Tipp von mir: Wenn man so ein schönes Band mehrfach verwenden möchte (für Weihnachtsdeko z.B.), dann kann man Knicke und Falten ganz einfach wegbügeln, wenn man das Bügeleisen auf ganz schwache Hitze stellt.

NEUTRALS: - The ribbons are a bit thinner than I expected; most of my velvet ribbons are completely opaque, but these you are able to see your finger through if you’re holding it. Since I’m just using this for wrapping and small designs, it’s not a major issue for me personally. CONS: - The ribbon is both lighter and more orange toned than it appeared in the listing images (I checked it under different light sources). I would call it a brown orange over a khaki for sure. - The ends fray if you don’t use incredibly sharp shears. DIRECTLY GIFTABLE?: Sure, it’s just a plain white ribbon wheel, wrapped in plastic. Nothing notable really. CONCLUSION: - It’s a nice ribbon, but the color and fray potential is why it still landed at four stars for me. I wouldn’t go out of my way to recommend it, but I wouldn’t advise against it either."

I love the frayed edges for a more rustic, natural, farmhouse sort of vibe, but if you don’t like frayed edges and want something neater, this isn’t the choice for you. Like all chiffon, it’s a bit challenging to work with, but a sharp pair of scissors is your friend."

        "Can be used for various arts and crafts<<<Multicolored skinny ribbons with 20 colors|||B09XM6ZN1Q ★★★★☆ [2022-09-17] <b>We had a lot of fun threading pony beads onto the green 💚 today</b> These really nice multicolored skinny ribbons can be used for all kinds of arts and crafts. Cards scrapbooking adorning clothing, hats you name it this sky's the limit. I like how the 20 colors of 100 yards of ribbon come in a nice display package with little indentations to keep each roll. That's really neat. I did notice that a couple of my 🌈 rainbow colors had less on the roll than the other rolls had, so I don't know what's up with that but every inch counts. Today my mom and I decided to string some really nice pony beads I'm also testing onto a length of the lime green ribbon. To make sure that the beads would stay on for my mom we knotted one near the bottom of one end of the length that I kind of measured not with tape just kind of put it around my neck and figured out how big I'd want it for it to go over her neck easy. Since we both shake with essential tremor, I wanted to make it easier for her to string the thin ribbon into the big pony bead openings. So I wrapped some Scotch tape around the other end. I wish I could show you that first video I made for you guys. I had it too thick and somehow I also had it the tape on slow motion? So it's really weird but it would take too long to upload I'm sure. Also my mom was joking with me and pulling the tip of the ribbon away so I couldn't stick the little bead on. It was funny you had to be there I guess haha just imagine it. 😜 Anyway, I made the tape narrower and it finally worked perfectly for my mom to string the beads on. It gives her practice with patterning and remembering colors and just hand eye coordination and all those mental gymnastics we need to do to keep our aging brains sharp. Plus she loves jewelry so making her own is even better. It's great how this pack of ribbon gives you so many colors at once without you having to buy 10,000 yards of each. Made in China."

It best assists when working with multiple materials and/or layers but is easiest to learn on single layered bows. This device would be most useful as a gift for individuals who experience pain, fatigue, or difficulty with fine motor movements. This set arrives with the main gadget, a ruler that slots on top and then a piece to evenly scrunch down your DIY bow. In addition, it also includes a CD-ROM, membership on the website and a roll of metallic tie. Personally, I feel as though the CD-ROM format is very dated; in order to access the tutorial, there is an application that must run. This did not launch on my computer and I could not gain access to it despite many attempts. I also accessed the website and the PDF walkthroughs to best understand how to complete a bow with the assistance of this device. It was well explained in the written guides online, with step-by-step instructions and visuals. The idea behind this tool is useful, but more-so for individuals looking for a quick way to assemble their scraps into a reusable and presentable form. A lot of the styles in the provided examples are dated and much more appropriate for an older crowd. The number one feature I found was that this holds your material in place while you assemble and tie it all together. Otherwise, it is a very simplistic device with more of a purpose for those who may have difficulty with fine motor skills but want to design and complete decorative bows on their own.",

This is a nice set of spools of ribbon with six different Grinch-y designs. Each spool has five yards of wired ribbon. Two of the ribbons are glitter based and the other four are plain. The ribbons are of good quality and the designs are clear and crisp. The variety is great as you can match the more obvious Grinch themes with the more neutral. Of course, you can use them singly as well. These are good enough quality that they can be used for packages but also for more decor related crafts. Adorning a tree, dressing up a swag, a design element of porch pots, using them as part of a tablescape in your dining room for a dinner party, all of these would be great places to utilize these ribbons. If you use them indoors and are careful about how you pack them away I think you could even get multiple seasons worth of use from them. At less than $3 per roll they seem reasonably priced.",

I wish the darker \"Green\" set in their ad was also made of cotton (since that's the set that would've been my first choice for the decorative project I'm using the ribbon for) but I always choose cotton over polyester whenever I can, so that's why I chose the cotton \"Incanus & Green\" set instead of the polyester \"Green\" set. I really appreciate the company's effort in making most of their ribbons out of cotton instead of polyester, so that they're biodegradable whenever they someday wind up in the trash/dump...(as happens with everything in life eventually...nothing lasts forever lol.) So I heartily applaud & appreciate this company's more natural & eco-conscious approach by making their ribbon mostly out of cotton versus other companies who use polyester. I also like the simplistic, natural brown paper packaging the ribbon comes in. Decorating shouldn't have to be harmful to the environment & this company helps to achieve that! *Thank you!!* :D"

        "Not too stiff|||B0922M29Z4 ★★★☆☆ [2022-03-06] <b>The count came up short</b> This is the product you buy for the price and the quantity, not the quality. We all know it. So I was happy to see a pretty nice set of ribbons when I opened my Amazon box. The colors are vibrant, they were packaged very neatly, and the ribbon was rolled on a round piece of styrofoam. I compared the ribbon to some from the craft store and they are pretty close. This ribbon was a little thinner and the ribs were longer but they felt exactly the same. I’d pick this ribbon as it has the best price. Where the issues showed up were when I went to rewrap each of these onto the flat cardboard bobbins I prefer. I’ve included photos showing the things I found. The silver/grey had a defective area of about 5” right in the middle of the row. The peach/light coral one is two toned the entire length, with one edge much lighter than the other. Some of them, like the yellow are really kinked. I’m not sure how as they were rolled, but there are definitely distinct kinks there. I really hope they relax on their own as I don’t feel like fussing with them. Not a bad thing but you should know that the orange, lime green, and yellow are really neon color. Super bright. The biggest issue is the cut. Of the 24 rolls only 4 are the correct length. 12 rolls, half of the total number, are shorter than 4 yards each. The difference was 1.5 to 7 inches short each. A total of 39.25 inches were missing, more than a yard. The remaining 8 rolls were longer than 4 yards, with the same differences. Maybe they think it balances out? To me it didn’t matter as I have no set lengths I need. But to those of you looking for exactly 4 yards you should probably keep shopping. The ribbon wasn’t too stiff. It’s just like all the other grosgrain ribbon I have. I really do like colors, it’s a great selection. Even with the issues I’d buy this product again. It really is the best price.",

But when I ran out of narrow, delicate ribbon last year I was at a loss. Most traditional ribbon is either too thick or too stiff – or both – so it simply doesn’t work well for that type of task. This Vitalizart ribbon is practically perfect for my wrapping needs. It’s soft, supple, ties easily, and it stays in place. I think the small wooden spools are a lovely touch. They're so much classier than a cardboard spool – plus with the white ribbon they remind me of a little stack of double-stuffed Oreos. Cute!

No more slipping or sliding, just perfectly arranged bows that stay put.

The downside is the same with any velvet ribbon -- it's inherently challenging to work with for tying bows. That is true with every velvet ribbon I've ever had, so I do not consider that a flaw in the product. That's just the nature of velvet. If you've never worked with velvet ribbon before, just know that part going in. I am not using this ribbon for sewing, but having handled it and examined it, I do think that it would be appropriate for a sewing project. The material is on the heavier side, it doesn't have a wired edge, and it doesn't seem to fray too badly. If you plan to use a straight cut end, you might need to add a little fray-stop liquid to keep the end nice and straight. But again, that's true with any velvet ribbon."

I like to use ribbons for card making, and these have just the right width (3/8 inch) and are DOUBLE-SIDED. It really looks so much better when tying bows, if the ribbon is double-sided. It just doesn’t look tidy when the “bad side” of a one sided ribbon shows up after tying a bow. Other Positives: 1) The colors are vivid, there are 20 colors. Two of the colors are gold and silver. The gold and silver are shimmery and has a grosgrain look to it. 2) The ribbons have a smooth, satin finish to it. It is made of 100% polyester. Very easy to work with and making bows. The cut ends will fray. Sometimes I use a bit of glue on the ends to stop the fraying. 3) As soon as I saw all the colors, I thought of all the different cards I can make. Red ribbon for Valentine’s and Christmas, Orange and black for Halloween, blue for July 4th, etc. 4) Value priced, too at 48 cents a spool. There are 15 yards per roll for a total of 300 yards. This will last me a long time. These ribbons are great to have on hand for crafting, gift wrapping, or party events. I recommend them for value and quality."

I don’t need to pin it down while I’m making folds with my toes anymore! And can make a bow using two or three different kinds of ribbon with ease. I didn’t watch the included DVD yet, as I’ve seen these used on YouTube and it’s sort of easy to figure out -but I’d suggest watching it anyway. I could be doing it wrong:). First you put a chenille wire (or any type you prefer) into the groove. This contraption basically just pinches the ribbon while you make the folds. Then after you work your magic, just pull it out by your wire and twist. This is SO much faster than by hand, it is totally worth it. I designed a second holiday wreath just so I could use this more and will be making up reasons to give gifts to wrap all year.

I don’t need to pin it down while I’m making folds with my toes anymore! And can make a bow using two or three different kinds of ribbon with ease. I didn’t watch the included DVD yet, as I’ve seen these used on YouTube and it’s sort of easy to figure out -but I’d suggest watching it anyway. I could be doing it wrong:). First you put a chenille wire (or any type you prefer) into the groove. This contraption basically just pinches the ribbon while you make the folds. Then after you work your magic, just pull it out by your wire and twist. This is SO much faster than by hand, it is totally worth it. I designed a second holiday wreath just so I could use this more and will be making up reasons to give gifts to wrap all year. If you enjoy giftwrapping or crafting with bows, I very much recommend the Bow-Dabra.",

I found the exact brown deco mesh with copper threads on Amazon. This mesh I ordered, is such a better mesh then what I started with. When I cut the 10 by 10 pieces there was little to no fraying.

I bought two rolls for 10 yards total. When I took off the cellophane wrap I could see that the ribbon had a white (!) cloth backing and the nap of the velvet is a bubble gum pink and not the dusty rose depicted. The \"velvet\" is nothing like woven velvet of the quality you want to use for fabric sewing of any kind from dust covers, slip covers, to hair accessories and garments such as hats or dresses. Real velvet ribbon is going to be soft and floppy. This was clearly intended for gift wrapping purposes imho, as stiff as could be. I asked the seller about use for some slip covers so this was disappointing. Further, you really cannot 'tie' this ribbon, only use it flat: if using for gift wrap. Returning. The seller had me print a return label for postage paid shipping back via USPS for the mailman to pick up and that seems really convenient. I will update as to how the return/refund process goes with this seller. UPDATE: The seller did issue my refund. One extra star for that but this is not the quality ribbon that a real seamstress expects for sewing with fabrics for use in clothing or home decor items. Look at how stiff the bow is that another reviewer showed when used as gift wrap. It looked okay but I would not personally use it for gift wrap since you will only get a stiff bow."
