The old fashioned wooden spool only adds to the classic touch of its packaging. I plan to keep the spool in the future for other ribbons and threads.",
      "Thick ribbon|||B0CJDQP8CT ★★★★★ <b>Top shelf ribbon</b> I cannot say enough about this ribbon. I bought the spring green and fell in love. It’s thick, high quality velvet backed with glitter that does NOT come off. Came back to order more bc now I’m feeling FOMO😂✌️ buy the ribbon; it’s gorgeous!",

      "Thick ribbon|||B07JZJW4K3 ★★☆☆☆ <b>NOT 5 yards!!!</b> I absolutely loved the ribbon, it's beautiful, thick, satiny on both sides and a lovely color. I did not love that it's advertised as a five yard spool of ribbon and it's not! I ordered six spools and they were even labeled as \"5 yards\" with a sticker on the spool. It is NOT 5 yds. They are 3 yd. spools of ribbon. I thought I had ordered just enough and now I am very short!!! Not happy!",
      "stable, thick ribbon|||B0BNV7R9BM ★★★★★ <b>Dickes, glänzendes Satinband</b> Ich liebe es, Geschenke schön zu verpacken, weshalb ich mich sehr gefreut habe, dieses FAKILO Geschenkband mit einer Breite von 10cm und ca. 20m Länge testen zu dürfen. Es sieht genauso toll aus wie auf dem Produktfoto. Da es sich hierbei um Satinband handelt, ist es sehr glatt und glänzend. Ferner handelt es sich um ein stabiles, dickes Band, welches man sehr gut mit dem Bügeleisen zum Wiederbenutzen glätten kann, wenn man vorher einen festen Knoten gemacht hat. Da es als Rolle geliefert wurde, war es nicht zerknittert. Einen chemischen Geruch konnte ich ebenfalls nicht feststellen. Ich werde es nicht nur zum Verpacken von Geschenken benutzen, sondern auch damit basteln oder nähen. Das Band ist absolut empfehlenswert!",
      "Thick ribbon|||B0BYJRX8DJ ★★★★★ <b>Beautiful</b> This ribbon is the color shown on screen. It is soft, thick, and absolutely beautiful. It is not stiff so you can't make a bow for a gift but a single bow looks lovely. Would buy again.",

      "Thicker than cheaper ribbons|||B07DXFFBX8 ★★★★★ <b>Beautiful and Festive!</b> I was very pleased with these decorative embroidered ribbons. They are thicker than some cheaper ribbons and the quality is good. They can be used for any special occasion, but especially for holiday gifts. I would definitely buy these again. Just be aware that if you are twisting and tying the ribbons, you may have some glitter come off. But don’t let this deter you from buying them, as they look gorgeous!",

      "Thick nap|||B0C3SYDW7S ★★★★★ <b>Very nice quality ribbon</b> This velvet ribbon looks great. The nap is thick and a super rich black. The ribbon has good body for bows or jewelry and should make really nice chokers. This looks like a great trim for clothing and decor also. The price is ok, but there are better deals for similar quality if you look for them.",
      "nice thickness|||B09T6KX51F ★★★★★ <b>Love this ribbon</b> Purchased 1.5” Gold glitter wired ribbon from CT Crafts and was very pleased with the ribbon. The ribbon has a nice thickness, the glitter didn’t flake or fall off and the when formed, the ribbon held it’s shape. The wired edges are nicely sealed, so no wire poking out. The bow looked beautiful. I definitely recommend this product. I am planning on reordering this ribbon as well as the wider width.",
      "Thick ribbon|||B0BZPSYWHQ ★★★★★ <b>Great for mall packages</b> These were a little smaller than I expected but the quality is fabulous. The velvet material is soft and the ribbon is thick so you have to cut it, it will not break if you pull it tight. You could use these ribbons for crafts or for wrapping presents. They will make the most beautiful ribboned bows. I would recommend this set."

I make soap and bath bombs and need a high quality ribbon, to use to wrap the bath bombs, this is not it. I wanted to save some money this last time. So I when I ordered I decided to try this brand (it was half the price of my regular brand), what's the saying, you get what you pay for? This felt very much like the ribbon you get on commercial Easter baskets, that thin, one time use ribbon. Well that is not what I personally was looking for. I was looking for a good quality ribbon. I also found it harder to make bows with this ribbon because it had no body to it. All in all it was not the ribbon for me.",

It is a bright pure white (no ivory tint), has a very nice sheen on both sides. Very soft to the touch, smooth and supple just as you expect it should be. It came nicely packaged on a spool and wrapped in plastic so there are no stains or smudges whatsoever. There is on reason I couldn't give it 5 stars... My spool was not 50 continuous yards, but spliced together at least once. I haven't finished the spool yet so I am hoping there are no more splices as I need long sections of ribbon. I have less than 10 yards left. Fingers crossed. Keep that in mind though, if you need a full 50 yard piece or have long sections to cut. You may want to unspool the whole thing to plan your cuts according to any splices. Lucky for me, the splice was in a good place.",

      "Delicate and gauzy|||B0C33MW9CY ★★★★★ <b>Delicate, gauzy ribbons</b> As someone who gifts my handknits regularly, I tend to be very aware that whatever packaging I put things in just becomes clutter. I've taken to just wrapping blankets, sweaters, etc. in a ribbon for the presentation. This ribbon is quite beautiful. I choose a sage green, so that it's neutral on any gift. It's very delicate and the frayed edges look so pretty on packages. The ribbon is about 1.5 inches wide and 5 yards long per spool. (You get 4 spools in the package.) This means I can wrap quite a few packages in this ribbon. at 1.5 inches, I tend to use this for smaller packages, with thinner yarn. it's more of a summer wrap. Because the chiffon is thin, this is very gauzy, so be aware that it's not a robust, satiny ribbon. It's very very delicate. I like it a lot.",

      "Soft and supple|||B0BYJRX8DJ ★★★★★ <b>Lovely Ribbon and a Great Value</b> When I saw the Vitalizart white satin ribbon I immediately ordered it for holiday gift wrapping. Each year I craft homemade sauces, rubs, or other food gifts that I usually package in jars topped with a bit of colorful cloth. But when I ran out of narrow, delicate ribbon last year I was at a loss. Most traditional ribbon is either too thick or too stiff – or both – so it simply doesn’t work well for that type of task. This Vitalizart ribbon is practically perfect for my wrapping needs. It’s soft, supple, ties easily, and it stays in place. I think the small wooden spools are a lovely touch. They're so much classier than a cardboard spool – plus with the white ribbon they remind me of a little stack of double-stuffed Oreos. Cute! BOTTOM LINE: The Vitalizart satin ribbon is a well-made, quality product. And at a price-point of about $7 (at the time of this review), it’s an extremely good value for gift-wrap or crafting."

It was also a huge quantity for the money and very nice quality. It came spooled around a piece of foam which worked well. It does not have any wire to it and had a soft flowy feel instead. It is not glittery, but shiny and see-through. I found that it cut well with sharp fabric scissors that had not dulled on other things.

      "Rich and regal looking|||B06XKF3WS3 ★★★★★ <b>Great for Large Gifts</b> This ribbon was so easy to use-- the wires made it easy to manipulate and tweak the ribbon for the perfect poofiness in my pompom bow. I remember reading other reviews say the wire was on the thin side, but I actually preferred it like that because I could easily cut the ribbon with scissors and not pliers. The width of the 2.5 inch was just what I needed for a large box. The blue color is very rich and regal looking. I also got the 1.5\" in gold, and it looks as it should be, I just haven't gotten to use it yet. The amount of ribbon on each spool is a lot, so definitely worth the money to me. I didn't want to fear not having enough for my present or wrapping one single gift and not having enough for future gifts. The amount is also great because I want to practice my bows. I thought I would have to practice a lot, since it was my first time making a pompom bow, however, it was perfect on the first try.",

They measure 3/8” wide and 5 yards in length which is plenty for my purposes. The colors are exactly as they appeared on my screen and they remind me of vintage ribbons I have found in my grandmother’s sewing box. I’ve used this ribbon to hang Christmas ornaments on my tree, to tie around Christmas gifts and create sweet bows, and also for some sewing projects where I’m using these ribbons to embellish some clothes I’m making for my granddaughters. I recommend if you are considering purchasing this ribbon to pay attention to the measurements of this ribbon so you won’t be shocked when receiving a 3/8” wide ribbon! 😊I definitely recommend these ribbons.",

The ribbon is decent quality, although a bit thinner than I expected. For what I use it for though, that's a plus. The value is akin to big box craft store prices, unless you have a store coupon, which would make this a bit pricier. Overall, it's a fun assortment and is an excellent addition to my ribbon hoard.

      "Extremely thin|||B08P9NPY3P ★★☆☆☆ <b>EXTREMELY THIN AND NOT DOUBLE FACED</b> As the old adage goes, “You get what you pay for”, KINDA? VALUE: If this ribbon was going to the trash with wrapping paper, $4.99 for 100 yards is a good value. I’m giving the supplier credit that there actually are 100 yards on the roll. Unfortunately I bought this ribbon to serve as page markers for a Bible rebind. So, this ribbon is just too cheap looking and flimsy for that use. Value for me is zero. QUALITY: mediocre to poor, extremely thin material with almost invisible edge detail. PACKAGING: Unlike ribbon sold at brick and mortar stores, this roll came rolled around a core and in a cellophane envelope, but with no chip board sides to prevent the entire roll from falling off the sides of the core and totally tangling. PRODUCT LISTENING: Sold as Dark Red Double Faced Color is subjective but this roll of Dk Red appears to this purchaser to be closer to Light Red Wine in color. With a decidedly different texture on the reverse side, it is highly doubtful that this can be considered “Double Faced”. SUMMARY: If you are looking for ribbon for decoration, say for hair ribbons or seasonal decor, or for more permanent items like sewing into a dress or to make book markers, look elsewhere. If you only want to tie up a quick gift, or need wine colored string, go for it.",

It’s an odd, very thin material with the shiny surface on one side only. The back side is matte, but it also has significantly less color. It crushes easily and keeps those creases, so bow making is very tricky. One it has a crease, it’s there for good. It is a pretty color, though, so if you can use it without creasing it at all?

      "Thinner than craft store ribbon|||B0922M29Z4 ★★★☆☆ <b>The count came up short</b> This is the product you buy for the price and the quantity, not the quality. We all know it. So I was happy to see a pretty nice set of ribbons when I opened my Amazon box. The colors are vibrant, they were packaged very neatly, and the ribbon was rolled on a round piece of styrofoam. I compared the ribbon to some from the craft store and they are pretty close. This ribbon was a little thinner and the ribs were longer but they felt exactly the same. I’d pick this ribbon as it has the best price. Where the issues showed up were when I went to rewrap each of these onto the flat cardboard bobbins I prefer. I’ve included photos showing the things I found. The silver/grey had a defective area of about 5” right in the middle of the row. The peach/light coral one is two toned the entire length, with one edge much lighter than the other. Some of them, like the yellow are really kinked. I’m not sure how as they were rolled, but there are definitely distinct kinks there. I really hope they relax on their own as I don’t feel like fussing with them. Not a bad thing but you should know that the orange, lime green, and yellow are really neon color. Super bright. The biggest issue is the cut. Of the 24 rolls only 4 are the correct length. 12 rolls, half of the total number, are shorter than 4 yards each. The difference was 1.5 to 7 inches short each. A total of 39.25 inches were missing, more than a yard. The remaining 8 rolls were longer than 4 yards, with the same differences. Maybe they think it balances out? To me it didn’t matter as I have no set lengths I need. But to those of you looking for exactly 4 yards you should probably keep shopping. The ribbon wasn’t too stiff. It’s just like all the other grosgrain ribbon I have. I really do like colors, it’s a great selection. Even with the issues I’d buy this product again. It really is the best price.",
      "thin ribbon|||B0B46KYP47 ★★★☆☆ <b>Thin no give</b> Very thin like Paper.no give in it . Nasty paper cuts from it",
      "thin ribbon|||B09MBZC8Q8 ★★★☆☆ <b>Nice, with a couple of issues.</b> This ribbon looks nice enough if you just need something to use to hang thinga with, but I was disappointed for several reasons. The first is my fault: I really didn't do the math well when I ordered this, and I just didn't realize how short a length I would get off each color. Some of these colors are gorgeous, but others I know I'm unlikely to use again. That tends to mean the colors I don't like will pile up, if I try to re-purchase more of the ones I do like - and that will happen quickly, with only 1 yard of each color. I really, really hate the way these were packed. The product picture shows each color rolled separately, but that's not what you get. Instead, you get about a half-dozen large rolls, which contain multiple colors. Without unrolling each one, it's impossible to see what's there. Because of this before I could even use the ribbon, I spent an hour and a half unrolling the big rolls and making small, individual rolls with each color. After that, I can see and access them all easily. But honestly, I really had much better things to do with my time than repack 30 yards of ribbon. The quality isn't bad. I had hoped for thicker ribbon, as I planned to use these to make necklaces and I want them to last. A thicker pile to the ribbon would prevent it from wrinkling too easily, and would keep it from looking prematurely worn. Anything I make from these, I will have to charge a bit less for and warn customers that the necklace cord will eventually wear out. What I do like: many of these colors are stunning. It is nice to have a sampler to allow me to figure out what I need most. I really hope that they hold up better than I am expecting. Time will tell. If all you need is ribbons for trim, or to hang ornaments from, these are a good choice. I think, however, they for my purposes, I am going to have to keep looking for higher quality.",
      "horribly thin|||B0C7GVWJ4T ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Poor quality</b> Paid $17 plus tax for three yards of some horribly thin translucent ribbon. I ordered extra stuff so as to get the item overnight, I was that desperate. Project had to be completed & what I had just wasn’t enough so I used this horrible stuff anyway. I hated the idea but it was done & now out of my hands. So disappointed because I don’t do subpar work!!! Wow! All that to say expensive poor quality item! Sorry!",
      "thinner and less opaque than expected|||B0CJ286HCC ★★★★☆ <b>Slight More Orange Toned, Thinner Than Expected</b> PROS: - It is a lovely ribbon on both sides; the main is the velvet, and the reverse is a cream backing, so it can pull double duty and I worry less about laying it perfectly. - It comes pinned, not taped, which is a small but appreciated thing for me. NEUTRALS: - The ribbons are a bit thinner than I expected; most of my velvet ribbons are completely opaque, but these you are able to see your finger through if you’re holding it. Since I’m just using this for wrapping and small designs, it’s not a major issue for me personally. CONS: - The ribbon is both lighter and more orange toned than it appeared in the listing images (I checked it under different light sources). I would call it a brown orange over a khaki for sure. - The ends fray if you don’t use incredibly sharp shears. DIRECTLY GIFTABLE?: Sure, it’s just a plain white ribbon wheel, wrapped in plastic. Nothing notable really. CONCLUSION: - It’s a nice ribbon, but the color and fray potential is why it still landed at four stars for me. I wouldn’t go out of my way to recommend it, but I wouldn’t advise against it either.",

Really liked the pure gold ones but again the glitter is so bad. Had to wrap the presents in the garage and shake them a few times to try to get most of the glitter off. The 2 that had designs look and feel cheap. They have a thin plastic feel to them and they are see through. So out of 4 rolls I will only be using the 2 pure gold ones. The other 2 will go to the trash unfortunately. I will not be ordering again.

It is not glittery, but shiny and see-through. I found that it cut well with sharp fabric scissors that had not dulled on other things.

The 5/8 inch width is just what I wanted to \"finish\" the ornament. I have used Micoman Gingham ribbon for two years, and always order several rolls for the holiday season. Very happy with this product and it's a good value for the price.",

When I want to give ‘thank you’ cash to mail person, UPS, FedEx, Amazon drivers, recycle and landfill and yard waste bin pick-up people, etc., I tape a length of this narrow ribbon inside each holiday card and tie it around the bills I’ve folded to fit. Thus makes me sound like Lady Bountiful on Boxing Day, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. I’m a wage slave, too, I just feel better saying ‘thanks’ to the people who help out all year, especially in these crazy times, even if it means I need to skip drive-throughs and lattes-to-go for several weeks.

The ribbon was literally delivered in a ball (pic of that uploaded) and I have to unwind then untwist it to get it to lay straight, so I docked a star for this huge annoyance for me.",
      "Delivered in a ball shape|||B0C1NDVVRZ ★★★☆☆ <b>Low quality and doesn't lay flat</b> I purchased this as a replacement to a similar ribbon from Hobby Lobby. The quality is sub-par at best. It feels cheap and since it is wrapped in a ball, it is hard to make the ribbon lay flat. I will not purchase again.",
      "Delivered in a ball shape|||B0C1NDVVRZ ★★☆☆☆ <b>Smaller than appears/hard to unroll!</b> First off, this product is WAY smaller than anticipated. I'm usually pretty good at paying attention to details, but I may have just missed the mark on this one. No one in my family can find where this product begins on the roll, which is super frustrating! I put it at the back of my gift wrapping supplies until I feel like I want to tackle it again, or just cut it at some random spot to start using."

Based on the picture, I thought they came in rolls but they actually come in twist ties. I might have expected more length for each ribbon and frankly, I didn't search for lengths in the product description and went with the picture envisioning each was a separate roll. With that said, once I got over the packaging, each one was fun to use. The variety is what I liked the most. If you need lengthy ribbons, you might need a supplement or other ribbons to add to your wrapping assortment. I had a wide lengthy roll that I used as my primary one, and I used these to add accents."

The only downside is that the color isn't as bright as I had hoped. It's not exactly like the product images. It's not necessarily gold, but it's also not a bright sunshine yellow as pictured. It's more of a muted sunshine yellow if that makes any sense at all. It's not pale, and it's not a dark gold, it's just a more subdued sunny yellow. The color really is pretty.

Ich werde es mir für besondere Geschenke zurücklegen. Ein kleiner Tipp von mir: Wenn man so ein schönes Band mehrfach verwenden möchte (für Weihnachtsdeko z.B.), dann kann man Knicke und Falten ganz einfach wegbügeln, wenn man das Bügeleisen auf ganz schwache Hitze stellt.

      "double-sided|||B09XM6ZN1Q ★★★★★ <b>Very Pretty Ribbons in Lots of Colors</b> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these 20 ribbons of 20 different colors. I like to use ribbons for card making, and these have just the right width (3/8 inch) and are DOUBLE-SIDED. It really looks so much better when tying bows, if the ribbon is double-sided. It just doesn’t look tidy when the “bad side” of a one sided ribbon shows up after tying a bow. Other Positives: 1) The colors are vivid, there are 20 colors. Two of the colors are gold and silver. The gold and silver are shimmery and has a grosgrain look to it. 2) The ribbons have a smooth, satin finish to it. It is made of 100% polyester. Very easy to work with and making bows. The cut ends will fray. Sometimes I use a bit of glue on the ends to stop the fraying. 3) As soon as I saw all the colors, I thought of all the different cards I can make. Red ribbon for Valentine’s and Christmas, Orange and black for Halloween, blue for July 4th, etc. 4) Value priced, too at 48 cents a spool. There are 15 yards per roll for a total of 300 yards. This will last me a long time. These ribbons are great to have on hand for crafting, gift wrapping, or party events. I recommend them for value and quality.",

I do wedding photography and use the ribbons when styling a lay flat which is usually of the wedding couples’ details. Ya, brides don’t provide those things so we bring them lol. I also photograph newborns and milestones and these ribbons would really well for tiebacks and headbands that we make custom for our client closets. I love creating delicate outfits and accessories for my sweet little babies. The color is definitely a chocolate shade of champagne but very pretty.

It creates amazing interest when trailing through a photo of an invitation suite or curled around the wedding rings. The ribbon actually appears 2-sided. One side is clearly shiny, the other is more matte. The fraying is natural, but tidy. My favorite part of this set, though, is the inclusion of the spools!! I’ve been hoping to add spools to my detail kit… and here they are! They are also the perfect size. Enough to add pop and interest to a picture, but not so large or bulky to take away from the actual bridal details themselves. My only wish would be to have the option to mix and match colors. Since this ribbon is not for a specific craft or one-use project in my case, I would prefer a choice of colors rather than 3 spools of the same color. But, I’d still buy another Vitalizart set. The gray/silver is beautiful, and the price for their spooled ribbon is very affordable.",

If the length is actually 100 yards, it's very reasonable. At the time of this review this product 1/8th inch wide, black satin, two sided ribbon. Smooth and shiny on both sides. This is a delicate, yet strong, slim and pretty ribbon that can be used for so many purposes. For me, I am making bracelets and necklaces and am making display and creative textiles, and fabric cord details to replace traditional chains. I'll update with more information as I use it, but for 100 yards, this is a reasonable value that includes the cost of shipping.

The prints are only on one side (except the red and black gingham, that is the same on both sides) and that is not a problem at all as most ribbon is that way, just wanted to mention that.

It is somewhat shinier on one side which I love. The only 2 things I didn't like were: 1. even cutting the ends on an angle, it can still sometimes fray. 2.

It came nicely packaged on a spool and wrapped in plastic so there are no stains or smudges whatsoever. There is on reason I couldn't give it 5 stars... My spool was not 50 continuous yards, but spliced together at least once. I haven't finished the spool yet so I am hoping there are no more splices as I need long sections of ribbon. I have less than 10 yards left. Fingers crossed. Keep that in mind though, if you need a full 50 yard piece or have long sections to cut.

The gold is a beautiful rich gold, not yellow gold, more like an old gold, not mustard or dark or champagne. Just a perfect gold. I definitely recommend this ribbon. I used it for making my wedding invitations and the color matched back to my envelopes perfectly. It is not shiny, but there is a nice satin sheen to it.",

I measured the fire engine red at 4 yards, and even the white which looked to be the most ample was 6 inches short of 5 yards. Truth in advertising is not always a requirement for these products.

It’s an odd, very thin material with the shiny surface on one side only. The back side is matte, but it also has significantly less color. It crushes easily and keeps those creases, so bow making is very tricky. One it has a crease, it’s there for good. It is a pretty color, though, so if you can use it without creasing it at all?

      "Patterns printed on one side only|||B0C8HLJZ78 ★★★★★ <b>Good crafting assortment</b> These 20 small rolls came in a flat box of assorted colors and patterns. Since the rolls are so well assorted I'll be using them when I make small craft items for elementary school children this holiday season. They're perfect for that as most children like whatever craft I make for them to look just a little bit different than the one their classmates have. The patterns on the ribbon are very cute but are only printed on one side. The ribbon does have a nice feel and weight to it however. What I also like to do when using ribbon with a patten on it that says things like on this ribbon -- Merry Christmas, Let it snow, and Ho-ho-ho -- is to use a small piece of it inside a small mass of curly ribbon for a package bow. It makes a super cute presentation and is a nice touch.",

      "one side more shiny satin than the other|||B08M5QMQLP ★★★☆☆ <b>Cheaper ribbon, but great quantity for the price.</b> I bought this product to use for multiple projects, and so far it has served its purpose well. One thing that I noticed immediately about the product was the packaging. It comes on a styrofoam spool with no ridges to hold it in place. I find it near impossible to store, and even more impossible to wrap the excess up when I am done using it. If the ribbon came on a cardboard spool with edges to keep it in place, I might have given this product another star. This might not be something that bothers anyone else, but if you are looking to store it and use it on multiple different projects, I suggest finding a different spool to store the ribbon on. Other than that, the ribbon was of decent quality. As I said, you get great yardage for the price, but the ribbon does feel a bit cheaper. There is one side that is clearly a more shiny satin than the other. Additionally, the ribbon is a bit see-through. Further, when cut with scissors, the ribbon almost immediately frays, as seen in the attached photos. This is a problem with any ribbon but was especially noticeable with this one. I have yet to attempt to seal it with a lighter, but I am not sure how well that would work as the ribbon immediately disintegrates into a million strings after you cut it. Overall, if you are looking to do a project that requires a large amount of ribbon and you aren't too worried about the quality, then I suggest this product. But, if you are looking for ribbon to use throughout multiple projects, or want a nicer quality ribbon, then I suggest you look elsewhere.",

The ribbon is just the right width for these types of shots: not too thin or too wide. It creates amazing interest when trailing through a photo of an invitation suite or curled around the wedding rings. The ribbon actually appears 2-sided. One side is clearly shiny, the other is more matte. The fraying is natural, but tidy. My favorite part of this set, though, is the inclusion of the spools!! I’ve been hoping to add spools to my detail kit… and here they are! They are also the perfect size. Enough to add pop and interest to a picture, but not so large or bulky to take away from the actual bridal details themselves. My only wish would be to have the option to mix and match colors. Since this ribbon is not for a specific craft or one-use project in my case, I would prefer a choice of colors rather than 3 spools of the same color. But, I’d still buy another Vitalizart set.

      "Beautiful shade of gold - quite elegant, not \"loud\"|||B08BLFJPSF ★★★★☆ <b>Good quality. Lovely shade of gold.</b> Beautiful shade of gold - quite elegant, not \"loud\". Good quality. But overpriced. If buying in quantity view it as a long-term investment. I recommend reading the product title extra carefully as it's the product description. One reviewer complains it's not curling ribbon, but it doesn't say it's curling ribbon and you can tell it's not curling ribbon from the advert photo. It is \"gift-wrapping\" ribbon, as per the description, in that you wrap it around the gift and/or tie a bow to embellish. Bought to: 1. Wrap around homemade gatefold greeting cards (as the kind of 'belly band' you untie). 2. Make ribbon bows to embellish greeting cards. 3. Sew in inside a greeting card the paper to write on and sign. Impressive for little effort and so better than glue. This ribbon glues well, using high-tack glue, hold the bits together (or use a clip) for a while afterwards though. The gold colour will look great on Christmas cards. I came here to order more in case it becomes unavailable, and to consider other colours, because with scores to make I'll start making them soon (I know people who've already started).

I wanted something that looked more luxe - like the real silk ribbons I reserve for very special occasions and bridal floral bouquets… just with less of a hefty price tag as silk can get too pricey for gift wrapping. This is a nice solution and definitely costs less. It looks and feels a lot like silk, and the frayed edges give it a delicate handmade quality. I bought the rose gold color and it’s absolutely gorgeous. A very versatile color, it goes with many color schemes and looks high end, instantly elevating the gift wrapping. Highly recommend!",

      "pure gold color|||B0B8YC2J1Q ★★☆☆☆ <b>Mixed feelings about this ribbon a bit cheap. 2 of the 4 rolls are usable</b> I have mixed feelings about this ribbon. First I will say do not buy it if you don’t like glitter. You will have glitter everywhere. I don’t mind a little glitter but these ribbons have way too much and it sheds a lot. The designs are cute. Really liked the pure gold ones but again the glitter is so bad. Had to wrap the presents in the garage and shake them a few times to try to get most of the glitter off. The 2 that had designs look and feel cheap. They have a thin plastic feel to them and they are see through. So out of 4 rolls I will only be using the 2 pure gold ones. The other 2 will go to the trash unfortunately. I will not be ordering again. Honestly I’ve really had no luck finding decent ribbon online for wrapping gifts and making bows. if you want good quality ribbon you have to go to a craft store or one of the clubs."

      "Glittery|||B07DXFFBX8 ★★★★★ <b>Beautiful and Festive!</b> I was very pleased with these decorative embroidered ribbons. They are thicker than some cheaper ribbons and the quality is good. They can be used for any special occasion, but especially for holiday gifts. I would definitely buy these again. Just be aware that if you are twisting and tying the ribbons, you may have some glitter come off. But don’t let this deter you from buying them, as they look gorgeous!",

      "Glittery|||B0B7J4XB25 ★★★★★ <b>Looks beautiful on Christmas tree</b> Bought the gold pack of 3 for around £15 to use on my 7ft artificial tree. The ribbon sheds a fair amount of glitter and gets everywhere a bit so be mindful of that, but the ribbon is still sparkly on the tree. I used two strands from two rolls to go around my 7ft tree which is approx 130cm wide. I used two strands so that I would have the desired gap between layers at my desired angle all the way around the tree. It looks lovely and much nicer than tinsel. This was the only wide ribbon I could find online in the UK. The last photo is to show how much ribbon was used to achieve the look I did, the roll on the left is unopened, and the other two rolls are the rolls I took my two strands from (I didn’t use strands from the same roll incase the roll ran out mid second-strand) I recommend the product.",

The main con is the fact that glitter falls everywhere but this is something that should be obvious given all the designs are done in glitter. The second con is that they aren't very easy to manipulate because they are very stiff. Making bows out them wasn't that easy depending on the fabric and stiffness.

      "Glittery|||B07TSJ7QLB ★★★★☆ <b>Nice ribbon, as advertised</b> Glitter will get loose! But it's otherwise nice little ribbon. Does have minimal bending application, wires on the edges, so you can shape it how you want. It appears to be 36 yards total, which is 108 ft for those who don't feel like doing the math. More ribbon than i needed to decorate my tree, i have loads left over.",

Really liked the pure gold ones but again the glitter is so bad. Had to wrap the presents in the garage and shake them a few times to try to get most of the glitter off. The 2 that had designs look and feel cheap. They have a thin plastic feel to them and they are see through. So out of 4 rolls I will only be using the 2 pure gold ones.

It just doesn’t look tidy when the “bad side” of a one sided ribbon shows up after tying a bow. Other Positives: 1) The colors are vivid, there are 20 colors. Two of the colors are gold and silver. The gold and silver are shimmery and has a grosgrain look to it. 2) The ribbons have a smooth, satin finish to it. It is made of 100% polyester. Very easy to work with and making bows. The cut ends will fray. Sometimes I use a bit of glue on the ends to stop the fraying. 3) As soon as I saw all the colors, I thought of all the different cards I can make. Red ribbon for Valentine’s and Christmas, Orange and black for Halloween, blue for July 4th, etc. 4) Value priced, too at 48 cents a spool. There are 15 yards per roll for a total of 300 yards. This will last me a long time. These ribbons are great to have on hand for crafting, gift wrapping, or party events. I recommend them for value and quality.",

      "Satiny and smooth texture|||B07X9K54CH ★★★★★ <b>Nice satin ribbon</b> I sew for a living. Doll dresses. So I know a good satin ribbon when I see it. This is great for the money. Sure, there’s better ribbon in the world, but it’s pricey. This stuff is good double sided ribbon and nobody is ever gonna know you paid very little and it’s not from a fabric store. It’s very nice to the touch, not paper-like at all. You’ll love it."

But vibrant colors</b> The colors are vibrant, and the ribbon is a nice thick quality, but unlike other buyers who were pictured here , my ribbon DIDNT COME ROLLED. Instead it came crimped with those horrible little wired bread ties which leaves a forever mark in velvet; so not all 36” is usable. That having been said, the colors of this lot were as follows: the navy was deep - almost black. The emerald green was spot on old fashioned green (think beleek) and the forest green is deep and rich. The blue is a robins egg, not a teal as in many of the pics. The gray is a pigeon color, and the yellow is a rich warm marigold. The maroon is a rich garnet, and the peach is a true baby peach. As for the pinks: the pale is a true baby girl pink, the hot pink is somewhere between Barbie pink and strawberry, and the red is a cool true red. The purple however is not a royal rich purple. It is more like a vibrant joyful lilac - very eastery. Hope this helps anyone wondering about colors !",

The other is a ribbed, satiny texture. Because it isn't wide, it's easy to tie and wrap with, and it looks delicate and tasteful.

I actually thought it was wider and bigger and was surprised at how small the spools are, but that’s because I didn’t really look at the measurements when I ordered. So if you are looking for a specific size or need a lot, make sure to look at the description. This ended up being perfect for what I wanted!",

It looked good in a bow on this year's Christmas wreath, to. If you are looking for luxury ribbon at a value price, this would be the one. The burgundy suede velvet is my third Ribbon Traditions purchase. I definitely recommend the brand.",

They have a matte look to them which is perfect when you want something to accent the details of a wedding rather than take away from them. These would be great for any crafts and for wrapping wedding bouquets as well"

It is has a thinner hand than Offray with a somewhat paper-like quality and lacks the luster of the more expensive ribbons. Still, though, it has a very pleasing sheen and is an excellent choice for beautiful wrapping and crafts. One note: The sage color I purchased was a gray green.

So, I don't know if more of the roll is taped together. It doesn't matter if it is or it isn't. I will not buy this brand of ribbon again."

Pretty easy to do and this material was perfect for the harsh outside weather. It has a velvety feel which makes it look expensive. After 2.5 months outside, it didn't lose even a bit of its color, and I kept the ribbon to reattempt the next year as well.

The color of the Vatin ribbon is gorgeous and the feel is plush with a good drape for the weight. The color saturation is to die for.

The ribbon itself was lovely and soft. Even my husband liked the feel of the velvet. I look forward to using this ribbon in projects in the future. Ribbon, lace and thread are supplies that I keep on hand so I can make projects without running to the store. Our nearest fabric store being a 42 mile round trip. This velvet ribbon will also be useful when making fancy cards. I appreciate the opportunity to try these out. Thank you.",

It feels soft and luxurious; it’s easy to use, especially for gift wrapping with wax seals.

The quality of this ribbon is excellent and the ribbon was very easy to work with and tie into a bow. I added a photo of how I used it to embellish an altered book. I think it really softened the look of my project and I just love it. I look forward to using this in my ribbon flags, the frayed edges will add such a nice look and some dimension. There are so many uses for this ribbon from crafting, hair bows, or simply just embellishing wrapped gifts and packages.

Since the rolls are so well assorted I'll be using them when I make small craft items for elementary school children this holiday season. They're perfect for that as most children like whatever craft I make for them to look just a little bit different than the one their classmates have. The patterns on the ribbon are very cute but are only printed on one side. The ribbon does have a nice feel and weight to it however. What I also like to do when using ribbon with a patten on it that says things like on this ribbon -- Merry Christmas, Let it snow, and Ho-ho-ho -- is to use a small piece of it inside a small mass of curly ribbon for a package bow. It makes a super cute presentation and is a nice touch.",

With the large assortment of Christmas colors and designs you get in this package (and I like them all), I was able to find a nice match for every Christmas paper I have. Only thing I don’t like is that they aren’t on a spool, so I have a rather large mess of different ribbons now sitting in my wrapping bag, but these are cloth and don’t tangle up tightly together, so they are easy to separate when you want to use again. These ribbons were all I needed this year for all my Christmas wrapping.",

Bows are softer than with wired ribbon or pre-made bows, but they pack up in the car better for the holiday parties and don't arrive squished. The silver grey color compliments both kraft and shiny papers and is easy to work with. Tie around a wrapped box, tuck in a sprig of rosemary or pine, and it looks very classy in less time than it takes to peel the paper backing off a stick on bow."

      "White cloth backing|||B0BKR6C7JF ★★☆☆☆ <b>Suitable for gift wrap only. Color not true to photo</b> I received the product quickly to my mail box. I bought two rolls for 10 yards total. When I took off the cellophane wrap I could see that the ribbon had a white (!) cloth backing and the nap of the velvet is a bubble gum pink and not the dusty rose depicted. The \"velvet\" is nothing like woven velvet of the quality you want to use for fabric sewing of any kind from dust covers, slip covers, to hair accessories and garments such as hats or dresses. Real velvet ribbon is going to be soft and floppy. This was clearly intended for gift wrapping purposes imho, as stiff as could be. I asked the seller about use for some slip covers so this was disappointing. Further, you really cannot 'tie' this ribbon, only use it flat: if using for gift wrap. Returning. The seller had me print a return label for postage paid shipping back via USPS for the mailman to pick up and that seems really convenient. I will update as to how the return/refund process goes with this seller. UPDATE: The seller did issue my refund. One extra star for that but this is not the quality ribbon that a real seamstress expects for sewing with fabrics for use in clothing or home decor items. Look at how stiff the bow is that another reviewer showed when used as gift wrap. It looked okay but I would not personally use it for gift wrap since you will only get a stiff bow."

      "muted colors|||B0BZPSYWHQ ★★★★★ <b>Just what I was looking for</b> I purchased these to use at Christmas. I always put up several trees throughout our house and the one in our great room is decorated in a woodland theme, as is the entire room. These colors fit perfectly with the more muted color scheme I’m going with this year. I thought I would be ordering separate rolls of ribbon so I was pleasantly surprised to find this package of three in colors that will work well with my theme. I plan to use them mainly in decor but if any is left over, I see them working perfectly on packages. The quality appears to be good."

      "Less structured than other satin ribbons|||B0C7V2QHNM ★★★★☆ <b>Romantic</b> If it's possible to care about ribbon, I am among those who do. This ribbon I wanted to try to see if it \"behaved\" like other satin ribbon I have used that were a comparable width. Turns out this ribbon is softer and less structured than the other satins I have used. Not saying that is a bad thing, it's more of a style thing. This ribbon will produce more romantic looking bows. They will be flowy. I loved the color which will lend itself to school colors. It is super soft and cut easily. I like to add little touches of ribbon when I decorate and this will work for that as well. The burnt orange is also an awesome Autumn tone. Love it!"

Just added a photo of the super easy garland I’m making with this beautiful tulle. It’s a great no sew project that is fun for the kids too. Just cut desired length of garland from pretty ribbon. Than cut the tulle into approximately 4” wide pieces, and tie onto the ribbon, putting each closely together on the ribbon. No need to tie in a knot, just tie once ((like you do when tying shoe laces), just be sure to cinch tightly. Same technique as for making a rag garland."

The edges on the 5/8” were brownish and the texture was different. It also did not come taped or wrapped like the others.",
      "beautiful sage green|||B0BC4DQG41 ★★★☆☆ <b>Disappointed in the quality</b> This ribbon is a beautiful sage green color (matches David’s Bridal dusty sage and Azazie agave colors). I bought it for wedding favors, but I’m very disappointed in the quality. The ribbon is wrinkled from the way it is rolled on the Styrofoam. Ironing it flattens it out, but I shouldn’t have to iron 150 feet of ribbon straight off the roll before I can use it! Also, on some of the ribbon the edge crimping was out of alignment and not actually on the edge (shown on the top ribbon in the 3rd picture). I can’t use the parts of the roll with defects like this. I will add, though, that I did end up talking to their customer support, and I must say that they do have great customer service!",
      "Forest green (deep and rich)|||B07RT1Q1DM ★★★☆☆ <b>Ugh - Twist Ties !!! But vibrant colors</b> The colors are vibrant, and the ribbon is a nice thick quality, but unlike other buyers who were pictured here , my ribbon DIDNT COME ROLLED. Instead it came crimped with those horrible little wired bread ties which leaves a forever mark in velvet; so not all 36” is usable. That having been said, the colors of this lot were as follows: the navy was deep - almost black. The emerald green was spot on old fashioned green (think beleek) and the forest green is deep and rich. The blue is a robins egg, not a teal as in many of the pics. The gray is a pigeon color, and the yellow is a rich warm marigold. The maroon is a rich garnet, and the peach is a true baby peach. As for the pinks: the pale is a true baby girl pink, the hot pink is somewhere between Barbie pink and strawberry, and the red is a cool true red. The purple however is not a royal rich purple. It is more like a vibrant joyful lilac - very eastery. Hope this helps anyone wondering about colors !",

      "vibrant green|||B08M5QMQLP ★★★★☆ <b>Pretty color, very cheap material, color bleeds</b> Ok for what it is. The color is a very vibrant green, but the fabric is really cheap. It’s OK for crafts, but I don’t think it would be suitable for any type of sewing project, as the color bleeds when wet and it’s not really a satin. It’s an odd, very thin material with the shiny surface on one side only. The back side is matte, but it also has significantly less color. It crushes easily and keeps those creases, so bow making is very tricky. One it has a crease, it’s there for good. It is a pretty color, though, so if you can use it without creasing it at all? It should work for crafts.",

It's strips of velvet fabric cut into ribbons with raw edges. It is a thinner material (you can see light through it if you hold it up to the light), but that also makes it much softer and more \"flowy\" than other velvet ribbons. The green color is a dark evergreen and is perfect for Christmas. Keep in mind, since it's more like a raw cut fabric rather than a traditional ribbon, it does fray on the cut end.",

I love the frayed edges for a more rustic, natural, farmhouse sort of vibe, but if you don’t like frayed edges and want something neater, this isn’t the choice for you.

She’s keeping it to wrap gifts she gives to others! The soft sage matched the wrapping paper perfectly, and the “eyelash” threads looked great with the woodland print.

It's very delicate and the frayed edges look so pretty on packages. The ribbon is about 1.5 inches wide and 5 yards long per spool. (You get 4 spools in the package.) This means I can wrap quite a few packages in this ribbon. at 1.5 inches, I tend to use this for smaller packages, with thinner yarn. it's more of a summer wrap. Because the chiffon is thin, this is very gauzy, so be aware that it's not a robust, satiny ribbon. It's very very delicate. I like it a lot.",

Still, though, it has a very pleasing sheen and is an excellent choice for beautiful wrapping and crafts. One note: The sage color I purchased was a gray green.

I ordered this in yellow and the color is bright and true to the listing. The edges are finished securely but still very flexible and drape nicely. I’m going to use this to tie sunflowers 🌻 for my wedding bouquet! 💐",

      "no frayed sides|||B07PLS3GGV ★★★★★ <b>Absolutely Beautiful!</b> I decided to try something new with my Christmas tree this year, so I bought the Champagne Gold ribbon. It's even more beautiful in person than what you see in the pics. Excellent quality with no frayed sides. The wires allow it to stay in whatever position you want. It's slightly sheer without being too sheer, so it will stand out on the tree. It sparkles and shimmers in the original packaging. I can only imagine what it will look like reflecting the lights on my tree this year. I highly recommend!",

Candles were easy to install batteries and use remote. They look really nice and I like the real wax feel. The top edge is not straight hard line making them appear a bit used which is fun and a little theatrical. I picked these because of the remote and timer which works well- and I was able to put them on a high shelf and use the remote to turn them on.",

There are no end shredding or stray threads. I personally like wired ribbons because it stays in the shape you want it to, especially bows. I will use this mostly for gift wrapping as I have a lot of blue Christmas wrappings from a clearance purchase 2 years ago. Do not limit this ribbon to wrappings, it's perfect for decor bows, add to garland, a ribbon that goes around a tree or placed downwards. To get a nice curl roll the ribbon from the bottom up and once in position unroll it. Great ribbon",

Depending on what you’re using it for just a little heads up. I love the unfinished edges, give’s it a unique look. The red is that beautiful Christmas red. Looks so plush and can’t wait to see it with wrapping paper! Absolutely beautiful and worth the price it’s listed for!"

      "edges catch on everything|||B0BX9L46K9 ★★★★★ <b>Perfect color - annoying to use</b> I thought from the listing images it might be a bit too brightly colored for my purpose but it was absolutely perfect once I got it unwrapped, it really is much more of a pastel color scheme than it may seem. I needed something to kind of fill in gaps and make my candy/sweets/candyland tree look more full and this worked perfectly. I had enough with one and a little bit of another to do my 6 foot tree in 3 full length sections and 3 half length sections. The only downside to this stuff is the edges are really weird and like to catch on EVERYTHING! So working with it it kept catching my shirt and branches and I’d have to pull it to get it free and it would mess up what I had pulled into the tree already. May just be how this stuff is but I don’t know because this is my first time using stuff like this so I figured I’d throw that warning out there.",

The color is exactly as pictured on the photo. It’s a nice shiny “old gold” color that will be prefect for holiday vibes without being Christmas theme. It’s a nice soft pliable ribbon that is easy to shape and tie so it works perfect for my use. It’s also the perfect size for small bows for a little pop of color on holiday presents. My only complaint is that it tends to fray where it is cut. This is fixed by using a lighter to melt the ends and stop the fraying. Overall I think it’s a good quality for the cheap price since and you get a lot of ribbon for your money. I would recommend.",

This is a fairly priced set of ribbon given what I’ve seen locally, and there are a good range of colors including the darker red, which I have yet to see in person. I haven’t worked with much deco ribbon in the past but this seems to unravel a bit more than I would have hoped for. I need to use some tape/glue mixture on the ends to help stopgap the problem before weaving it in and out. I’m not sure if a project involving lots of smaller pieces would be possible with this ribbon given the fraying.",

      "frayed edges|||B0BD8BZKKV ★★★★★ <b>Gorgeous vintage style ribbon</b> I ordered this ribbon for holiday decorating. It’s soft, delicately frayed at the edges and a beautiful, rich green. I could see this tied to a wreath or used on packages. I was very impressed with the quality and plan to order more in other colors. Very nice.",
      "Frayed edges|||B0CBPG8CWC ★★★★★ <b>Polyester Ribbon</b> This poly ribbon came in a cute box and wrapped on 3 little wooden spools. Ribbon has a smoother side and a more textured side. I like the frayed edges because it matches my project. I needed the strength of polyester to double up, making a light strap. Easy to work with, true to color, takes a hot iron easily.",
      "Organic edge with intentional fraying|||B0C7V2QHNM ★★★★☆ <b>Holiday garland</b> ribbon was what was looking for, feels like silk- organic edge, intentional fraying- used on Holiday tree. ribbon most “delicate” - frayed edge kept “catching” on tree… so micro treads trailed ribbon. looks pretty, but ribbon too fragile to expect i’ll be able to “re-use” next year.",
      "Frayed edges|||B0C33MW9CY ★★★★★ <b>Really nice!</b> The quality is great and the colors are perfect for a Fourth of July or patriotic themed craft, which is what my wife will be working on. Also great for wrapping packages. The texture of the ribbon along with the frayed edges give a really nice touch. Just wish the spools were a little longer!",
      "Frayed edges|||B0BWF4SJ1T ★★★★★ <b>Pretty color</b> Soft, muted color, perfect for wrapping a gift or using on your craft. The frayed edges are a nice touch to the design. The outer fabric of the ribbon has a nice sheen. I like this product and consider it a good value.",

      "Nicely frayed edges|||B0C7V2QHNM ★★★★★ <b>Beautiful ribbon. Nicely frayed. Love the spools for bridal detail photos.</b> I will be using this ribbon for bridal/wedding detail photos. The ribbon is just the right width for these types of shots: not too thin or too wide. It creates amazing interest when trailing through a photo of an invitation suite or curled around the wedding rings. The ribbon actually appears 2-sided. One side is clearly shiny, the other is more matte. The fraying is natural, but tidy. My favorite part of this set, though, is the inclusion of the spools!! I’ve been hoping to add spools to my detail kit… and here they are! They are also the perfect size. Enough to add pop and interest to a picture, but not so large or bulky to take away from the actual bridal details themselves. My only wish would be to have the option to mix and match colors. Since this ribbon is not for a specific craft or one-use project in my case, I would prefer a choice of colors rather than 3 spools of the same color. But, I’d still buy another Vitalizart set. The gray/silver is beautiful, and the price for their spooled ribbon is very affordable.",
      "Frayed edges|||B0C5ZT8YQG ★★★★☆ <b>Looks nice enough</b> The color of this ribbon is vibrant and clear, which I love. The edges fray as the ribbon is handled, which gives it a sortof undone, casual, whimsical look. The two rolls came in a little box and are fastened with straight pins--there's no spool or anything that the ribbon is wrapped around. There's also not a ton of it, which I probably should have anticipated looking at the images. Overall, it'll do.",
      "frayed edges|||B0C33MW9CY ★★★★★ <b>Sheer sage green frayed edge chiffon ribbon</b> I’ll be using this sheer sage green frayed edge chiffon ribbon on the dresses I’ll be making for my granddaughters to wear as flower girls at an upcoming wedding. The color is true to its name, the edges are lightly frayed, and each roll looks uniform. I’ve purchased this ribbon in other colors to use when wrapping gifts. The recipients all commented on the pretty ribbons and it brought joy to their hearts. I recommend this ribbon",

      "frayed edges|||B0BWF4SJ1T ★★★★★ <b>Beautiful hunter green!</b> This chiffon ribbon is so pretty! I love the deep hunter green color which is perfect for my friend’s wedding coming up! I ordered this to wrap her gift in her wedding colors. The ribbon is super lightweight and fluffy just like chiffon should be. I love the frayed edges for a more rustic, natural, farmhouse sort of vibe, but if you don’t like frayed edges and want something neater, this isn’t the choice for you. Like all chiffon, it’s a bit challenging to work with, but a sharp pair of scissors is your friend.",
      "frayed edges|||B0C7V2QHNM ★★★★☆ <b>Adds luxury to gift wrap</b> Soft, drapey fabric ribbon with frayed edges- what's not to love? I unrolled one spool just to check it for consistency and it was perfect the full length. I use this type of ribbon for wrapping gifts. Bows are softer than with wired ribbon or pre-made bows, but they pack up in the car better for the holiday parties and don't arrive squished. The silver grey color compliments both kraft and shiny papers and is easy to work with. Tie around a wrapped box, tuck in a sprig of rosemary or pine, and it looks very classy in less time than it takes to peel the paper backing off a stick on bow.",

I'm copying an Oscar de La Renta design and weaving the frayed silk ribbon through the openings in the crochet to create a new texture. I'll be using this wide frayed ribbon to make a knotted fringe on the hem of the shirt. It will compliment the other ribbons I've used and create a consistent finished hem. Should look so elegant.

      "Frayed edges|||B0C33MW9CY ★★★★★ <b>Make the ordinary extraordinary</b> Four rolls of rich deep forest green chiffon ribbon. Frayed edges are casually elegant; the silky, soft texture drapes beautifully. Uniform color. There are so many uses: gift wrapping, covering bouquet stems, embellishing hand-made cards, tying decorative book stacks, crafts, and so much more. They are beautiful and will make the ordinary extraordinary. The ribbons were protectively packaged in a reusable cardboard box and arrived undamaged. I love these gorgeous ribbons and look forward to using them.",
      "Frayed edges|||B0C33MW9CY ★★★★★ <b>Delicate, gauzy ribbons</b> As someone who gifts my handknits regularly, I tend to be very aware that whatever packaging I put things in just becomes clutter. I've taken to just wrapping blankets, sweaters, etc. in a ribbon for the presentation. This ribbon is quite beautiful. I choose a sage green, so that it's neutral on any gift. It's very delicate and the frayed edges look so pretty on packages. The ribbon is about 1.5 inches wide and 5 yards long per spool. (You get 4 spools in the package.) This means I can wrap quite a few packages in this ribbon. at 1.5 inches, I tend to use this for smaller packages, with thinner yarn. it's more of a summer wrap. Because the chiffon is thin, this is very gauzy, so be aware that it's not a robust, satiny ribbon. It's very very delicate. I like it a lot.",
      "Frayed edges|||B09QS757YZ ★★★★★ <b>*Nice set of cotton ribbon!*</b> I got this ribbon in the \"Incanus & Green\" set & I really appreciate & chose this brand & color since they're made of COTTON!!! :D (Many ribbons on Amazon are made of polyester & I was first going to choose the \"Green\" set made by this company, but that is the only set in their ad that is made of polyester, so I chose the \"Incanus & Green\" cotton set instead! :) It's nice quality, thin but durable ribbon & I like the \"rustic\" frayed edges of them! The colors I received are soft, neutral tones & the ribbon can be used for a variety of projects. I wish the darker \"Green\" set in their ad was also made of cotton (since that's the set that would've been my first choice for the decorative project I'm using the ribbon for) but I always choose cotton over polyester whenever I can, so that's why I chose the cotton \"Incanus & Green\" set instead of the polyester \"Green\" set. I really appreciate the company's effort in making most of their ribbons out of cotton instead of polyester, so that they're biodegradable whenever they someday wind up in the trash/dump...(as happens with everything in life eventually...nothing lasts forever lol.) So I heartily applaud & appreciate this company's more natural & eco-conscious approach by making their ribbon mostly out of cotton versus other companies who use polyester. I also like the simplistic, natural brown paper packaging the ribbon comes in. Decorating shouldn't have to be harmful to the environment & this company helps to achieve that! *Thank you!!* :D",
      "frayed edges|||B0BD8BZKKV ★★★★★ <b>Gorgeous velvet ribbon</b> I ordered this to wrap Christmas presents with. I have a red tartan plaid wrapping paper and this black velvet is so elegant against the plaid. The fray edges add a touch of whimsy and add to that limp velvet look that is so popular right now. This ribbon is a 10/10 for me.",

That said, I got the rose gold ribbon and was a little surprised that the color more vibrant in person that it looked in the pictures in the item listing (the second photo in the listing that shows the height of the spool is the closest to what the ribbon looks like in real life, it has more of a warm peach undertone than a blush undertone).

It holds well and I have plenty extra so I used a bit for a headband that stayed snug all day long. Win-Win-Win. Now, where else can I use this? Hmmmm....."

I noticed that it has a tendency to fray where it's cut, leaving behind velvet \"snow\" which makes a mess.

Edges of the ribbon are frayed. Disappointed. Would not recommend or purchase again. Editing after going through each roll. These ribbons are worse than I originally thought. Huge sections are not woven properly and completely unusable. Roughly 1/2-1 yard of each color can be used and isn't damaged. Obviously no quality control. When I try to cut the ribbon, it comes completely apart.",

Might take a few tries to get it just right.",
      "Almost invisible edge detail|||B08P9NPY3P ★★☆☆☆ <b>EXTREMELY THIN AND NOT DOUBLE FACED</b> As the old adage goes, “You get what you pay for”, KINDA? VALUE: If this ribbon was going to the trash with wrapping paper, $4.99 for 100 yards is a good value. I’m giving the supplier credit that there actually are 100 yards on the roll. Unfortunately I bought this ribbon to serve as page markers for a Bible rebind. So, this ribbon is just too cheap looking and flimsy for that use. Value for me is zero. QUALITY: mediocre to poor, extremely thin material with almost invisible edge detail. PACKAGING: Unlike ribbon sold at brick and mortar stores, this roll came rolled around a core and in a cellophane envelope, but with no chip board sides to prevent the entire roll from falling off the sides of the core and totally tangling. PRODUCT LISTENING: Sold as Dark Red Double Faced Color is subjective but this roll of Dk Red appears to this purchaser to be closer to Light Red Wine in color. With a decidedly different texture on the reverse side, it is highly doubtful that this can be considered “Double Faced”. SUMMARY: If you are looking for ribbon for decoration, say for hair ribbons or seasonal decor, or for more permanent items like sewing into a dress or to make book markers, look elsewhere. If you only want to tie up a quick gift, or need wine colored string, go for it.",

The metallic gold plays off of the burlap very well and I like the wired edges. That said, this does not make a good big fluffy bow with lots of loops. This is a better choice for the clipped bows that use several different ribbons that are cris-crossed and then pulled up. Or a simple one loop bow tied with some string or raffia in the middle. This is a great ribbon for gift wrapping and tying a gift bag. I used some of this at Christmas for some gift bags but I was happy that most of the designs were neutral so I can use them for a relative's 50's anniversary coming up soon.

The glitter does tend to shed, as glitter does, so be aware of that. The rolls are short and probably not enough in one roll to wrap a gift properly.

I have it paired with a leopard print paper and then also with a deep green malachite-marbled paper and it looks great with both. It adds a touch of unexpected fun to the packages because it is so pink. The middle is sheer so that is an understated part but along the edges the ribbon is thicker and wired and that's where the neon-like brightness comes in and just -\"Pow!\"- makes a statement. I shouldn't say neon because it's not trendy neon - its just the perfect shade of \"extra\" you want in a pink ribbon. I ordered several rolls of the 50 yards and doubt it will ever run out.

It's slightly sheer without being too sheer, so it will stand out on the tree. It sparkles and shimmers in the original packaging.

And it is so versatile I can hardly wait to make bows to include on gifts, for children's hair, and even decorations. The Bow-dabra comes with an instruction book which is great but the creators went the extra mile and included a DVD to demonstrate just what you can do with it. VERY nice. The DVD is divided into sections so you can go right to the type of bow you want to make. Or, you can watch the entire thing all the way through which I did. You can make tiny bows for hair, decorative bows for packages, bows that include foil decorations, berries, flowers, or anything you can think of to include in the bow. They even demonstrate how to use up old scraps of ribbon to make a gorgeous bow. And these bows can get massive! You just have to see it after purchasing the Bow-dabra. I am planning a Bow-dabra party for my friends, to show them what all it will do. Summer is a great time to start thinking about Christmas decorations and gift wrapping so it would be fun to let each guest make a bow of their choosing. The guests can either bring their own ribbon and decorations or I could provide those. Either way, it's more fun if you do it yourself and have something to show. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that each bow you make uses a gold wire that is conveniently included in the Bow-dabra box. There is enough for about 10 bows. Do you can get the hang of it before buying more wire. The wire is only used to hold the bow together, so you could probably find some other colors. But I love the gold. It adds elegance to every bow. This is the cutest and most useful craft item I have seen in a long time. You just have to get one and try it for yourself. I LOVE this!"

I unrolled one spool just to check it for consistency and it was perfect the full length. I use this type of ribbon for wrapping gifts. Bows are softer than with wired ribbon or pre-made bows, but they pack up in the car better for the holiday parties and don't arrive squished. The silver grey color compliments both kraft and shiny papers and is easy to work with.

NEUTRALS: - The ribbons are a bit thinner than I expected; most of my velvet ribbons are completely opaque, but these you are able to see your finger through if you’re holding it. Since I’m just using this for wrapping and small designs, it’s not a major issue for me personally. CONS: - The ribbon is both lighter and more orange toned than it appeared in the listing images (I checked it under different light sources). I would call it a brown orange over a khaki for sure. - The ends fray if you don’t use incredibly sharp shears. DIRECTLY GIFTABLE?: Sure, it’s just a plain white ribbon wheel, wrapped in plastic. Nothing notable really. CONCLUSION: - It’s a nice ribbon, but the color and fray potential is why it still landed at four stars for me.

I let my husband do it every now and again when it comes to gifts that he gives to his friends, me, or if it's something sentimental for his parents (and yes, someone always makes the joke \"I know who wrapped this one!\"). I did find out that he had pull riboon roll for bows, which his mother had given him (you can always hide bad wrapping with a nice bow). It beat making my own bows so I got really used to using his stash, and basically used it up. I went back to making my own bows, using my fingers and toes, and sometimes knees to hold all the loops down and I cursed the day that he didn't have more magical bow rolls stashed somewhere else in his closet. Then this came into my feed. A Bow Maker. One where I didn't have to ask the kids to put their fingers in the middle and actually sit still until it was finished. Or one where I didn't have to squish my husband's finger while trying to tie a knot in the middle of the loops (just for his finger to get caught, we get into a situation and I have to start all over). One thing I wish though, is that it came apart so that I can easily store it. The large middle pieces could have been made to slide out so it's more compact.

The ribbon is just the right width for these types of shots: not too thin or too wide. It creates amazing interest when trailing through a photo of an invitation suite or curled around the wedding rings. The ribbon actually appears 2-sided. One side is clearly shiny, the other is more matte. The fraying is natural, but tidy. My favorite part of this set, though, is the inclusion of the spools!! I’ve been hoping to add spools to my detail kit… and here they are! They are also the perfect size. Enough to add pop and interest to a picture, but not so large or bulky to take away from the actual bridal details themselves. My only wish would be to have the option to mix and match colors. Since this ribbon is not for a specific craft or one-use project in my case, I would prefer a choice of colors rather than 3 spools of the same color. But, I’d still buy another Vitalizart set.

I might have expected more length for each ribbon and frankly, I didn't search for lengths in the product description and went with the picture envisioning each was a separate roll. With that said, once I got over the packaging, each one was fun to use. The variety is what I liked the most. If you need lengthy ribbons, you might need a supplement or other ribbons to add to your wrapping assortment. I had a wide lengthy roll that I used as my primary one, and I used these to add accents.",

Instead it was all wadded up in a cheap plastic bag (see photo). I thought, “Did I really order this?” When I went back to check, sure enough, the description said, “10 Yards Velvet Ribbon Spool...” It’s pretty, and is the color I wanted, a light turquoise. The quality seems just OK, nothing special. I got it for use on hand-sewed upcycled clothing projects, so time will tell, as will the number of washings. Maybe if the presentation was a little closer to the description, meaning, had it actually arrived on a spool, the initial perceived quality might be a tad higher. The lack of spool was so annoying that I was almost ready to return it. Then I discovered that the piece was actually 10 yards and 18 inches. So maybe they were aware of the spool thing and duked me some extra, which I appreciate. And the price was certainly in the right ballpark, so I’m keeping it.",

Luckily I had an empty cardboard spool that on which I wound 3/4 of the ribbon. It wouldn’t all fit so I just wound the remaining up and secured it with another piece of string. I hope to god that all the ribbon producers don’t start doing this. If is costs more to do it right then charge a little more. I won’t get anything from these chizzlin’ rats.

      "Nice display package with little indentations to keep each roll|||B09XM6ZN1Q ★★★★☆ <b>We had a lot of fun threading pony beads onto the green 💚 today</b> These really nice multicolored skinny ribbons can be used for all kinds of arts and crafts. Cards scrapbooking adorning clothing, hats you name it this sky's the limit. I like how the 20 colors of 100 yards of ribbon come in a nice display package with little indentations to keep each roll. That's really neat. I did notice that a couple of my 🌈 rainbow colors had less on the roll than the other rolls had, so I don't know what's up with that but every inch counts. Today my mom and I decided to string some really nice pony beads I'm also testing onto a length of the lime green ribbon. To make sure that the beads would stay on for my mom we knotted one near the bottom of one end of the length that I kind of measured not with tape just kind of put it around my neck and figured out how big I'd want it for it to go over her neck easy. Since we both shake with essential tremor, I wanted to make it easier for her to string the thin ribbon into the big pony bead openings. So I wrapped some Scotch tape around the other end. I wish I could show you that first video I made for you guys. I had it too thick and somehow I also had it the tape on slow motion? So it's really weird but it would take too long to upload I'm sure. Also my mom was joking with me and pulling the tip of the ribbon away so I couldn't stick the little bead on. It was funny you had to be there I guess haha just imagine it. 😜 Anyway, I made the tape narrower and it finally worked perfectly for my mom to string the beads on. It gives her practice with patterning and remembering colors and just hand eye coordination and all those mental gymnastics we need to do to keep our aging brains sharp. Plus she loves jewelry so making her own is even better. It's great how this pack of ribbon gives you so many colors at once without you having to buy 10,000 yards of each. Made in China.",
      "Neatly packaged on styrofoam roll|||B0922M29Z4 ★★★☆☆ <b>The count came up short</b> This is the product you buy for the price and the quantity, not the quality. We all know it. So I was happy to see a pretty nice set of ribbons when I opened my Amazon box. The colors are vibrant, they were packaged very neatly, and the ribbon was rolled on a round piece of styrofoam. I compared the ribbon to some from the craft store and they are pretty close. This ribbon was a little thinner and the ribs were longer but they felt exactly the same. I’d pick this ribbon as it has the best price. Where the issues showed up were when I went to rewrap each of these onto the flat cardboard bobbins I prefer. I’ve included photos showing the things I found. The silver/grey had a defective area of about 5” right in the middle of the row. The peach/light coral one is two toned the entire length, with one edge much lighter than the other. Some of them, like the yellow are really kinked. I’m not sure how as they were rolled, but there are definitely distinct kinks there. I really hope they relax on their own as I don’t feel like fussing with them. Not a bad thing but you should know that the orange, lime green, and yellow are really neon color. Super bright. The biggest issue is the cut. Of the 24 rolls only 4 are the correct length. 12 rolls, half of the total number, are shorter than 4 yards each. The difference was 1.5 to 7 inches short each. A total of 39.25 inches were missing, more than a yard. The remaining 8 rolls were longer than 4 yards, with the same differences. Maybe they think it balances out? To me it didn’t matter as I have no set lengths I need. But to those of you looking for exactly 4 yards you should probably keep shopping. The ribbon wasn’t too stiff. It’s just like all the other grosgrain ribbon I have. I really do like colors, it’s a great selection. Even with the issues I’d buy this product again. It really is the best price.",

Made of silky, shiny, satin fabric with frayed edges for style. It will work great as that soft touch on Wedding and Christmas presents! It comes in a box with three rolls. Each roll is 1.5” wide and comes in 5 yards rolls. (total 15 yards). Can be used in crafting, bow making, creating wreaths and floral designs, etc. Very versatile ribbon!",

      "Comes in multiple rolls|||B0BNNGPF2T ★★★★★ <b>Lovely and Sheer</b> This came in three rolls, packed in a small box just large enough to accommodate them. The fabric is quite sheer, as promised, and in color tends more towards the cream shade, rather than pure white. There are any number of uses for this fringed ribbon - decorating packages, or tabletops, or as trim on costumes.",
      "Multiple spools in package|||B08G8262PX ★★★★★ <b>Christmas Decor</b> The product came as described. I loved the variety in the ribbon supplied. Each role is full and long and easy to use. Definitely worth the purchase.",
      "Multiple spools|||B09XM6ZN1Q ★★★★★ <b>Beautiful ribbon</b> So happy to have all of these colors of ribbon. I use ribbon like this in my sewing and crafting. I am constantly going to get ribbon for my projects. This amount of ribbon would cost me about $60 retail. This is an amazing deal!",
      "Multiple rolls in set|||B0C8HLJZ78 ★★★★★ <b>Very cute set of Christmas ribbon!</b> These are neatly packaged in a box and are a really cute set of ribbons for Christmas! It seems like nice quality ribbon and almost all of the printing images/text on them are done well and are clear. There are two rolls - one with snowmen and one with gnomes that are just a little bit blurry. Not quite as clear as they should be, but not terrible. I will certainly still use them. The ribbon isn't colored on both sides - the back is white, if that matters to you. For some of my projects that would be fine, but others it would be nice if the back was the same overall color as the front. And this really isn't a big deal, but I'd like it better if the box opened where you could see all the different ribbon and you could use it to store them in. This flat skinny box is great for shipping, but you have to dump them all out to see them. Again, not a big deal. Just thought I'd mention it. Overall, a really great assortment of ribbon!",
      "Multiple spools|||B0C8HLJZ78 ★★★★★ <b>So incredibly CUTE!</b> You cannot go wrong with this ribbon. Pretty much any color you need can be found right here in this package. Keep in mind that this ribbon is thin. It can be used with wider ribbons for gift wrapping or for making bows for your crafts. I'm looking forward to using each and every spool of ribbon included in this package.",
      "multiple colors on individual spools|||B0C52SKZD6 ★★★★★ <b>Not too thin</b> These ribbons are the perfect size for gifts and gift baskets. They come in multiple colors on their individual spools. Easy to cut to the size you need and easy to tie, making craft time for little ones simple. They are not a cheap or flimsy material, pretty good quality and the colors are bold, like described in the pics.",
      "many rolls in the set|||B09XM6ZN1Q ★★★★★ <b>Nice colorful ribbon set</b> This set has many vibrant colors and is a good diameter and width for my needs. It has many tolls of ribbon on the set and that is a great value for the quality, color options, double faved satin finish and glitter options for the price.",
      "Multiple spools|||B09XM6ZN1Q ★★★★★ <b>Great assortment of 3/8th inch satin ribbon</b> This assortment of satin ribbon is great to have around, especially as the holidays draw near. Although you could use this for wrapping presents, I will save it for craft projects. There are larger spools of some colors than others. I plan to mount a dowel to thread these onto to make them more accessible. Otherwise, you have to leave them tied up in the bag or you’ll just have 20 spools thrown into a drawer. Recommended.",
      "Multiple rolls in set|||B0CB5M64Q7 ★★★★★ <b>Excellent Quality</b> This ribbon assortment came exactly as shown. The colors, print, and lettering are all correct. It is wired which is perfect for what I need. I like to do big, fluffy bows for Christmas decorations.",
      "Multiple rolls in set|||B0CB5M64Q7 ★★★★★ <b>Amazing value!</b> I saw similar ribbon priced 40% off at my favorite craft store. It was still higher than this. You get plenty on each roll to make multiple crafts! The wire is perfect for bows. The colors are bright and fun and will coordinate with your other items. The ribbon is nice and thick. Highly recommend.",
      "Multiple rolls in set|||B0CB5M64Q7 ★★★★☆ <b>Perfect Grinch themed ribbons!</b> As a Grinch fan, I could not pass these up! The colors and printing are definitely Grinchy and they nail the exact hues and images from the movies. The wire is flexible and easy to manipulate into bows or otherwise. The material isn't the greatest and has some sheerness to it, but when they're all tied up, they look fantastic and full. Two of the rolls have glitter accents, the others do not. The glitter does tend to shed, as glitter does, so be aware of that. The rolls are short and probably not enough in one roll to wrap a gift properly. They are, however, perfect for wreath and tree bows or other DIY holiday crafts. They are super festive, very fun to look at and I can't wait to put them on my wreaths this Decemeber!",

      "3 spools|||B0B9J9HG5Z ★★★★★ <b>This ribbon is so cute!</b> I love this ribbon. I feel like there is so much in the 3 spools and it worked perfect for the bows on my tree. I didn’t measure how much 3/8” is and it’s fairly thin but I think it turned out so cute. This ribbon is very soft and the bows are droopy but I actually love it. I think because of the thinness of the ribbon it makes sense but I wouldn’t love it as much with a thicker ribbon. The color is true to the photos and i’m so impressed with the quality & price.",
      "multiple rolls|||B0CB5M64Q7 ★★★★★ <b>Nice ribbon for the holidays</b> We use ribbon mainly for making wreaths and other types of holiday decorations. I can't wait to make a grinch wreath with these. The ribbon quality is good and the print on the ribbon is really good. The ribbon has wire in it to make it easy to shape. I'd expect to pay 7 bucks a roll at least for this quality at Michael's or other craft stores. 4 of the rolls are grinch themed and 2 could be used for any holiday theme really.",
      "Multiple spools|||B0C8HLJZ78 ★★★★★ <b>Easy For Tying A Gift Bow</b> A great selection of narrow Christmas ribbons in bold red and green colors. Each of the 20 rolls has a unique Christmas design that includes snowflakes, mittens, Christmas trees, Gingerbread Men, etc. Because this ribbon is quite narrow it can easily be used to wrap small gifts like jewelry boxes.",
      "Two rolls included|||B0C53N99FX ★★★★★ <b>Vibrant mesh ribbon</b> I got this mesh ribbon in red, and it is vibrant and festive. The threads throughout the mesh are moldable and provide a bright contrast, and should look lovely in the holiday wreaths I plan to create. And with two rolls included, there should be plenty to use for all my projects."

I purchased 2 qty of this ribbon to make graduation leis. So imagine my extreme disappointment, with half a lei finished, to discover that there's a break in the ribbon - held together by tape - to get to the advertised yardage. I inspected the other roll...same story. Do not buy this brand for ribbon leis unless your ready to scrap the entire thing 20 minutes in and start over.",

      "multiple colors in large rolls|||B09MBZC8Q8 ★★★☆☆ <b>Nice, with a couple of issues.</b> This ribbon looks nice enough if you just need something to use to hang thinga with, but I was disappointed for several reasons. The first is my fault: I really didn't do the math well when I ordered this, and I just didn't realize how short a length I would get off each color. Some of these colors are gorgeous, but others I know I'm unlikely to use again. That tends to mean the colors I don't like will pile up, if I try to re-purchase more of the ones I do like - and that will happen quickly, with only 1 yard of each color. I really, really hate the way these were packed. The product picture shows each color rolled separately, but that's not what you get. Instead, you get about a half-dozen large rolls, which contain multiple colors. Without unrolling each one, it's impossible to see what's there. Because of this before I could even use the ribbon, I spent an hour and a half unrolling the big rolls and making small, individual rolls with each color. After that, I can see and access them all easily. But honestly, I really had much better things to do with my time than repack 30 yards of ribbon. The quality isn't bad. I had hoped for thicker ribbon, as I planned to use these to make necklaces and I want them to last. A thicker pile to the ribbon would prevent it from wrinkling too easily, and would keep it from looking prematurely worn. Anything I make from these, I will have to charge a bit less for and warn customers that the necklace cord will eventually wear out. What I do like: many of these colors are stunning. It is nice to have a sampler to allow me to figure out what I need most. I really hope that they hold up better than I am expecting. Time will tell. If all you need is ribbons for trim, or to hang ornaments from, these are a good choice. I think, however, they for my purposes, I am going to have to keep looking for higher quality."

All 3 rolls had streaks of brown and black specks throughout the whole roll of ribbon. Plus it was wrinkled. Even after ironing, you could still see creases where the wrinkles were. It was a nightmare! Since I didn't have backup ribbon, I had to keep cutting and starting over wasting most of the ribbon or wasting time trying to hide the black specks the best I could. I don't usually write bad reviews, but this ribbon is terrible!"

I could clearly see the lighter ribbon underneath but must’ve been from heating the material because it’s been drying awhile now and appears back to all black. The spool read “washing fastness test” so perhaps it is color fast. I’ll have to wash some by hand to test before I use though. Update: I had goofed before when I wrote the above review. I had looked at the wrong place on the spool and thought the iron had only temporarily made a color change with the heat but in fact I found the place where I hit it with an iron and the dye is indeed gone. I’ve been shrinking ribbons for years by wetting and pressing and it’s never happened before.

      "Kinked ribbon (especially yellow)|||B0922M29Z4 ★★★☆☆ <b>The count came up short</b> This is the product you buy for the price and the quantity, not the quality. We all know it. So I was happy to see a pretty nice set of ribbons when I opened my Amazon box. The colors are vibrant, they were packaged very neatly, and the ribbon was rolled on a round piece of styrofoam. I compared the ribbon to some from the craft store and they are pretty close. This ribbon was a little thinner and the ribs were longer but they felt exactly the same. I’d pick this ribbon as it has the best price. Where the issues showed up were when I went to rewrap each of these onto the flat cardboard bobbins I prefer. I’ve included photos showing the things I found. The silver/grey had a defective area of about 5” right in the middle of the row. The peach/light coral one is two toned the entire length, with one edge much lighter than the other. Some of them, like the yellow are really kinked. I’m not sure how as they were rolled, but there are definitely distinct kinks there. I really hope they relax on their own as I don’t feel like fussing with them. Not a bad thing but you should know that the orange, lime green, and yellow are really neon color. Super bright. The biggest issue is the cut. Of the 24 rolls only 4 are the correct length. 12 rolls, half of the total number, are shorter than 4 yards each. The difference was 1.5 to 7 inches short each. A total of 39.25 inches were missing, more than a yard. The remaining 8 rolls were longer than 4 yards, with the same differences. Maybe they think it balances out? To me it didn’t matter as I have no set lengths I need. But to those of you looking for exactly 4 yards you should probably keep shopping. The ribbon wasn’t too stiff. It’s just like all the other grosgrain ribbon I have. I really do like colors, it’s a great selection. Even with the issues I’d buy this product again. It really is the best price.",

In some lights it looks navy and other times its kind of a deep royal blue. The nap is low, but it’s dense and looks plush. It’s soft and flexible for tying bows and it’s easy to sew with. At less than a dollar a yard, it’s a great value."

The thickness is a total disappointment though. It sticks to itself and it shreds with every cut and was extremely hard to work with because it frayed with each cut. I have gotten better quality mesh from the dollar tree to be honest. I personally, will not buy this mesh again."

I have it paired with a leopard print paper and then also with a deep green malachite-marbled paper and it looks great with both. It adds a touch of unexpected fun to the packages because it is so pink. The middle is sheer so that is an understated part but along the edges the ribbon is thicker and wired and that's where the neon-like brightness comes in and just -\"Pow!\"- makes a statement. I shouldn't say neon because it's not trendy neon - its just the perfect shade of \"extra\" you want in a pink ribbon. I ordered several rolls of the 50 yards and doubt it will ever run out.

It was also a huge quantity for the money and very nice quality. It came spooled around a piece of foam which worked well. It does not have any wire to it and had a soft flowy feel instead. It is not glittery, but shiny and see-through. I found that it cut well with sharp fabric scissors that had not dulled on other things. If you don't have sharp scissors it may be difficult to cut cleanly without the edges fraying (this is typical for fragile fabrics). Overall I highly recommend.",

      "slightly see-through|||B08M5QMQLP ★★★☆☆ <b>Cheaper ribbon, but great quantity for the price.</b> I bought this product to use for multiple projects, and so far it has served its purpose well. One thing that I noticed immediately about the product was the packaging. It comes on a styrofoam spool with no ridges to hold it in place. I find it near impossible to store, and even more impossible to wrap the excess up when I am done using it. If the ribbon came on a cardboard spool with edges to keep it in place, I might have given this product another star. This might not be something that bothers anyone else, but if you are looking to store it and use it on multiple different projects, I suggest finding a different spool to store the ribbon on. Other than that, the ribbon was of decent quality. As I said, you get great yardage for the price, but the ribbon does feel a bit cheaper. There is one side that is clearly a more shiny satin than the other. Additionally, the ribbon is a bit see-through. Further, when cut with scissors, the ribbon almost immediately frays, as seen in the attached photos. This is a problem with any ribbon but was especially noticeable with this one. I have yet to attempt to seal it with a lighter, but I am not sure how well that would work as the ribbon immediately disintegrates into a million strings after you cut it. Overall, if you are looking to do a project that requires a large amount of ribbon and you aren't too worried about the quality, then I suggest this product. But, if you are looking for ribbon to use throughout multiple projects, or want a nicer quality ribbon, then I suggest you look elsewhere.",

The glitter does tend to shed, as glitter does, so be aware of that. The rolls are short and probably not enough in one roll to wrap a gift properly.

Really liked the pure gold ones but again the glitter is so bad. Had to wrap the presents in the garage and shake them a few times to try to get most of the glitter off. The 2 that had designs look and feel cheap. They have a thin plastic feel to them and they are see through. So out of 4 rolls I will only be using the 2 pure gold ones. The other 2 will go to the trash unfortunately. I will not be ordering again.

The texture is matte, not shiny, which I prefer. Each spool has 5 yards of ribbon for a total of 15 yards. The price seems a bit high for this type of ribbon and I’m sure it’s due to the wooden spools. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. Sometimes having reusable wooden spools is exactly why I’ve made a specific purchase. This ribbon can be used in a variety of ways. I’ll be using when wrapping Christmas gifts, for hanging ornaments on my Christmas tree, and for embellishing fall/winter clothes I’ll be sewing for my granddaughters. I’ll add pictures when I can. I recommend this item only if you plan to reuse the wooden spools once the ribbon has been used."

It’s an odd, very thin material with the shiny surface on one side only. The back side is matte, but it also has significantly less color. It crushes easily and keeps those creases, so bow making is very tricky. One it has a crease, it’s there for good. It is a pretty color, though, so if you can use it without creasing it at all? It should work for crafts."

If you've never worked with velvet ribbon before, just know that part going in. I am not using this ribbon for sewing, but having handled it and examined it, I do think that it would be appropriate for a sewing project. The material is on the heavier side, it doesn't have a wired edge, and it doesn't seem to fray too badly.

      "burlap material|||B09BWXM4FT ★★★★★ <b>Beautiful Ribbon</b> The apple green ribbon is a beautiful, vibrant color. The burlap material is quite nice and easy to work with. It is thick and made a lovely, full bow. I have never worked with burlap before. So, I did not realize that when I cut it, there would be a little bit of unraveling. It was not a problem as this was at the end of the ribbon. So, I was able to tuck this out of sight under the bow. Great product and delivery was on-time.",

My spool was not 50 continuous yards, but spliced together at least once. I haven't finished the spool yet so I am hoping there are no more splices as I need long sections of ribbon. I have less than 10 yards left. Fingers crossed. Keep that in mind though, if you need a full 50 yard piece or have long sections to cut.

Bows are softer than with wired ribbon or pre-made bows, but they pack up in the car better for the holiday parties and don't arrive squished. The silver grey color compliments both kraft and shiny papers and is easy to work with.

They will be flowy. I loved the color which will lend itself to school colors. It is super soft and cut easily.

It’s a beautiful color, soft to the touch, with the perfect amount of shine. It’s lovely. I love it so much, I just purchased another roll in the lovely purple color to add some color to a Halloween costume. The only thing I will say that I dislike, is that it is a bit on the pricey side, but you pay for quality.

He had an earlier edition of that book that had other animals and how to make this bow in it.) The softness of the ribbon made it hard for me to work with but I am now 70 and realizing that I am losing my dexterity that I had when I first made the bow in my 20’s or earlier. The ribbon would keep slipping out of place, but that was because of what it was made of, so that may be something to consider, but don’t let that keep you from purchasing it. It is absolutely gorgeous and a great buy.",

I also photograph newborns and milestones and these ribbons would really well for tiebacks and headbands that we make custom for our client closets.

I am able to use this with my sewing machine, and while it was really difficult to fold and iron flat- it doesn't hold a crease very well and I couldn't get it to fold straight- it held up fabulously under my sewing machine. The satin is soft and pliable, not plastic feeling, and it didn't melt from the iron, even on the hottest setting. I'm using it as a hem for a rainbow petticoat, so I won't be washing it, but I think it would be okay to send through the washer and dryer, since it didn't melt from the iron. The colors are very vibrant and true to the picture.",

The only downside is that the color isn't as bright as I had hoped. It's not exactly like the product images. It's not necessarily gold, but it's also not a bright sunshine yellow as pictured. It's more of a muted sunshine yellow if that makes any sense at all. It's not pale, and it's not a dark gold, it's just a more subdued sunny yellow. The color really is pretty. I'll just need to use it for something else. Then again, it's always hard to match color on a coputer monitor.",

After double checking other reviews, it seems that several people received 2 spools of 25 yards to make up the 50 yards, which I would have been fine with. I didn't think anything of it being smaller than my other 50 yard spools because I thought it was due to the smaller core. Nowhere on the spool label or cellophane wrap did it give a yardage size. Amazon was going to allow me to return the pieces, but I canceled the return because I would rather eat the cost and make 12 masks instead of none. The ribbon itself is gorgeous.

They will be wonderful for Christmas crafting and wrapping small gifts. These are very pretty soft fluffy ribbons. The red is a nice rich deep red. Green is a softer version of a color and not overly dark. What a treat to have them on wooden spools. I will probably use those in my crafting too when the ribbon is gone. There are 5 yards of each color ribbon on the spools. For my crafting this will go fairly far, but if you are wrapping large gifts or doing large projects just know the amount you need. These are perfect for holidays and would make a lovely gift. The whole set feels very special.",

I prefer this brand by far the most. I've gotten it in different colors and sizes and it all been great. It's soft, sturdy, and the fabric doesn't snag weird or anything. It always looks pristine. My only complaint is not having a wider color selection. If they offered more I'd definitely buy it!",

I have less than 10 yards left. Fingers crossed. Keep that in mind though, if you need a full 50 yard piece or have long sections to cut.

It's not overly sparkly with just some shimmery threads running lengthwise down the ribbon. The ribbon is a very thin mesh which I like because it will look delicate and not heavy on the tree. The stiff mesh catches on everything which is very annoying but also very helpful - I can tuck it in between branches so that it holds its shape and remains tucked.",

And this really isn't a big deal, but I'd like it better if the box opened where you could see all the different ribbon and you could use it to store them in.

      "Ruler that slots on top|||B0C24XWHW4 ★★★★☆ <b>Simple Tool to Simplify Bow Making</b> This Bowdabra Hairbow Making hit is a great tool for holding your project in place for consistent and tightly crafted bows each time. It best assists when working with multiple materials and/or layers but is easiest to learn on single layered bows. This device would be most useful as a gift for individuals who experience pain, fatigue, or difficulty with fine motor movements. This set arrives with the main gadget, a ruler that slots on top and then a piece to evenly scrunch down your DIY bow. In addition, it also includes a CD-ROM, membership on the website and a roll of metallic tie. Personally, I feel as though the CD-ROM format is very dated; in order to access the tutorial, there is an application that must run. This did not launch on my computer and I could not gain access to it despite many attempts. I also accessed the website and the PDF walkthroughs to best understand how to complete a bow with the assistance of this device.

      "Roll of metallic tie|||B0C24XWHW4 ★★★★☆ <b>Simple Tool to Simplify Bow Making</b> This Bowdabra Hairbow Making hit is a great tool for holding your project in place for consistent and tightly crafted bows each time.

      "Includes Bowdabra tool|||B0C24XWHW4 ★★★★★ <b>Your ribbon collection just tripled… Easy to use and huge time saver.</b> Bowdabra is such a game changer for making all kinds of professional looking bows. I don’t need to pin it down while I’m making folds with my toes anymore! And can make a bow using two or three different kinds of ribbon with ease. I didn’t watch the included DVD yet, as I’ve seen these used on YouTube and it’s sort of easy to figure out -but I’d suggest watching it anyway. I could be doing it wrong:). First you put a chenille wire (or any type you prefer) into the groove. This contraption basically just pinches the ribbon while you make the folds. Then after you work your magic, just pull it out by your wire and twist. This is SO much faster than by hand, it is totally worth it. I designed a second holiday wreath just so I could use this more and will be making up reasons to give gifts to wrap all year. If you enjoy giftwrapping or crafting with bows, I very much recommend the Bow-Dabra.",

Think I'll even make some little hair bows for my 3 year granddaughter as well. So if you love doing crafts and making bows this little tool is awesome and will be a great addition to all you crafters out there. I highly recommend!",

And it is so versatile I can hardly wait to make bows to include on gifts, for children's hair, and even decorations. The Bow-dabra comes with an instruction book which is great but the creators went the extra mile and included a DVD to demonstrate just what you can do with it. VERY nice. The DVD is divided into sections so you can go right to the type of bow you want to make. Or, you can watch the entire thing all the way through which I did. You can make tiny bows for hair, decorative bows for packages, bows that include foil decorations, berries, flowers, or anything you can think of to include in the bow. They even demonstrate how to use up old scraps of ribbon to make a gorgeous bow. And these bows can get massive! You just have to see it after purchasing the Bow-dabra. I am planning a Bow-dabra party for my friends, to show them what all it will do. Summer is a great time to start thinking about Christmas decorations and gift wrapping so it would be fun to let each guest make a bow of their choosing. The guests can either bring their own ribbon and decorations or I could provide those. Either way, it's more fun if you do it yourself and have something to show. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that each bow you make uses a gold wire that is conveniently included in the Bow-dabra box. There is enough for about 10 bows. Do you can get the hang of it before buying more wire. The wire is only used to hold the bow together, so you could probably find some other colors. But I love the gold. It adds elegance to every bow. This is the cutest and most useful craft item I have seen in a long time. You just have to get one and try it for yourself. I LOVE this!",

      "Includes DVD|||B0C24XWHW4 ★★★★☆ <b>How about some detailed instructions instead of a DVD?</b> There are basic instructions included with this, but most of the info you'll want to know is on the DVD. Who even has a DVD player in their computers anymore? I don't, and I'm not going to dust off the one hooked to the TV and hunt down the remote; I haven't used that thing since I got Netflix a million years ago. Anyway, the bowmaker itself is easy to use, and the booklet of info offers some rudimentary directions. YouTube will give you more details. My recommendation is to purchase just the bowmaker itself and skip the kit. Use the money you'll save to buy ribbon.",
      "DVD instructions|||B0C24XWHW4 ★★★★☆ <b>Good extra set of hands, but dvd instructions and $14 more for a ruler is a bit...</b> I get it, this basically gives you an extra set of fingers for bow making. It's a simple concept executed simply. I'm a dollar store stick-on bow sort of person, but I've enjoyed making some small accents for gifts. It's pretty straightforward with minimal learning curve. That said, the price hike from the mini bow maker to the hair bow maker is a bit silly considering you only get a ruler plate that doesn't even properly snap to the main unit. I may be missing something but I went through the printed instructions and there's nothing about securing the plate. It shifts a bit as a result. This brings me to the second main con: it's 2023, why are your instructions on a dvd???? Most computers these days don't have cd drives!! So I hope it wasn't too important, I can't use it.",

I wanted to exchange it out, but the process was not easy, so I had to do a return, which I really did not want to do. I can't rate the product on effectiveness because the item was defective.

That having been said, the colors of this lot were as follows: the navy was deep - almost black. The emerald green was spot on old fashioned green (think beleek) and the forest green is deep and rich. The blue is a robins egg, not a teal as in many of the pics. The gray is a pigeon color, and the yellow is a rich warm marigold. The maroon is a rich garnet, and the peach is a true baby peach. As for the pinks: the pale is a true baby girl pink, the hot pink is somewhere between Barbie pink and strawberry, and the red is a cool true red. The purple however is not a royal rich purple. It is more like a vibrant joyful lilac - very eastery. Hope this helps anyone wondering about colors !",

But vibrant colors</b> The colors are vibrant, and the ribbon is a nice thick quality, but unlike other buyers who were pictured here , my ribbon DIDNT COME ROLLED. Instead it came crimped with those horrible little wired bread ties which leaves a forever mark in velvet; so not all 36” is usable. That having been said, the colors of this lot were as follows: the navy was deep - almost black. The emerald green was spot on old fashioned green (think beleek) and the forest green is deep and rich. The blue is a robins egg, not a teal as in many of the pics. The gray is a pigeon color, and the yellow is a rich warm marigold. The maroon is a rich garnet, and the peach is a true baby peach. As for the pinks: the pale is a true baby girl pink, the hot pink is somewhere between Barbie pink and strawberry, and the red is a cool true red. The purple however is not a royal rich purple.

      "Beautiful shade of pink|||B09P33DZXR ★★☆☆☆ <b>Pretty ribbons but beware of length</b> I bought 10 these ribbons. I was expecting these ribbons to be of a certain length (22 yards PER roll) when I received them. These ribbons were purchased to be cut in certain lengths to be tied around trees & utility poles. FOUR of the ten rolls were not a consecutive 22 yards. They were cut & another piece taped on. It was like they ran out of ribbon so they added scrap ribbon to make up the difference. This caused my measure to be inaccurate for what I needed. Otherwise, the ribbon itself was a beautiful shade of pink, they were soft, the satin seemed like good quality but did gray easily.",

It's bright yet classy and, because of the wired edge, is easy to work with to form a great bow. I have it paired with a leopard print paper and then also with a deep green malachite-marbled paper and it looks great with both. It adds a touch of unexpected fun to the packages because it is so pink. The middle is sheer so that is an understated part but along the edges the ribbon is thicker and wired and that's where the neon-like brightness comes in and just -\"Pow!\"- makes a statement. I shouldn't say neon because it's not trendy neon - its just the perfect shade of \"extra\" you want in a pink ribbon. I ordered several rolls of the 50 yards and doubt it will ever run out. If it does run out I'll be reordering for sure. I LOVE this ribbon!",

My mom is planning the shower for our church family and local friends, so I'm helping her make all of the decorations. One of my favorite things we made was a DIY satin ribbon garland/banner. This was such a fun & easy project! I cut the ribbon colors into 3'(ish) long strips, then used a lighter to melt/seal the ends. After that, I folded each ribbon piece in half and made a slipknot around a piece of paracord. I alternated the colors until the garland was about 5-6 feet long. I'm going to hang it either across the front of a table or on the wall. I love that I can then save this and re-use it for baby's first birthday party!

      "color described as deep mauve, rose taupe, or mid tone puce|||B0B9J9HG5Z ★★★★★ <b>Cute presentation, although not very rosy</b> This order was a bit of a surprise. I knew I was taking a chance on the color, but curiosity got the best of me. I was really wondering what \"rose gold\" ribbon would look like in person. Well, if you're into color names, imagine a deep mauve, rose taupe, or mid tone puce. I think most people would consider it basically brown. It's not a terrible color, but don't expect it to coordinate with your other warm pastel pink rose gold metallics. I did like that it came on wooden spools. Unlike genuine antique spools, these are a bit rough, so if your gift recipient appreciates little details, you could totally unwind the ribbon and sand the spool smooth before rewinding the ribbon and gifting the set. Overall, I would say as long as you're comfortable with this color choice, this little set is worth the current $10 price tag and would look cute as craft room decor, or would be an easy Secret Santa gift for someone who likes to make elevated crafts.",

      "Two-toned peach/light coral|||B0922M29Z4 ★★★☆☆ <b>The count came up short</b> This is the product you buy for the price and the quantity, not the quality. We all know it. So I was happy to see a pretty nice set of ribbons when I opened my Amazon box. The colors are vibrant, they were packaged very neatly, and the ribbon was rolled on a round piece of styrofoam. I compared the ribbon to some from the craft store and they are pretty close. This ribbon was a little thinner and the ribs were longer but they felt exactly the same. I’d pick this ribbon as it has the best price. Where the issues showed up were when I went to rewrap each of these onto the flat cardboard bobbins I prefer. I’ve included photos showing the things I found. The silver/grey had a defective area of about 5” right in the middle of the row. The peach/light coral one is two toned the entire length, with one edge much lighter than the other. Some of them, like the yellow are really kinked. I’m not sure how as they were rolled, but there are definitely distinct kinks there. I really hope they relax on their own as I don’t feel like fussing with them. Not a bad thing but you should know that the orange, lime green, and yellow are really neon color. Super bright. The biggest issue is the cut. Of the 24 rolls only 4 are the correct length. 12 rolls, half of the total number, are shorter than 4 yards each. The difference was 1.5 to 7 inches short each. A total of 39.25 inches were missing, more than a yard. The remaining 8 rolls were longer than 4 yards, with the same differences. Maybe they think it balances out? To me it didn’t matter as I have no set lengths I need. But to those of you looking for exactly 4 yards you should probably keep shopping. The ribbon wasn’t too stiff. It’s just like all the other grosgrain ribbon I have. I really do like colors, it’s a great selection. Even with the issues I’d buy this product again. It really is the best price."

This 1\" Burgundy ribbon is just wrapped around a flat, circular piece of foam. I am worried about the whole thing unraveling. I am still able to use the ribbon and the result is exactly what I wanted. The lack of spool doesn't affect the actual quality of the product at all, just the ease of use and storage.

It’s double sided but still has a little bit of that crunchy feel to it (but still a nicer quality than that really cheap stuff). Final complaint is that it has a weird, chemical smell to it.

And while my other satin ribbon is a soft and shiny fabric this ribbon has a paper feel to it and looks grainy up close. I'm very disappointed in this purchase. If you're okay with orange red and don't expect a nice ribbon, this would be okay. It shipped quickly which was a bonus for this last minute wrapper. I gave unrolled a few yards and it appears to be one piece so far. It's very wrinkled despite being shipped on a spool. I don't recommend this ribbon.",
      "Dark Red appears closer to Light Red Wine|||B08P9NPY3P ★★☆☆☆ <b>EXTREMELY THIN AND NOT DOUBLE FACED</b> As the old adage goes, “You get what you pay for”, KINDA? VALUE: If this ribbon was going to the trash with wrapping paper, $4.99 for 100 yards is a good value. I’m giving the supplier credit that there actually are 100 yards on the roll. Unfortunately I bought this ribbon to serve as page markers for a Bible rebind. So, this ribbon is just too cheap looking and flimsy for that use. Value for me is zero. QUALITY: mediocre to poor, extremely thin material with almost invisible edge detail. PACKAGING: Unlike ribbon sold at brick and mortar stores, this roll came rolled around a core and in a cellophane envelope, but with no chip board sides to prevent the entire roll from falling off the sides of the core and totally tangling. PRODUCT LISTENING: Sold as Dark Red Double Faced Color is subjective but this roll of Dk Red appears to this purchaser to be closer to Light Red Wine in color. With a decidedly different texture on the reverse side, it is highly doubtful that this can be considered “Double Faced”. SUMMARY: If you are looking for ribbon for decoration, say for hair ribbons or seasonal decor, or for more permanent items like sewing into a dress or to make book markers, look elsewhere. If you only want to tie up a quick gift, or need wine colored string, go for it.",

I thought, “Did I really order this?” When I went back to check, sure enough, the description said, “10 Yards Velvet Ribbon Spool...” It’s pretty, and is the color I wanted, a light turquoise. The quality seems just OK, nothing special. I got it for use on hand-sewed upcycled clothing projects, so time will tell, as will the number of washings. Maybe if the presentation was a little closer to the description, meaning, had it actually arrived on a spool, the initial perceived quality might be a tad higher. The lack of spool was so annoying that I was almost ready to return it. Then I discovered that the piece was actually 10 yards and 18 inches. So maybe they were aware of the spool thing and duked me some extra, which I appreciate. And the price was certainly in the right ballpark, so I’m keeping it.",

The texture is matte, not shiny, which I prefer. Each spool has 5 yards of ribbon for a total of 15 yards. The price seems a bit high for this type of ribbon and I’m sure it’s due to the wooden spools. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. Sometimes having reusable wooden spools is exactly why I’ve made a specific purchase. This ribbon can be used in a variety of ways. I’ll be using when wrapping Christmas gifts, for hanging ornaments on my Christmas tree, and for embellishing fall/winter clothes I’ll be sewing for my granddaughters. I’ll add pictures when I can.

Incredible Quality for Ornament Hanging: Stunning Appearance: The rich, deep green color of this ribbon added a layer of opulence to my ornaments.

High-Quality Velvet Texture: The texture of the velvet is where this ribbon truly shines. The high-quality velvet feels soft and lush, and what's more, it avoids the overly shiny look that some ribbons tend to have. The subdued sheen enhances the overall elegance of the product. Non-Slip and Secure: One of the key highlights is the non-slip nature of this ribbon. Whether creating bows or simply hanging ornaments, the ribbon holds everything securely in place. No more slipping or sliding, just perfectly arranged bows that stay put.

The ribbon doesn't fray too much and is the right size for what I needed (if perhaps a tad bit thin). My only note is that it isn't quite as shiny as I was expecting (I ordered the gold). The gold is a little bit on the green side and not as metallic as I was hoping for but it is still beautiful and will work for the shower.

But vibrant colors</b> The colors are vibrant, and the ribbon is a nice thick quality, but unlike other buyers who were pictured here , my ribbon DIDNT COME ROLLED. Instead it came crimped with those horrible little wired bread ties which leaves a forever mark in velvet; so not all 36” is usable. That having been said, the colors of this lot were as follows: the navy was deep - almost black. The emerald green was spot on old fashioned green (think beleek) and the forest green is deep and rich. The blue is a robins egg, not a teal as in many of the pics. The gray is a pigeon color, and the yellow is a rich warm marigold. The maroon is a rich garnet, and the peach is a true baby peach. As for the pinks: the pale is a true baby girl pink, the hot pink is somewhere between Barbie pink and strawberry, and the red is a cool true red. The purple however is not a royal rich purple. It is more like a vibrant joyful lilac - very eastery. Hope this helps anyone wondering about colors !",

Instead it came crimped with those horrible little wired bread ties which leaves a forever mark in velvet; so not all 36” is usable. That having been said, the colors of this lot were as follows: the navy was deep - almost black. The emerald green was spot on old fashioned green (think beleek) and the forest green is deep and rich. The blue is a robins egg, not a teal as in many of the pics. The gray is a pigeon color, and the yellow is a rich warm marigold. The maroon is a rich garnet, and the peach is a true baby peach. As for the pinks: the pale is a true baby girl pink, the hot pink is somewhere between Barbie pink and strawberry, and the red is a cool true red. The purple however is not a royal rich purple. It is more like a vibrant joyful lilac - very eastery. Hope this helps anyone wondering about colors !"

Each year I craft homemade sauces, rubs, or other food gifts that I usually package in jars topped with a bit of colorful cloth. But when I ran out of narrow, delicate ribbon last year I was at a loss. Most traditional ribbon is either too thick or too stiff – or both – so it simply doesn’t work well for that type of task. This Vitalizart ribbon is practically perfect for my wrapping needs. It’s soft, supple, ties easily, and it stays in place. I think the small wooden spools are a lovely touch. They're so much classier than a cardboard spool – plus with the white ribbon they remind me of a little stack of double-stuffed Oreos. Cute!

To get a nice curl roll the ribbon from the bottom up and once in position unroll it. Great ribbon",

It can easily hold its shape and stay upright (instead of flopping over) when tied into a bow. The ribbon cuts easily and nicely without fraying and leaving little threads behind. The length is plenty long to have ribbon for a small to medium DIY project.",

The gray is a pigeon color, and the yellow is a rich warm marigold. The maroon is a rich garnet, and the peach is a true baby peach. As for the pinks: the pale is a true baby girl pink, the hot pink is somewhere between Barbie pink and strawberry, and the red is a cool true red. The purple however is not a royal rich purple.

I bought two rolls for 10 yards total. When I took off the cellophane wrap I could see that the ribbon had a white (!) cloth backing and the nap of the velvet is a bubble gum pink and not the dusty rose depicted. The \"velvet\" is nothing like woven velvet of the quality you want to use for fabric sewing of any kind from dust covers, slip covers, to hair accessories and garments such as hats or dresses. Real velvet ribbon is going to be soft and floppy. This was clearly intended for gift wrapping purposes imho, as stiff as could be. I asked the seller about use for some slip covers so this was disappointing. Further, you really cannot 'tie' this ribbon, only use it flat: if using for gift wrap. Returning. The seller had me print a return label for postage paid shipping back via USPS for the mailman to pick up and that seems really convenient. I will update as to how the return/refund process goes with this seller. UPDATE: The seller did issue my refund. One extra star for that but this is not the quality ribbon that a real seamstress expects for sewing with fabrics for use in clothing or home decor items. Look at how stiff the bow is that another reviewer showed when used as gift wrap. It looked okay but I would not personally use it for gift wrap since you will only get a stiff bow.",

Of course, you can use them singly as well. These are good enough quality that they can be used for packages but also for more decor related crafts. Adorning a tree, dressing up a swag, a design element of porch pots, using them as part of a tablescape in your dining room for a dinner party, all of these would be great places to utilize these ribbons. If you use them indoors and are careful about how you pack them away I think you could even get multiple seasons worth of use from them. At less than $3 per roll they seem reasonably priced.",

They don't give you enough to be able to wrap your the presents under your tree with a single roll, so I'm glad multiple different designs are included for a more eclectic theme. The print isn't as clear as in the photos, but you can definitely tell what it is... just wish the characters and writing was a bit sharper!

Good quality ribbon Things I don't like so much: The thicker ribbon wasn't as wide as I thought it was going to be. I really didn't have a bag or anything to put them in after I removed them from the original wrapping. I shoved them all in a ziplock bag... Overall I like them.

      "Christmas themed prints|||B0C8HLJZ78 ★★★★☆ <b>Cute ribbon, but all individual rolls</b> This is cute, thin ribbon with several different Christmas themed prints. It will certainly work as intended for gift wrapping. I took of one star though for two reasons: First, these all come as little individual spools, not two large spools as it looks like in the product pictures. That makes storage and keeping track of them more difficult. Second, the spools on the individual rolls of ribbon do not go all the way to the end of the spooled ribbon. As a result, as soon as you undo the tape holding the roll together about half the roll will just fall off since there is no spool supporting it. Again, not a big deal though as you will have to use about that much ribbon to wrap around a gift anyway."

Adorning a tree, dressing up a swag, a design element of porch pots, using them as part of a tablescape in your dining room for a dinner party, all of these would be great places to utilize these ribbons. If you use them indoors and are careful about how you pack them away I think you could even get multiple seasons worth of use from them. At less than $3 per roll they seem reasonably priced.",

Instead, its made of glitter that wipes away when you barely touch it, you cant take it into the rain, cause it will wash away before you have a chance to get dissaoppointed. I was gonna put it on my purse, as a decoration, and make collars for my pet with it, but if i did that, they would be eating glitter.",

      "Cute patterns|||B0C8HLJZ78 ★★★★☆ <b>Cute ribbon, but all individual rolls</b> This is cute, thin ribbon with several different Christmas themed prints. It will certainly work as intended for gift wrapping. I took of one star though for two reasons: First, these all come as little individual spools, not two large spools as it looks like in the product pictures. That makes storage and keeping track of them more difficult. Second, the spools on the individual rolls of ribbon do not go all the way to the end of the spooled ribbon. As a result, as soon as you undo the tape holding the roll together about half the roll will just fall off since there is no spool supporting it. Again, not a big deal though as you will have to use about that much ribbon to wrap around a gift anyway.",

It was also a huge quantity for the money and very nice quality. It came spooled around a piece of foam which worked well. It does not have any wire to it and had a soft flowy feel instead. It is not glittery, but shiny and see-through. I found that it cut well with sharp fabric scissors that had not dulled on other things.

However, it is not a thick ribbon. If you use too hefty a needle when sewing then the fibers show every point and it creases easily.

The texture is matte, not shiny, which I prefer. Each spool has 5 yards of ribbon for a total of 15 yards. The price seems a bit high for this type of ribbon and I’m sure it’s due to the wooden spools. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. Sometimes having reusable wooden spools is exactly why I’ve made a specific purchase. This ribbon can be used in a variety of ways. I’ll be using when wrapping Christmas gifts, for hanging ornaments on my Christmas tree, and for embellishing fall/winter clothes I’ll be sewing for my granddaughters. I’ll add pictures when I can.

Each year I craft homemade sauces, rubs, or other food gifts that I usually package in jars topped with a bit of colorful cloth. But when I ran out of narrow, delicate ribbon last year I was at a loss. Most traditional ribbon is either too thick or too stiff – or both – so it simply doesn’t work well for that type of task. This Vitalizart ribbon is practically perfect for my wrapping needs. It’s soft, supple, ties easily, and it stays in place. I think the small wooden spools are a lovely touch. They're so much classier than a cardboard spool – plus with the white ribbon they remind me of a little stack of double-stuffed Oreos. Cute! BOTTOM LINE: The Vitalizart satin ribbon is a well-made, quality product. And at a price-point of about $7 (at the time of this review), it’s an extremely good value for gift-wrap or crafting.",

      "Soft neutral tones|||B09QS757YZ ★★★★★ <b>*Nice set of cotton ribbon!*</b> I got this ribbon in the \"Incanus & Green\" set & I really appreciate & chose this brand & color since they're made of COTTON!!! :D (Many ribbons on Amazon are made of polyester & I was first going to choose the \"Green\" set made by this company, but that is the only set in their ad that is made of polyester, so I chose the \"Incanus & Green\" cotton set instead! :) It's nice quality, thin but durable ribbon & I like the \"rustic\" frayed edges of them! The colors I received are soft, neutral tones & the ribbon can be used for a variety of projects. I wish the darker \"Green\" set in their ad was also made of cotton (since that's the set that would've been my first choice for the decorative project I'm using the ribbon for) but I always choose cotton over polyester whenever I can, so that's why I chose the cotton \"Incanus & Green\" set instead of the polyester \"Green\" set. I really appreciate the company's effort in making most of their ribbons out of cotton instead of polyester, so that they're biodegradable whenever they someday wind up in the trash/dump...(as happens with everything in life eventually...nothing lasts forever lol.) So I heartily applaud & appreciate this company's more natural & eco-conscious approach by making their ribbon mostly out of cotton versus other companies who use polyester. I also like the simplistic, natural brown paper packaging the ribbon comes in. Decorating shouldn't have to be harmful to the environment & this company helps to achieve that! *Thank you!!* :D",

      "color is lighter and more orange toned than expected|||B0CJ286HCC ★★★★☆ <b>Slight More Orange Toned, Thinner Than Expected</b> PROS: - It is a lovely ribbon on both sides; the main is the velvet, and the reverse is a cream backing, so it can pull double duty and I worry less about laying it perfectly. - It comes pinned, not taped, which is a small but appreciated thing for me. NEUTRALS: - The ribbons are a bit thinner than I expected; most of my velvet ribbons are completely opaque, but these you are able to see your finger through if you’re holding it. Since I’m just using this for wrapping and small designs, it’s not a major issue for me personally. CONS: - The ribbon is both lighter and more orange toned than it appeared in the listing images (I checked it under different light sources). I would call it a brown orange over a khaki for sure. - The ends fray if you don’t use incredibly sharp shears. DIRECTLY GIFTABLE?: Sure, it’s just a plain white ribbon wheel, wrapped in plastic. Nothing notable really. CONCLUSION: - It’s a nice ribbon, but the color and fray potential is why it still landed at four stars for me. I wouldn’t go out of my way to recommend it, but I wouldn’t advise against it either.",

      "Vibrant colors|||B07RT1Q1DM ★★★☆☆ <b>Ugh - Twist Ties !!! But vibrant colors</b> The colors are vibrant, and the ribbon is a nice thick quality, but unlike other buyers who were pictured here , my ribbon DIDNT COME ROLLED. Instead it came crimped with those horrible little wired bread ties which leaves a forever mark in velvet; so not all 36” is usable. That having been said, the colors of this lot were as follows: the navy was deep - almost black. The emerald green was spot on old fashioned green (think beleek) and the forest green is deep and rich. The blue is a robins egg, not a teal as in many of the pics. The gray is a pigeon color, and the yellow is a rich warm marigold. The maroon is a rich garnet, and the peach is a true baby peach. As for the pinks: the pale is a true baby girl pink, the hot pink is somewhere between Barbie pink and strawberry, and the red is a cool true red. The purple however is not a royal rich purple. It is more like a vibrant joyful lilac - very eastery. Hope this helps anyone wondering about colors !",

Than cut the tulle into approximately 4” wide pieces, and tie onto the ribbon, putting each closely together on the ribbon. No need to tie in a knot, just tie once ((like you do when tying shoe laces), just be sure to cinch tightly. Same technique as for making a rag garland.",

      "vivid colors|||B09XM6ZN1Q ★★★★★ <b>Very Pretty Ribbons in Lots of Colors</b> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these 20 ribbons of 20 different colors. I like to use ribbons for card making, and these have just the right width (3/8 inch) and are DOUBLE-SIDED. It really looks so much better when tying bows, if the ribbon is double-sided. It just doesn’t look tidy when the “bad side” of a one sided ribbon shows up after tying a bow. Other Positives: 1) The colors are vivid, there are 20 colors. Two of the colors are gold and silver. The gold and silver are shimmery and has a grosgrain look to it. 2) The ribbons have a smooth, satin finish to it. It is made of 100% polyester. Very easy to work with and making bows. The cut ends will fray. Sometimes I use a bit of glue on the ends to stop the fraying. 3) As soon as I saw all the colors, I thought of all the different cards I can make. Red ribbon for Valentine’s and Christmas, Orange and black for Halloween, blue for July 4th, etc. 4) Value priced, too at 48 cents a spool. There are 15 yards per roll for a total of 300 yards. This will last me a long time. These ribbons are great to have on hand for crafting, gift wrapping, or party events. I recommend them for value and quality.",

They are not thin by any means and really have a nice weight and quality. Not sheer at all. The prints are only on one side (except the red and black gingham, that is the same on both sides) and that is not a problem at all as most ribbon is that way, just wanted to mention that. Perfect for your farmhouse creations. Timeless prints too! The wire is nice and sturdy. Colors are vibrant.

It’s very soft and Christmasy looking – not red but a deeper elegant touch to your crafts. I would say that it may be more expensive than what I would typically pay for something similar.

      "Cool true red|||B07RT1Q1DM ★★★☆☆ <b>Ugh - Twist Ties !!! But vibrant colors</b> The colors are vibrant, and the ribbon is a nice thick quality, but unlike other buyers who were pictured here , my ribbon DIDNT COME ROLLED. Instead it came crimped with those horrible little wired bread ties which leaves a forever mark in velvet; so not all 36” is usable. That having been said, the colors of this lot were as follows: the navy was deep - almost black. The emerald green was spot on old fashioned green (think beleek) and the forest green is deep and rich. The blue is a robins egg, not a teal as in many of the pics. The gray is a pigeon color, and the yellow is a rich warm marigold. The maroon is a rich garnet, and the peach is a true baby peach. As for the pinks: the pale is a true baby girl pink, the hot pink is somewhere between Barbie pink and strawberry, and the red is a cool true red. The purple however is not a royal rich purple. It is more like a vibrant joyful lilac - very eastery. Hope this helps anyone wondering about colors !",

It made everything I decorated with it pop and look wonderful. It was easy to make bows with it and the wire on the edges makes them hold their shape.

      "Vibrant colors|||B0922M29Z4 ★★★☆☆ <b>The count came up short</b> This is the product you buy for the price and the quantity, not the quality. We all know it. So I was happy to see a pretty nice set of ribbons when I opened my Amazon box. The colors are vibrant, they were packaged very neatly, and the ribbon was rolled on a round piece of styrofoam. I compared the ribbon to some from the craft store and they are pretty close. This ribbon was a little thinner and the ribs were longer but they felt exactly the same. I’d pick this ribbon as it has the best price. Where the issues showed up were when I went to rewrap each of these onto the flat cardboard bobbins I prefer. I’ve included photos showing the things I found. The silver/grey had a defective area of about 5” right in the middle of the row. The peach/light coral one is two toned the entire length, with one edge much lighter than the other. Some of them, like the yellow are really kinked. I’m not sure how as they were rolled, but there are definitely distinct kinks there. I really hope they relax on their own as I don’t feel like fussing with them. Not a bad thing but you should know that the orange, lime green, and yellow are really neon color. Super bright. The biggest issue is the cut. Of the 24 rolls only 4 are the correct length. 12 rolls, half of the total number, are shorter than 4 yards each. The difference was 1.5 to 7 inches short each. A total of 39.25 inches were missing, more than a yard. The remaining 8 rolls were longer than 4 yards, with the same differences. Maybe they think it balances out? To me it didn’t matter as I have no set lengths I need. But to those of you looking for exactly 4 yards you should probably keep shopping. The ribbon wasn’t too stiff. It’s just like all the other grosgrain ribbon I have. I really do like colors, it’s a great selection. Even with the issues I’d buy this product again. It really is the best price.",

Hersteller 20 m sein, nachgemessen habe ich aber nicht. Die Vorder- und Rückseite des Bandes sind etwas unterschiedlich glänzend und dieses Band sieht zu einer Schleife gebunden sehr edel aus. Ich werde es mir für besondere Geschenke zurücklegen. Ein kleiner Tipp von mir: Wenn man so ein schönes Band mehrfach verwenden möchte (für Weihnachtsdeko z.B.), dann kann man Knicke und Falten ganz einfach wegbügeln, wenn man das Bügeleisen auf ganz schwache Hitze stellt.

      "Vibrant colors|||B0CB5M64Q7 ★★★★★ <b>I love this ribbon although it's a little difficult sometimes</b> This wired ribbon has a strong wire, which has good and bad effects. It holds well and you can have crisp positioning; on the downside, because the wire is stronger and holds the shape better, it’s slightly difficult to position. The colors/prints are vibrant with minimal loose strings from rough/scissor cuts, and in my opinion the ribbon doesn’t need the tips sealed. The patterns are *chef’s kiss* and I love that I found a good ribbon to work with my “Who” themed year.",

      "Made in China|||B09XM6ZN1Q ★★★★☆ <b>We had a lot of fun threading pony beads onto the green 💚 today</b> These really nice multicolored skinny ribbons can be used for all kinds of arts and crafts. Cards scrapbooking adorning clothing, hats you name it this sky's the limit. I like how the 20 colors of 100 yards of ribbon come in a nice display package with little indentations to keep each roll. That's really neat. I did notice that a couple of my 🌈 rainbow colors had less on the roll than the other rolls had, so I don't know what's up with that but every inch counts. Today my mom and I decided to string some really nice pony beads I'm also testing onto a length of the lime green ribbon. To make sure that the beads would stay on for my mom we knotted one near the bottom of one end of the length that I kind of measured not with tape just kind of put it around my neck and figured out how big I'd want it for it to go over her neck easy. Since we both shake with essential tremor, I wanted to make it easier for her to string the thin ribbon into the big pony bead openings. So I wrapped some Scotch tape around the other end. I wish I could show you that first video I made for you guys. I had it too thick and somehow I also had it the tape on slow motion? So it's really weird but it would take too long to upload I'm sure. Also my mom was joking with me and pulling the tip of the ribbon away so I couldn't stick the little bead on. It was funny you had to be there I guess haha just imagine it. 😜 Anyway, I made the tape narrower and it finally worked perfectly for my mom to string the beads on. It gives her practice with patterning and remembering colors and just hand eye coordination and all those mental gymnastics we need to do to keep our aging brains sharp. Plus she loves jewelry so making her own is even better. It's great how this pack of ribbon gives you so many colors at once without you having to buy 10,000 yards of each. Made in China.",

It’s been super useful for birthday gifts to Christmas wrapping to extra hair ribbon for my daughter.",
      "Neatly packaged in a box|||B0C8HLJZ78 ★★★★★ <b>Very cute set of Christmas ribbon!</b> These are neatly packaged in a box and are a really cute set of ribbons for Christmas! It seems like nice quality ribbon and almost all of the printing images/text on them are done well and are clear. There are two rolls - one with snowmen and one with gnomes that are just a little bit blurry. Not quite as clear as they should be, but not terrible. I will certainly still use them. The ribbon isn't colored on both sides - the back is white, if that matters to you. For some of my projects that would be fine, but others it would be nice if the back was the same overall color as the front. And this really isn't a big deal, but I'd like it better if the box opened where you could see all the different ribbon and you could use it to store them in.

Missing ribbon? - I would not pay the asking price of about $5 for 25 yards of ribbon. - Not a super shiny silver - more of a flat, greyish silver. My photo makes it look shinier than it actually is (probably caused by the flash). **** Buyer beware!",

However, it is small, very small, and not overly substantive in any way. It's quality is on par with the 8-9 dollar ribbon/10 yards...so saying all of that, in my humble opinion you are by FAR better off getting one of those!

      "Eco-friendly cardboard packaging|||B0BWF4SJ1T ★★★★★ <b>Beautiful, soft, distinctive</b> This ribbon is lovely. Packaged in eco-friendly cardboard, this set of three rolls of ribbon is quality stuff. The ribbon is soft and drapes, ties, and folds nicely. The weave of the fabric is delicate, and the frayed edges give it a special touch. I’m going to use this ribbon on my wedding bouquet (the ivory color perfectly matches my dress). It would be gorgeous on gifts or even tying up a ponytail! I really like this ribbon.",

I hope I can find another use for them once the ribbon is gone 🤞🏻 There is a good amount of high-quality ribbon on each spool, plenty for wrapping multiple gifts (depending on size.)

      "Protectively packaged in a reusable cardboard box|||B0C33MW9CY ★★★★★ <b>Make the ordinary extraordinary</b> Four rolls of rich deep forest green chiffon ribbon. Frayed edges are casually elegant; the silky, soft texture drapes beautifully. Uniform color. There are so many uses: gift wrapping, covering bouquet stems, embellishing hand-made cards, tying decorative book stacks, crafts, and so much more. They are beautiful and will make the ordinary extraordinary. The ribbons were protectively packaged in a reusable cardboard box and arrived undamaged. I love these gorgeous ribbons and look forward to using them."

      "plain white ribbon wheel, wrapped in plastic|||B0CJ286HCC ★★★★☆ <b>Slight More Orange Toned, Thinner Than Expected</b> PROS: - It is a lovely ribbon on both sides; the main is the velvet, and the reverse is a cream backing, so it can pull double duty and I worry less about laying it perfectly. - It comes pinned, not taped, which is a small but appreciated thing for me. NEUTRALS: - The ribbons are a bit thinner than I expected; most of my velvet ribbons are completely opaque, but these you are able to see your finger through if you’re holding it. Since I’m just using this for wrapping and small designs, it’s not a major issue for me personally. CONS: - The ribbon is both lighter and more orange toned than it appeared in the listing images (I checked it under different light sources). I would call it a brown orange over a khaki for sure. - The ends fray if you don’t use incredibly sharp shears. DIRECTLY GIFTABLE?: Sure, it’s just a plain white ribbon wheel, wrapped in plastic. Nothing notable really. CONCLUSION: - It’s a nice ribbon, but the color and fray potential is why it still landed at four stars for me. I wouldn’t go out of my way to recommend it, but I wouldn’t advise against it either.",

      "Simplistic natural brown paper|||B09QS757YZ ★★★★★ <b>*Nice set of cotton ribbon!*</b> I got this ribbon in the \"Incanus & Green\" set & I really appreciate & chose this brand & color since they're made of COTTON!!! :D (Many ribbons on Amazon are made of polyester & I was first going to choose the \"Green\" set made by this company, but that is the only set in their ad that is made of polyester, so I chose the \"Incanus & Green\" cotton set instead! :) It's nice quality, thin but durable ribbon & I like the \"rustic\" frayed edges of them! The colors I received are soft, neutral tones & the ribbon can be used for a variety of projects. I wish the darker \"Green\" set in their ad was also made of cotton (since that's the set that would've been my first choice for the decorative project I'm using the ribbon for) but I always choose cotton over polyester whenever I can, so that's why I chose the cotton \"Incanus & Green\" set instead of the polyester \"Green\" set. I really appreciate the company's effort in making most of their ribbons out of cotton instead of polyester, so that they're biodegradable whenever they someday wind up in the trash/dump...(as happens with everything in life eventually...nothing lasts forever lol.) So I heartily applaud & appreciate this company's more natural & eco-conscious approach by making their ribbon mostly out of cotton versus other companies who use polyester. I also like the simplistic, natural brown paper packaging the ribbon comes in. Decorating shouldn't have to be harmful to the environment & this company helps to achieve that! *Thank you!!* :D"

      "Rolled around a core in a cellophane envelope, but with no chip board sides|||B08P9NPY3P ★★☆☆☆ <b>EXTREMELY THIN AND NOT DOUBLE FACED</b> As the old adage goes, “You get what you pay for”, KINDA? VALUE: If this ribbon was going to the trash with wrapping paper, $4.99 for 100 yards is a good value. I’m giving the supplier credit that there actually are 100 yards on the roll. Unfortunately I bought this ribbon to serve as page markers for a Bible rebind. So, this ribbon is just too cheap looking and flimsy for that use. Value for me is zero. QUALITY: mediocre to poor, extremely thin material with almost invisible edge detail. PACKAGING: Unlike ribbon sold at brick and mortar stores, this roll came rolled around a core and in a cellophane envelope, but with no chip board sides to prevent the entire roll from falling off the sides of the core and totally tangling. PRODUCT LISTENING: Sold as Dark Red Double Faced Color is subjective but this roll of Dk Red appears to this purchaser to be closer to Light Red Wine in color. With a decidedly different texture on the reverse side, it is highly doubtful that this can be considered “Double Faced”. SUMMARY: If you are looking for ribbon for decoration, say for hair ribbons or seasonal decor, or for more permanent items like sewing into a dress or to make book markers, look elsewhere. If you only want to tie up a quick gift, or need wine colored string, go for it."

It is not glittery, but shiny and see-through. I found that it cut well with sharp fabric scissors that had not dulled on other things.

I also have the 3/8\" Burgundy, 3/8\" Navy and 1\" Navy - all are on a cardboard spool that makes it really easy to handle and store. This 1\" Burgundy ribbon is just wrapped around a flat, circular piece of foam. I am worried about the whole thing unraveling. I am still able to use the ribbon and the result is exactly what I wanted. The lack of spool doesn't affect the actual quality of the product at all, just the ease of use and storage.

      "comes on a styrofoam spool with no ridges|||B08M5QMQLP ★★★☆☆ <b>Cheaper ribbon, but great quantity for the price.</b> I bought this product to use for multiple projects, and so far it has served its purpose well. One thing that I noticed immediately about the product was the packaging. It comes on a styrofoam spool with no ridges to hold it in place. I find it near impossible to store, and even more impossible to wrap the excess up when I am done using it. If the ribbon came on a cardboard spool with edges to keep it in place, I might have given this product another star. This might not be something that bothers anyone else, but if you are looking to store it and use it on multiple different projects, I suggest finding a different spool to store the ribbon on. Other than that, the ribbon was of decent quality. As I said, you get great yardage for the price, but the ribbon does feel a bit cheaper. There is one side that is clearly a more shiny satin than the other. Additionally, the ribbon is a bit see-through. Further, when cut with scissors, the ribbon almost immediately frays, as seen in the attached photos. This is a problem with any ribbon but was especially noticeable with this one. I have yet to attempt to seal it with a lighter, but I am not sure how well that would work as the ribbon immediately disintegrates into a million strings after you cut it. Overall, if you are looking to do a project that requires a large amount of ribbon and you aren't too worried about the quality, then I suggest this product. But, if you are looking for ribbon to use throughout multiple projects, or want a nicer quality ribbon, then I suggest you look elsewhere.",

For the money and the amount you get the price was excellent! Also the ribbon is beautiful and easy to work with. The only downfall was the ribbon was placed on a center round Styrofoam piece and as soon as you take it out of the plastic package, it stated to unravel. The easy fix for that was to just get it rolled back up tight and place it back into the packaging it came in and then take a pair of scissors and cut a slit in the side of the packaging and then thread the end of the ribbon out through it. It stays nice that way and you don't have it unravelling all over the place when you are using it. I am going to buy more colors. It's just beautiful ribbon!",

      "cute wooden spool|||B0CBPG8CWC ★★★★★ <b>Stunning</b> I loooove wrapping presents, specifically Christmas 😂 I always have a white snowy Christmas as my theme. These are going to go great with the wrapping I’ve purchased. It’s so delicate and beautiful. So soft and easy to work with. It will be perfect for smaller gifts, as it is tiny. Which I love. They are on the cutest wooden spool 🥲 LOVE that! Can be used a million ways!",
      "Wooden spools|||B0BYJRX8DJ ★★★★★ <b>Lovely Ribbon and a Great Value</b> When I saw the Vitalizart white satin ribbon I immediately ordered it for holiday gift wrapping. Each year I craft homemade sauces, rubs, or other food gifts that I usually package in jars topped with a bit of colorful cloth. But when I ran out of narrow, delicate ribbon last year I was at a loss. Most traditional ribbon is either too thick or too stiff – or both – so it simply doesn’t work well for that type of task. This Vitalizart ribbon is practically perfect for my wrapping needs. It’s soft, supple, ties easily, and it stays in place. I think the small wooden spools are a lovely touch. They're so much classier than a cardboard spool – plus with the white ribbon they remind me of a little stack of double-stuffed Oreos. Cute! BOTTOM LINE: The Vitalizart satin ribbon is a well-made, quality product. And at a price-point of about $7 (at the time of this review), it’s an extremely good value for gift-wrap or crafting.",
      "Wooden spools|||B0C7V2QHNM ★★★★★ <b>Gorgeous!</b> I would not usually describe ribbon as gorgeous, but this is the exception! Even the packaging is cute with little wooden spools. I chose the burnt orange color and think it's very rich. The ribbon has a little sheen to it. It isn't metallic but there's just a little bit of shine, which I really like because it makes it look even fancier. I plan to use this for Christmas decorating (going a bit non-traditional this year) by putting small bows on the tree. So glad I got this!",
      "Wooden spools|||B0BYJRX8DJ ★★★★★ <b>Beautiful ribbon</b> I got the 3 gold ribbon pack to make a graduation lei for my son and this did not disappoint. the ribbon was beautiful.

      "Comes on wooden spools|||B0B9J9HG5Z ★★★★★ <b>Lovely</b> One of the big reasons that I got this ribbon was for the wooden spool that I would like to use to decorate with. The ribbon itself was lovely and soft. Even my husband liked the feel of the velvet. I look forward to using this ribbon in projects in the future. Ribbon, lace and thread are supplies that I keep on hand so I can make projects without running to the store. Our nearest fabric store being a 42 mile round trip. This velvet ribbon will also be useful when making fancy cards. I appreciate the opportunity to try these out. Thank you."

      "wooden spools|||B0BZPSYWHQ ★★★★☆ <b>Very pretty for small projects, strange wood debris</b> There was some tiny wood debris (It looked like shavings leftover from the wooden spools) all over the ribbon spools when I unboxed them. The velvet material clings to stuff like that, so I had to brush them off and lint roll them. I really wish the seller had done more cleanup on the spools so that wouldn't have happened, but the ribbon itself is fine with lovely colors. Just know if you're doing a larger project--say you need to make multiple gift baskets--you can quickly run out of a color. The amount on the spools is pretty small. These will definitely work for my needs, and I'm happy."

So I really did want it to work out.

The colors I received are soft, neutral tones & the ribbon can be used for a variety of projects. I wish the darker \"Green\" set in their ad was also made of cotton (since that's the set that would've been my first choice for the decorative project I'm using the ribbon for) but I always choose cotton over polyester whenever I can, so that's why I chose the cotton \"Incanus & Green\" set instead of the polyester \"Green\" set. I really appreciate the company's effort in making most of their ribbons out of cotton instead of polyester, so that they're biodegradable whenever they someday wind up in the trash/dump...(as happens with everything in life eventually...nothing lasts forever lol.) So I heartily applaud & appreciate this company's more natural & eco-conscious approach by making their ribbon mostly out of cotton versus other companies who use polyester. I also like the simplistic, natural brown paper packaging the ribbon comes in. Decorating shouldn't have to be harmful to the environment & this company helps to achieve that! *Thank you!!* :D",

Ich bin auch nicht enttäuscht worden. Die Farbe ist wirklich toll. Auch die Qualität des Bandes kann überzeugen. Die Breite ist ca. 10 cm, die Länge soll lt. Hersteller 20 m sein, nachgemessen habe ich aber nicht. Die Vorder- und Rückseite des Bandes sind etwas unterschiedlich glänzend und dieses Band sieht zu einer Schleife gebunden sehr edel aus. Ich werde es mir für besondere Geschenke zurücklegen. Ein kleiner Tipp von mir: Wenn man so ein schönes Band mehrfach verwenden möchte (für Weihnachtsdeko z.B.), dann kann man Knicke und Falten ganz einfach wegbügeln, wenn man das Bügeleisen auf ganz schwache Hitze stellt. Fazit: Einn wirklich, tolles, dekoratives Band, allerdings auch nicht günstig.",
      "Satin material|||B0BNV7R9BM ★★★★★ <b>schönes, breites Satinband!</b> Geliefert werden ca. 20m Satinband, das 10cm breit ist. Auf einer Seite glänzt es schön matt. Die rote Farbe ist kräftig und sieht toll aus. Ich bin eine begeisterte Bastlerin und habe das FAKILO Geschenkband für meine Basteleien und Dekoprojekte bestellt. Das Satinband in rot ist für Dekoration und Geschenkverpackung gut geeignet. Es kann leicht mit einer Schere geschnitten werden. Die Enden franzen nur leicht aus. Das kann man auch völlig verhindern, indem man die Schnitt-Enden vorsichtig mit einem Feuerzeug erhitzt. Ich kann es weiterempfehlen. Vielen Dank, dass Sie sich die Zeit genommen haben, meine Rezension zu lesen. Ich hoffe, ich konnte Ihnen bei Ihrer Kaufentscheidung damit ein wenig behilflich sein und dass die Rezension nützlich für Sie war.",

I was able to use up my stash of disposable ribbon last year. This year I'll be using thick satin ribbon on all my gifts, with a sprig of cedar or holly tucked into the bow. This is perfect for that!

I do wedding photography and use the ribbons when styling a lay flat which is usually of the wedding couples’ details. Ya, brides don’t provide those things so we bring them lol. I also photograph newborns and milestones and these ribbons would really well for tiebacks and headbands that we make custom for our client closets. I love creating delicate outfits and accessories for my sweet little babies. The color is definitely a chocolate shade of champagne but very pretty.

If the length is actually 100 yards, it's very reasonable. At the time of this review this product 1/8th inch wide, black satin, two sided ribbon. Smooth and shiny on both sides. This is a delicate, yet strong, slim and pretty ribbon that can be used for so many purposes. For me, I am making bracelets and necklaces and am making display and creative textiles, and fabric cord details to replace traditional chains. I'll update with more information as I use it, but for 100 yards, this is a reasonable value that includes the cost of shipping. I am happy with this order, and the ribbon is exactly what I was looking for and it is exactly correct in texture, color, width and thickness. 5 stars",

Although you could use this for wrapping presents, I will save it for craft projects. There are larger spools of some colors than others. I plan to mount a dowel to thread these onto to make them more accessible. Otherwise, you have to leave them tied up in the bag or you’ll just have 20 spools thrown into a drawer. Recommended.",

I am able to use this with my sewing machine, and while it was really difficult to fold and iron flat- it doesn't hold a crease very well and I couldn't get it to fold straight- it held up fabulously under my sewing machine. The satin is soft and pliable, not plastic feeling, and it didn't melt from the iron, even on the hottest setting. I'm using it as a hem for a rainbow petticoat, so I won't be washing it, but I think it would be okay to send through the washer and dryer, since it didn't melt from the iron. The colors are very vibrant and true to the picture.",

It can easily hold its shape and stay upright (instead of flopping over) when tied into a bow. The ribbon cuts easily and nicely without fraying and leaving little threads behind. The length is plenty long to have ribbon for a small to medium DIY project.",

It is has a thinner hand than Offray with a somewhat paper-like quality and lacks the luster of the more expensive ribbons. Still, though, it has a very pleasing sheen and is an excellent choice for beautiful wrapping and crafts. One note: The sage color I purchased was a gray green.

I wanted a good quality double faced satin ribbon to wrap gifts so that the recipient would then have very nice ribbon to use as well as the gift.

My mom is planning the shower for our church family and local friends, so I'm helping her make all of the decorations. One of my favorite things we made was a DIY satin ribbon garland/banner. This was such a fun & easy project! I cut the ribbon colors into 3'(ish) long strips, then used a lighter to melt/seal the ends. After that, I folded each ribbon piece in half and made a slipknot around a piece of paracord. I alternated the colors until the garland was about 5-6 feet long. I'm going to hang it either across the front of a table or on the wall. I love that I can then save this and re-use it for baby's first birthday party!

The texture is matte, not shiny, which I prefer. Each spool has 5 yards of ribbon for a total of 15 yards. The price seems a bit high for this type of ribbon and I’m sure it’s due to the wooden spools. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. Sometimes having reusable wooden spools is exactly why I’ve made a specific purchase. This ribbon can be used in a variety of ways. I’ll be using when wrapping Christmas gifts, for hanging ornaments on my Christmas tree, and for embellishing fall/winter clothes I’ll be sewing for my granddaughters. I’ll add pictures when I can.

      "100% polyester|||B09XM6ZN1Q ★★★★★ <b>Very Pretty Ribbons in Lots of Colors</b> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these 20 ribbons of 20 different colors. I like to use ribbons for card making, and these have just the right width (3/8 inch) and are DOUBLE-SIDED. It really looks so much better when tying bows, if the ribbon is double-sided. It just doesn’t look tidy when the “bad side” of a one sided ribbon shows up after tying a bow. Other Positives: 1) The colors are vivid, there are 20 colors. Two of the colors are gold and silver. The gold and silver are shimmery and has a grosgrain look to it. 2) The ribbons have a smooth, satin finish to it. It is made of 100% polyester. Very easy to work with and making bows. The cut ends will fray. Sometimes I use a bit of glue on the ends to stop the fraying. 3) As soon as I saw all the colors, I thought of all the different cards I can make. Red ribbon for Valentine’s and Christmas, Orange and black for Halloween, blue for July 4th, etc. 4) Value priced, too at 48 cents a spool. There are 15 yards per roll for a total of 300 yards. This will last me a long time. These ribbons are great to have on hand for crafting, gift wrapping, or party events. I recommend them for value and quality."

      "Grosgrain ribbon|||B0922M29Z4 ★★★☆☆ <b>The count came up short</b> This is the product you buy for the price and the quantity, not the quality. We all know it. So I was happy to see a pretty nice set of ribbons when I opened my Amazon box. The colors are vibrant, they were packaged very neatly, and the ribbon was rolled on a round piece of styrofoam. I compared the ribbon to some from the craft store and they are pretty close. This ribbon was a little thinner and the ribs were longer but they felt exactly the same. I’d pick this ribbon as it has the best price. Where the issues showed up were when I went to rewrap each of these onto the flat cardboard bobbins I prefer. I’ve included photos showing the things I found. The silver/grey had a defective area of about 5” right in the middle of the row. The peach/light coral one is two toned the entire length, with one edge much lighter than the other. Some of them, like the yellow are really kinked. I’m not sure how as they were rolled, but there are definitely distinct kinks there. I really hope they relax on their own as I don’t feel like fussing with them. Not a bad thing but you should know that the orange, lime green, and yellow are really neon color. Super bright. The biggest issue is the cut. Of the 24 rolls only 4 are the correct length. 12 rolls, half of the total number, are shorter than 4 yards each. The difference was 1.5 to 7 inches short each. A total of 39.25 inches were missing, more than a yard. The remaining 8 rolls were longer than 4 yards, with the same differences. Maybe they think it balances out? To me it didn’t matter as I have no set lengths I need. But to those of you looking for exactly 4 yards you should probably keep shopping. The ribbon wasn’t too stiff.

Attached are pictures of what I got from Humphrey’s craft( the grosgrain ribbon) and double face satin ribbon (from hobby lobby) so y’all could see the difference. The price for the ribbon is good for the amount you get just wish I could have gotten the satin ribbon I had ordered. Other than that the ribbon is still nice and I’ll probably use it for something else just not on the orders that I needed satin ribbon for."

This year, I decided to do elegant with gold wrapping paper and black velvet ribbon. PROS: - This ribbon is beautiful and exactly what I was thinking of/hoping for. It 100% elevates my presents and makes them look very luxurious. - It doesn't fray! LOVE that. I have had ribbon fray before, and it's not fun. CONS: - Unlike normal ribbon, the velvet is only one-sided, so when I wrap bows or tie knots, you can see the backside and it is not cute. - Cutting the velvet creates some fuzz! It's not annoying or anything, but can cause a mess when you're wrapping in excess. - It really isn't a lot... I bought three of these spools thinking it would be enough. I typically wrap my presents with that \"T\" shape, but doing that was going to make me go broke, especially with the amount of presents I am wrapping. I ended up buying more spools and just wrapping the ribbon around once. OVERALL: I still really love this ribbon and highly recommend it. If you are not great at tying bows I would suggest you do some research (if this is what you are using it for), as it can look really tacky if the ribbon is not laying right.",

The pink color is accurately represented, and the plush face of the ribbon looks really nice. The downside is the same with any velvet ribbon -- it's inherently challenging to work with for tying bows. That is true with every velvet ribbon I've ever had, so I do not consider that a flaw in the product. That's just the nature of velvet. If you've never worked with velvet ribbon before, just know that part going in. I am not using this ribbon for sewing, but having handled it and examined it, I do think that it would be appropriate for a sewing project. The material is on the heavier side, it doesn't have a wired edge, and it doesn't seem to fray too badly. If you plan to use a straight cut end, you might need to add a little fray-stop liquid to keep the end nice and straight. But again, that's true with any velvet ribbon.",

Such a great value for how much you get, and would definitely order in multiple colors. Velvet flocking is on one-side only and the other side is more satin-y. Ties easily and stays secured.",

NEUTRALS: - The ribbons are a bit thinner than I expected; most of my velvet ribbons are completely opaque, but these you are able to see your finger through if you’re holding it. Since I’m just using this for wrapping and small designs, it’s not a major issue for me personally. CONS: - The ribbon is both lighter and more orange toned than it appeared in the listing images (I checked it under different light sources). I would call it a brown orange over a khaki for sure. - The ends fray if you don’t use incredibly sharp shears. DIRECTLY GIFTABLE?: Sure, it’s just a plain white ribbon wheel, wrapped in plastic. Nothing notable really. CONCLUSION: - It’s a nice ribbon, but the color and fray potential is why it still landed at four stars for me.

It 100% elevates my presents and makes them look very luxurious. - It doesn't fray! LOVE that. I have had ribbon fray before, and it's not fun. CONS: - Unlike normal ribbon, the velvet is only one-sided, so when I wrap bows or tie knots, you can see the backside and it is not cute. - Cutting the velvet creates some fuzz! It's not annoying or anything, but can cause a mess when you're wrapping in excess. - It really isn't a lot... I bought three of these spools thinking it would be enough. I typically wrap my presents with that \"T\" shape, but doing that was going to make me go broke, especially with the amount of presents I am wrapping. I ended up buying more spools and just wrapping the ribbon around once. OVERALL: I still really love this ribbon and highly recommend it. If you are not great at tying bows I would suggest you do some research (if this is what you are using it for), as it can look really tacky if the ribbon is not laying right.",

Based on several other reviews I read beforehand (such as \"great deal\" & \"large spool\" & referencing how \"big\" the 50 yard roll is) I was expecting it to be more substantial than what showed up. I do realize $6-$7 isn't crazy, but you get what you get for it. The ribbon does seem of nice quality, just wish there was a little more of it.",

This is a delicate, yet strong, slim and pretty ribbon that can be used for so many purposes. For me, I am making bracelets and necklaces and am making display and creative textiles, and fabric cord details to replace traditional chains. I'll update with more information as I use it, but for 100 yards, this is a reasonable value that includes the cost of shipping. I am happy with this order, and the ribbon is exactly what I was looking for and it is exactly correct in texture, color, width and thickness. 5 stars",

      "Skinny ribbons|||B09XM6ZN1Q ★★★★☆ <b>We had a lot of fun threading pony beads onto the green 💚 today</b> These really nice multicolored skinny ribbons can be used for all kinds of arts and crafts. Cards scrapbooking adorning clothing, hats you name it this sky's the limit. I like how the 20 colors of 100 yards of ribbon come in a nice display package with little indentations to keep each roll. That's really neat. I did notice that a couple of my 🌈 rainbow colors had less on the roll than the other rolls had, so I don't know what's up with that but every inch counts. Today my mom and I decided to string some really nice pony beads I'm also testing onto a length of the lime green ribbon. To make sure that the beads would stay on for my mom we knotted one near the bottom of one end of the length that I kind of measured not with tape just kind of put it around my neck and figured out how big I'd want it for it to go over her neck easy. Since we both shake with essential tremor, I wanted to make it easier for her to string the thin ribbon into the big pony bead openings. So I wrapped some Scotch tape around the other end. I wish I could show you that first video I made for you guys. I had it too thick and somehow I also had it the tape on slow motion? So it's really weird but it would take too long to upload I'm sure. Also my mom was joking with me and pulling the tip of the ribbon away so I couldn't stick the little bead on. It was funny you had to be there I guess haha just imagine it. 😜 Anyway, I made the tape narrower and it finally worked perfectly for my mom to string the beads on. It gives her practice with patterning and remembering colors and just hand eye coordination and all those mental gymnastics we need to do to keep our aging brains sharp. Plus she loves jewelry so making her own is even better. It's great how this pack of ribbon gives you so many colors at once without you having to buy 10,000 yards of each. Made in China.",

It is worth noting that this set is NOT the standard 5/8\" (15mm) size; it's smaller. That's fine for me, because it's fun to mix and match the patterns together on an envelope.",

      "Thin ribbon|||B0C8HLJZ78 ★★★★☆ <b>Cute ribbon, but all individual rolls</b> This is cute, thin ribbon with several different Christmas themed prints. It will certainly work as intended for gift wrapping. I took of one star though for two reasons: First, these all come as little individual spools, not two large spools as it looks like in the product pictures. That makes storage and keeping track of them more difficult. Second, the spools on the individual rolls of ribbon do not go all the way to the end of the spooled ribbon. As a result, as soon as you undo the tape holding the roll together about half the roll will just fall off since there is no spool supporting it. Again, not a big deal though as you will have to use about that much ribbon to wrap around a gift anyway.",

      "3/8 inch width|||B09XM6ZN1Q ★★★★★ <b>Very Pretty Ribbons in Lots of Colors</b> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these 20 ribbons of 20 different colors. I like to use ribbons for card making, and these have just the right width (3/8 inch) and are DOUBLE-SIDED. It really looks so much better when tying bows, if the ribbon is double-sided. It just doesn’t look tidy when the “bad side” of a one sided ribbon shows up after tying a bow. Other Positives: 1) The colors are vivid, there are 20 colors. Two of the colors are gold and silver. The gold and silver are shimmery and has a grosgrain look to it. 2) The ribbons have a smooth, satin finish to it. It is made of 100% polyester. Very easy to work with and making bows. The cut ends will fray. Sometimes I use a bit of glue on the ends to stop the fraying. 3) As soon as I saw all the colors, I thought of all the different cards I can make. Red ribbon for Valentine’s and Christmas, Orange and black for Halloween, blue for July 4th, etc. 4) Value priced, too at 48 cents a spool. There are 15 yards per roll for a total of 300 yards. This will last me a long time. These ribbons are great to have on hand for crafting, gift wrapping, or party events. I recommend them for value and quality.",

      "Thin ribbon|||B08M5QMQLP ★★★★☆ <b>Great for Crafts Ideas!</b> Bottomline: This ribbon is a great addition to the current craft projects I have going on. Especially with Mother's Day around the corner, there's an endless amount of possibilities of what you can do with this ribbon to turn something simple and customize it with your own style. I chose the red ribbon and I've already started wrapping with it. Because of how thin the ribbon is, this would be better for smaller gifts if you'd like to wrap a ribbon around it. Or, you can also tie this to the handle of a bag to make it a little different. Larger gifts might require thicker or wider bows, and therefore this might not be appropriate by itself. It can work as a compliment to a bigger bow. I typically go for ribbons with wires just because they're a little easier to work with when you need the ribbon to conform to a specific angle or shape, but this wasn't difficult to use. The only thing that I would say is that if you typically tape or staple your ribbons sometimes to keep them in place, this isn't the ribbon that's going to cooperate well. Hot glue guns might be better to use when working with this ribbon to get it to form a particular shape or angle. Some examples of craft projects I'm currently working on are using these ribbons on small vases and wrapping of small items for jewelries and handmade bracelets. The feel of the ribbon felt okay. It didn't feel as soft as I expected but more like paper. I would still get this again but in different colors for other DIY projects I'm thinking about.",

The texture is matte, not shiny, which I prefer. Each spool has 5 yards of ribbon for a total of 15 yards. The price seems a bit high for this type of ribbon and I’m sure it’s due to the wooden spools. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. Sometimes having reusable wooden spools is exactly why I’ve made a specific purchase. This ribbon can be used in a variety of ways. I’ll be using when wrapping Christmas gifts, for hanging ornaments on my Christmas tree, and for embellishing fall/winter clothes I’ll be sewing for my granddaughters. I’ll add pictures when I can. I recommend this item only if you plan to reuse the wooden spools once the ribbon has been used.",

It creates amazing interest when trailing through a photo of an invitation suite or curled around the wedding rings. The ribbon actually appears 2-sided. One side is clearly shiny, the other is more matte. The fraying is natural, but tidy. My favorite part of this set, though, is the inclusion of the spools!! I’ve been hoping to add spools to my detail kit… and here they are! They are also the perfect size. Enough to add pop and interest to a picture, but not so large or bulky to take away from the actual bridal details themselves. My only wish would be to have the option to mix and match colors. Since this ribbon is not for a specific craft or one-use project in my case, I would prefer a choice of colors rather than 3 spools of the same color. But, I’d still buy another Vitalizart set.

The high-quality velvet feels soft and lush, and what's more, it avoids the overly shiny look that some ribbons tend to have. The subdued sheen enhances the overall elegance of the product. Non-Slip and Secure: One of the key highlights is the non-slip nature of this ribbon. Whether creating bows or simply hanging ornaments, the ribbon holds everything securely in place. No more slipping or sliding, just perfectly arranged bows that stay put.

The colors I received are soft, neutral tones & the ribbon can be used for a variety of projects. I wish the darker \"Green\" set in their ad was also made of cotton (since that's the set that would've been my first choice for the decorative project I'm using the ribbon for) but I always choose cotton over polyester whenever I can, so that's why I chose the cotton \"Incanus & Green\" set instead of the polyester \"Green\" set. I really appreciate the company's effort in making most of their ribbons out of cotton instead of polyester, so that they're biodegradable whenever they someday wind up in the trash/dump...(as happens with everything in life eventually...nothing lasts forever lol.) So I heartily applaud & appreciate this company's more natural & eco-conscious approach by making their ribbon mostly out of cotton versus other companies who use polyester. I also like the simplistic, natural brown paper packaging the ribbon comes in. Decorating shouldn't have to be harmful to the environment & this company helps to achieve that! *Thank you!!* :D",

It's strips of velvet fabric cut into ribbons with raw edges. It is a thinner material (you can see light through it if you hold it up to the light), but that also makes it much softer and more \"flowy\" than other velvet ribbons. The green color is a dark evergreen and is perfect for Christmas. Keep in mind, since it's more like a raw cut fabric rather than a traditional ribbon, it does fray on the cut end.",

I usually don't buy ribbon until after the holidays (when it's all on sale), but I saw this and the price was good, so I gave it a shot and ordered it. You won't be disappointed. Wired edges are strong and wire is fully enclosed in fabric. The ribbon itself looks like excellent quality (not cheap or thin) and it help up outdoors on a wreath for 2 weeks thru wind, rain & snow. Did not fade nor begin to fray at edges. If you are using it for bow making, you will need some finger/hand strength to gather and hold the ribbon, as it is a thicker material ribbon.

One small gripe, though: The roll I received is full of bends - not wrinkles, bends. I'm not sure if I received a somewhat defective batch, or not, but there are actual creases in the fabric. I tried ironing about a 2 foot piece, but I'm pretty sure it began to melt. Not only would I be unable to use a piece of ribbon that's half-melted, LOL, but I wouldn't be able to dedicate the time needed to press it. I already wish there were more hours in the day as it is, haha. I tried to pull (for lack of better terms. I'm not \"usina muh werds good\", I suppose, LOL) the ribbon flat, but that just left me with a stretched out piece of ribbon that was longer down the center than it was at the edges. Bummer. I gave this four stars as it's a beautiful color, a nice thickness, and I AM able to use it for the reason in which I purchased it. It's a great price, and I'm more likely than not to buy it again, but will keep my fingers crossed that I receive a wrinkle/bend-free spool next time!",

It is an affordable choice for sewing compared to Offray or Mokuba but won't give the rich luxurious folds that a better-quality ribbon will support. It is has a thinner hand than Offray with a somewhat paper-like quality and lacks the luster of the more expensive ribbons. Still, though, it has a very pleasing sheen and is an excellent choice for beautiful wrapping and crafts. One note: The sage color I purchased was a gray green. In fact, when I first opened it I thought I’d received gray. I’ve taken a picture of it against white notebook paper and a US $10 bill to help judge color.

It has a nice shine on both sides which makes it great for bows, bouquet wraps, centerpieces or adding to just about any wedding craft. You don't have to alter the way that you tie or sew it. However, it is not a thick ribbon. If you use too hefty a needle when sewing then the fibers show every point and it creases easily. It is not sheer at all which could be a bonus depending on your needs. I am finding success with a small needle and an added backing. Not for long term crafts.",

Beautiful color red, a true Christmas red. I purchased two sizes—narrow and the 1 1/2” wide, both red. And the reds matched! Neither width ribbon frayed nor tore. It was such nice ribbon that people saved the ribbon/bows from their gifts rather than tossing them in the trash as they had in the past. I had always used florist ribbon for gift wrapping until this year. Ribbon is always pricey, but this ribbon was a great value for the price. I plan to reorder.",

      "5 yards long per spool|||B0C33MW9CY ★★★★★ <b>Delicate, gauzy ribbons</b> As someone who gifts my handknits regularly, I tend to be very aware that whatever packaging I put things in just becomes clutter. I've taken to just wrapping blankets, sweaters, etc. in a ribbon for the presentation. This ribbon is quite beautiful. I choose a sage green, so that it's neutral on any gift. It's very delicate and the frayed edges look so pretty on packages. The ribbon is about 1.5 inches wide and 5 yards long per spool. (You get 4 spools in the package.) This means I can wrap quite a few packages in this ribbon. at 1.5 inches, I tend to use this for smaller packages, with thinner yarn. it's more of a summer wrap. Because the chiffon is thin, this is very gauzy, so be aware that it's not a robust, satiny ribbon. It's very very delicate. I like it a lot.",

I bought the 50 yard spool and used nearly all of it on 8 chair backs & bows. The ribbon was very easy to work with, stayed where put, and holds the bow exactly as desired.

      "Five yards per spool|||B0CB5M64Q7 ★★★★☆ <b>Nice variety</b> My sister is a little obsessed with the Grinch and when I saw this pack of ribbons I knew that her gifts had to be adorned with them. This is a nice set of spools of ribbon with six different Grinch-y designs. Each spool has five yards of wired ribbon. Two of the ribbons are glitter based and the other four are plain. The ribbons are of good quality and the designs are clear and crisp. The variety is great as you can match the more obvious Grinch themes with the more neutral. Of course, you can use them singly as well. These are good enough quality that they can be used for packages but also for more decor related crafts. Adorning a tree, dressing up a swag, a design element of porch pots, using them as part of a tablescape in your dining room for a dinner party, all of these would be great places to utilize these ribbons. If you use them indoors and are careful about how you pack them away I think you could even get multiple seasons worth of use from them. At less than $3 per roll they seem reasonably priced.",

There're also great for hanging ornaments or using when making Christmas themed crafts etc. We love the patterns, festive designs and Christmas colors....it all helps in creating a joyful Christmas atmosphere.

      "100 yards of ribbon|||B09XM6ZN1Q ★★★★☆ <b>We had a lot of fun threading pony beads onto the green 💚 today</b> These really nice multicolored skinny ribbons can be used for all kinds of arts and crafts. Cards scrapbooking adorning clothing, hats you name it this sky's the limit. I like how the 20 colors of 100 yards of ribbon come in a nice display package with little indentations to keep each roll. That's really neat. I did notice that a couple of my 🌈 rainbow colors had less on the roll than the other rolls had, so I don't know what's up with that but every inch counts. Today my mom and I decided to string some really nice pony beads I'm also testing onto a length of the lime green ribbon. To make sure that the beads would stay on for my mom we knotted one near the bottom of one end of the length that I kind of measured not with tape just kind of put it around my neck and figured out how big I'd want it for it to go over her neck easy. Since we both shake with essential tremor, I wanted to make it easier for her to string the thin ribbon into the big pony bead openings. So I wrapped some Scotch tape around the other end. I wish I could show you that first video I made for you guys. I had it too thick and somehow I also had it the tape on slow motion? So it's really weird but it would take too long to upload I'm sure. Also my mom was joking with me and pulling the tip of the ribbon away so I couldn't stick the little bead on. It was funny you had to be there I guess haha just imagine it. 😜 Anyway, I made the tape narrower and it finally worked perfectly for my mom to string the beads on. It gives her practice with patterning and remembering colors and just hand eye coordination and all those mental gymnastics we need to do to keep our aging brains sharp. Plus she loves jewelry so making her own is even better. It's great how this pack of ribbon gives you so many colors at once without you having to buy 10,000 yards of each. Made in China.",

I measured the fire engine red at 4 yards, and even the white which looked to be the most ample was 6 inches short of 5 yards. Truth in advertising is not always a requirement for these products.

      "100 yards on the roll|||B08P9NPY3P ★★☆☆☆ <b>EXTREMELY THIN AND NOT DOUBLE FACED</b> As the old adage goes, “You get what you pay for”, KINDA? VALUE: If this ribbon was going to the trash with wrapping paper, $4.99 for 100 yards is a good value. I’m giving the supplier credit that there actually are 100 yards on the roll. Unfortunately I bought this ribbon to serve as page markers for a Bible rebind. So, this ribbon is just too cheap looking and flimsy for that use. Value for me is zero. QUALITY: mediocre to poor, extremely thin material with almost invisible edge detail. PACKAGING: Unlike ribbon sold at brick and mortar stores, this roll came rolled around a core and in a cellophane envelope, but with no chip board sides to prevent the entire roll from falling off the sides of the core and totally tangling. PRODUCT LISTENING: Sold as Dark Red Double Faced Color is subjective but this roll of Dk Red appears to this purchaser to be closer to Light Red Wine in color. With a decidedly different texture on the reverse side, it is highly doubtful that this can be considered “Double Faced”. SUMMARY: If you are looking for ribbon for decoration, say for hair ribbons or seasonal decor, or for more permanent items like sewing into a dress or to make book markers, look elsewhere. If you only want to tie up a quick gift, or need wine colored string, go for it.",

This gives me an opportunity to learn how to make little ribbon roses for my crochet projects. If you need a very nice ribbon I recommend this ribbon. No disappointment in this choice.",

      "Inconsistent lengths (some shorter, some longer than 4 yards)|||B0922M29Z4 ★★★☆☆ <b>The count came up short</b> This is the product you buy for the price and the quantity, not the quality. We all know it. So I was happy to see a pretty nice set of ribbons when I opened my Amazon box. The colors are vibrant, they were packaged very neatly, and the ribbon was rolled on a round piece of styrofoam. I compared the ribbon to some from the craft store and they are pretty close. This ribbon was a little thinner and the ribs were longer but they felt exactly the same. I’d pick this ribbon as it has the best price. Where the issues showed up were when I went to rewrap each of these onto the flat cardboard bobbins I prefer. I’ve included photos showing the things I found. The silver/grey had a defective area of about 5” right in the middle of the row. The peach/light coral one is two toned the entire length, with one edge much lighter than the other. Some of them, like the yellow are really kinked. I’m not sure how as they were rolled, but there are definitely distinct kinks there. I really hope they relax on their own as I don’t feel like fussing with them. Not a bad thing but you should know that the orange, lime green, and yellow are really neon color. Super bright. The biggest issue is the cut. Of the 24 rolls only 4 are the correct length. 12 rolls, half of the total number, are shorter than 4 yards each. The difference was 1.5 to 7 inches short each. A total of 39.25 inches were missing, more than a yard. The remaining 8 rolls were longer than 4 yards, with the same differences. Maybe they think it balances out? To me it didn’t matter as I have no set lengths I need. But to those of you looking for exactly 4 yards you should probably keep shopping. The ribbon wasn’t too stiff. It’s just like all the other grosgrain ribbon I have. I really do like colors, it’s a great selection. Even with the issues I’d buy this product again. It really is the best price.",

      "short length of each color (1 yard)|||B09MBZC8Q8 ★★★☆☆ <b>Nice, with a couple of issues.</b> This ribbon looks nice enough if you just need something to use to hang thinga with, but I was disappointed for several reasons. The first is my fault: I really didn't do the math well when I ordered this, and I just didn't realize how short a length I would get off each color. Some of these colors are gorgeous, but others I know I'm unlikely to use again. That tends to mean the colors I don't like will pile up, if I try to re-purchase more of the ones I do like - and that will happen quickly, with only 1 yard of each color. I really, really hate the way these were packed. The product picture shows each color rolled separately, but that's not what you get. Instead, you get about a half-dozen large rolls, which contain multiple colors. Without unrolling each one, it's impossible to see what's there. Because of this before I could even use the ribbon, I spent an hour and a half unrolling the big rolls and making small, individual rolls with each color. After that, I can see and access them all easily. But honestly, I really had much better things to do with my time than repack 30 yards of ribbon. The quality isn't bad. I had hoped for thicker ribbon, as I planned to use these to make necklaces and I want them to last. A thicker pile to the ribbon would prevent it from wrinkling too easily, and would keep it from looking prematurely worn. Anything I make from these, I will have to charge a bit less for and warn customers that the necklace cord will eventually wear out. What I do like: many of these colors are stunning. It is nice to have a sampler to allow me to figure out what I need most. I really hope that they hold up better than I am expecting. Time will tell. If all you need is ribbons for trim, or to hang ornaments from, these are a good choice. I think, however, they for my purposes, I am going to have to keep looking for higher quality.",

      "no chemical smell|||B0BNV7R9BM ★★★★★ <b>Dickes, glänzendes Satinband</b> Ich liebe es, Geschenke schön zu verpacken, weshalb ich mich sehr gefreut habe, dieses FAKILO Geschenkband mit einer Breite von 10cm und ca. 20m Länge testen zu dürfen. Es sieht genauso toll aus wie auf dem Produktfoto. Da es sich hierbei um Satinband handelt, ist es sehr glatt und glänzend. Ferner handelt es sich um ein stabiles, dickes Band, welches man sehr gut mit dem Bügeleisen zum Wiederbenutzen glätten kann, wenn man vorher einen festen Knoten gemacht hat. Da es als Rolle geliefert wurde, war es nicht zerknittert. Einen chemischen Geruch konnte ich ebenfalls nicht feststellen. Ich werde es nicht nur zum Verpacken von Geschenken benutzen, sondern auch damit basteln oder nähen. Das Band ist absolut empfehlenswert!"

      "Chemical smell|||B0716G21C2 ★★★★☆ <b>Good for the price, but wouldn’t buy again</b> Not quite what I was looking for, but for the quantity/price I’ll be keeping it. As with any online purchase, colors can be hard to decipher. The red ribbon has more orange in it than I would have liked. It’s not a smooth, silky satin either. It’s double sided but still has a little bit of that crunchy feel to it (but still a nicer quality than that really cheap stuff). Final complaint is that it has a weird, chemical smell to it. Hoping that dissipates...",
      "Chemical smell|||B09L7P8ZFK ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Very disappointed…</b> I have never wrote a review but felt inclined to do so after receiving this package. When I received this product the packaging was fine but upon opening I realized that the ribbon was very damp and had a chemical smell. I have attached a picture where you can see the wet cardboard. The ribbon was already untied and coming off the round cardboard as soon as I opened it. The ribbon itself seems fine just a little wet. Very disappointed to find this for the money I spent…",
      "Overwhelming toxic smell|||B07Z4MD5ZL ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Overwhelming Toxic Smell</b> These ribbons are beautiful but they have an overwhelming toxic smell to them - almost like gasoline or oil. I tried to air them out in my kitchen but they smelled so bad after 5 min out of the package that I got a headache. I don’t feel safe handling these ribbons as I don’t want the chemicals on my hands nor under our tree!",

My mistake. The smell of chemicals was so bad I got an instant headache, and my husband on the far side of the room could smell it. So far the ribbon has been unraveled and airing out on the clothesline outside for 4 days now, and it still reeks. At this point I'm not even sure if I'll be able to use it.",

      "chemical smell|||B0CKZ43XBZ ★☆☆☆☆ <b>Ungesund</b> Sieht schön aus. Das ist aber auch schon alles. Der Geruch ist penetrant Chemie. Wir haben alle Kopfschmerzen bekommen. Mit Mundschutz entsorgt.",
      "strong chemical smell|||B07Z4MD5ZL ★★☆☆☆ <b>Very Sloppy. Pictures are misleading and ribbons were crammed in bag.</b> Half of the ribbons were crammed in a small plastic bag. They were not on organized or separated. When I opened the package to take one ribbon out, they all came out and were a tangled mess. I had to separate each ribbon and roll them to prevent more wrinkles, and for storage. The other half of ribbons came in a small plastic bag also, but at least were separated with ties. There was a horrible strong chemical smell on the ribbons! I will air out a day or so before deciding to return or keep."

      "odorless|||B0BNV7R9BM ★★★★★ <b>Sehr schönes, leicht glänzendes Geschenkband</b> Ich durfte das Geschenkband von FAKILO in der Farbe Weinrot testen. Das Band ist auf einer kleinen Papprolle aufgewickelt und in Folie und einer Pappschachtel verpackt. Das Band macht qualitativ einen guten Eindruck auf mich. Die Farbe ist schön kräftig und das Material glänzt leicht, wie es für Satin üblich ist. Für meine Nase ist das Material völlig geruchsneutral. Der Preis ist für 20 Meter völlig in Ordnung. Kann das Geschenkband auf jeden Fall empfehlen, egal ob zur Verpackung von Geschenken oder zu Deko-Zwecken. Von mir gibt es daher auf jeden Fall 5 Sterne."

The color is exactly as pictured on the photo. It’s a nice shiny “old gold” color that will be prefect for holiday vibes without being Christmas theme. It’s a nice soft pliable ribbon that is easy to shape and tie so it works perfect for my use. It’s also the perfect size for small bows for a little pop of color on holiday presents. My only complaint is that it tends to fray where it is cut. This is fixed by using a lighter to melt the ends and stop the fraying. Overall I think it’s a good quality for the cheap price since and you get a lot of ribbon for your money. I would recommend.",

I found the exact brown deco mesh with copper threads on Amazon. This mesh I ordered, is such a better mesh then what I started with. When I cut the 10 by 10 pieces there was little to no fraying. For this size mesh roll it is even $3 cheaper than what I’ve been paying at my local craft store. I was delighted to see they have a wide selection of colors to include 4 roll combo packs.
