        "Tying around trees & utility poles<<<Length of 22 yards per roll|||B09P33DZXR ★★☆☆☆ [2023-03-25] <b>Pretty ribbons but beware of length</b> I bought 10 these ribbons. I was expecting these ribbons to be of a certain length (22 yards PER roll) when I received them. These ribbons were purchased to be cut in certain lengths to be tied around trees & utility poles. FOUR of the ten rolls were not a consecutive 22 yards. They were cut & another piece taped on. It was like they ran out of ribbon so they added scrap ribbon to make up the difference. This caused my measure to be inaccurate for what I needed. Otherwise, the ribbon itself was a beautiful shade of pink, they were soft, the satin seemed like good quality but did gray easily."

I actually bought this to make big labels. My sewing machine has a couple of fonts on and I can write things with it. I wanted to make a black stripe on a hand towel that had my dad’s name, apt# and phone. I found that running the ribbon through the sewing machine gave it wavy edges. It still worked but it really wants to warp even as I was sewing. So the text is a bit diagonal on the ribbon. I am planning to use this for packages from now on. It’s lovely ribbon."

This is for Breast Cancer awareness, so it really needed to be pink. It's peach. It's not even close to pink. Since the front cardboard label was torn off (which is the part that has the name of the color of the ribbon), it makes me wonder if someone ran out of pink and just substituted this hoping it would work. If that's what happened, it doesn't work - at all. If that's not what happened, this is fraudulent marketing. This is not pink - not by a long shot. The picture is definitely pink, but this ribbon is definitely peach. Won't be returning since that's too much trouble...so I'm stuck with peach ribbon that won't work for my Breast Cancer awareness.... So disappointed!

        "Small vase decoration|||B08M5QMQLP ★★★★☆ [2023-05-09] <b>Great for Crafts Ideas!</b> Bottomline: This ribbon is a great addition to the current craft projects I have going on. Especially with Mother's Day around the corner, there's an endless amount of possibilities of what you can do with this ribbon to turn something simple and customize it with your own style. I chose the red ribbon and I've already started wrapping with it. Because of how thin the ribbon is, this would be better for smaller gifts if you'd like to wrap a ribbon around it. Or, you can also tie this to the handle of a bag to make it a little different. Larger gifts might require thicker or wider bows, and therefore this might not be appropriate by itself. It can work as a compliment to a bigger bow. I typically go for ribbons with wires just because they're a little easier to work with when you need the ribbon to conform to a specific angle or shape, but this wasn't difficult to use. The only thing that I would say is that if you typically tape or staple your ribbons sometimes to keep them in place, this isn't the ribbon that's going to cooperate well. Hot glue guns might be better to use when working with this ribbon to get it to form a particular shape or angle. Some examples of craft projects I'm currently working on are using these ribbons on small vases and wrapping of small items for jewelries and handmade bracelets. The feel of the ribbon felt okay. It didn't feel as soft as I expected but more like paper. I would still get this again but in different colors for other DIY projects I'm thinking about.",
        "Vase centerpieces|||B0C9WKTQ6X ★★★★★ [2023-10-24] <b>Great for Crafting and Decor!</b> This is pretty nice ribbon for what works out to a mere $0.25 a yard! No, it's not super thick or high quality, but it has a beautiful sheen and is sturdy enough for most applications. I wouldn't use it on clothing because it's lacking that extra something something, but for the price, you do get pretty decent ribbon here. I used it for decor at a recent class reunion. I attached photos to lengths of ribbon for a wall display, and I used some to tie around vases for the table centerpieces. It kept the decorating costs low yet still looked stunning. 5 Stars."

It best assists when working with multiple materials and/or layers but is easiest to learn on single layered bows. This device would be most useful as a gift for individuals who experience pain, fatigue, or difficulty with fine motor movements. This set arrives with the main gadget, a ruler that slots on top and then a piece to evenly scrunch down your DIY bow. In addition, it also includes a CD-ROM, membership on the website and a roll of metallic tie. Personally, I feel as though the CD-ROM format is very dated; in order to access the tutorial, there is an application that must run. This did not launch on my computer and I could not gain access to it despite many attempts. I also accessed the website and the PDF walkthroughs to best understand how to complete a bow with the assistance of this device. It was well explained in the written guides online, with step-by-step instructions and visuals. The idea behind this tool is useful, but more-so for individuals looking for a quick way to assemble their scraps into a reusable and presentable form. A lot of the styles in the provided examples are dated and much more appropriate for an older crowd. The number one feature I found was that this holds your material in place while you assemble and tie it all together. Otherwise, it is a very simplistic device with more of a purpose for those who may have difficulty with fine motor skills but want to design and complete decorative bows on their own."

I bought it for wedding favors, but I’m very disappointed in the quality. The ribbon is wrinkled from the way it is rolled on the Styrofoam. Ironing it flattens it out, but I shouldn’t have to iron 150 feet of ribbon straight off the roll before I can use it! Also, on some of the ribbon the edge crimping was out of alignment and not actually on the edge (shown on the top ribbon in the 3rd picture). I can’t use the parts of the roll with defects like this. I will add, though, that I did end up talking to their customer support, and I must say that they do have great customer service!"

Ordered 2 varieties for 2 different companies. Although feel like same company but different sellers. On page looks like burlap-type fabric so was going to use on tree. In person, it's a cheesecloth/gauze type fabric. What gives it legs is the quality of the dye. The color, especially on the darker blue, is even with True to color hue. This set in Sky Blue, Navy & White is my fave to use on magnetic gift boxes. Most boxes have a gloss finish & the gauze in contrast looks simply tasteful. Plus the lightweight lets you layer colors to give more depth to the eye. You will need 3 hands to tie it on a glossy surface but the end result shines. The other set was in Burgundy, Pink & White but didn't figure out layering til the blue. No I am not redoing bows but this set has grown on me so give it a chance.

Ordered 2 varieties for 2 different companies. Although feel like same company but different sellers. On page looks like burlap-type fabric so was going to use on tree. In person, it's a cheesecloth/gauze type fabric. What gives it legs is the quality of the dye. The color, especially on the darker blue, is even with True to color hue. This set in Sky Blue, Navy & White is my fave to use on magnetic gift boxes. Most boxes have a gloss finish & the gauze in contrast looks simply tasteful. Plus the lightweight lets you layer colors to give more depth to the eye. You will need 3 hands to tie it on a glossy surface but the end result shines. The other set was in Burgundy, Pink & White but didn't figure out layering til the blue. No I am not redoing bows but this set has grown on me so give it a chance. Definitely can't find 15 yards of ribbon anywhere for 10 bucks so it's worth the shot."

It creates amazing interest when trailing through a photo of an invitation suite or curled around the wedding rings. The ribbon actually appears 2-sided. One side is clearly shiny, the other is more matte. The fraying is natural, but tidy. My favorite part of this set, though, is the inclusion of the spools!! I’ve been hoping to add spools to my detail kit… and here they are! They are also the perfect size. Enough to add pop and interest to a picture, but not so large or bulky to take away from the actual bridal details themselves. My only wish would be to have the option to mix and match colors. Since this ribbon is not for a specific craft or one-use project in my case, I would prefer a choice of colors rather than 3 spools of the same color. But, I’d still buy another Vitalizart set. The gray/silver is beautiful, and the price for their spooled ribbon is very affordable."

I like to use ribbons for card making, and these have just the right width (3/8 inch) and are DOUBLE-SIDED. It really looks so much better when tying bows, if the ribbon is double-sided. It just doesn’t look tidy when the “bad side” of a one sided ribbon shows up after tying a bow. Other Positives: 1) The colors are vivid, there are 20 colors. Two of the colors are gold and silver. The gold and silver are shimmery and has a grosgrain look to it. 2) The ribbons have a smooth, satin finish to it. It is made of 100% polyester. Very easy to work with and making bows. The cut ends will fray. Sometimes I use a bit of glue on the ends to stop the fraying. 3) As soon as I saw all the colors, I thought of all the different cards I can make. Red ribbon for Valentine’s and Christmas, Orange and black for Halloween, blue for July 4th, etc. 4) Value priced, too at 48 cents a spool. There are 15 yards per roll for a total of 300 yards. This will last me a long time. These ribbons are great to have on hand for crafting, gift wrapping, or party events. I recommend them for value and quality."

        "Party decorations|||B0C3QPPS6Y ★★★★★ [2023-06-24] <b>Very pretty ribbon for gifts or decor</b> This is very pretty ribbon for using as gift wrapping or for decoration. It would probably work well also as hair bows for babies/young children, or even to tie around a ponytail. The color is nice, and true to what it looks like in the picture here. I do think it is probably limited to one use, just given the fragility of the fabric, but for the cost I don’t think that’s unreasonable. This would also be great to make centerpieces for a party, shower, wedding, etc. paired with flowers or candle holders.",

This is a nice set of spools of ribbon with six different Grinch-y designs. Each spool has five yards of wired ribbon. Two of the ribbons are glitter based and the other four are plain. The ribbons are of good quality and the designs are clear and crisp. The variety is great as you can match the more obvious Grinch themes with the more neutral. Of course, you can use them singly as well. These are good enough quality that they can be used for packages but also for more decor related crafts. Adorning a tree, dressing up a swag, a design element of porch pots, using them as part of a tablescape in your dining room for a dinner party, all of these would be great places to utilize these ribbons. If you use them indoors and are careful about how you pack them away I think you could even get multiple seasons worth of use from them. At less than $3 per roll they seem reasonably priced."

I have two covers, one for Winter and one for Summer, but both covers have only four ties on the corners. One of the covers has stingy short ties, too short to easily tie. The other cover has generous satin ribbon ties. I ordered this ribbon to replace the short ties and to add ties for the middle loops. This ribbon is exactly as described and perfect for the project. It's more ribbon than I need but that's I okay. At this price point for a good quality ribbon I'm happy to have the extra ribbon and I'm sure I'll use it. This gives me an opportunity to learn how to make little ribbon roses for my crochet projects. If you need a very nice ribbon I recommend this ribbon. No disappointment in this choice."

This means I can wrap quite a few packages in this ribbon. at 1.5 inches, I tend to use this for smaller packages, with thinner yarn. it's more of a summer wrap.

VALUE: If this ribbon was going to the trash with wrapping paper, $4.99 for 100 yards is a good value. I’m giving the supplier credit that there actually are 100 yards on the roll. Unfortunately I bought this ribbon to serve as page markers for a Bible rebind. So, this ribbon is just too cheap looking and flimsy for that use. Value for me is zero. QUALITY: mediocre to poor, extremely thin material with almost invisible edge detail. PACKAGING: Unlike ribbon sold at brick and mortar stores, this roll came rolled around a core and in a cellophane envelope, but with no chip board sides to prevent the entire roll from falling off the sides of the core and totally tangling. PRODUCT LISTENING: Sold as Dark Red Double Faced Color is subjective but this roll of Dk Red appears to this purchaser to be closer to Light Red Wine in color. With a decidedly different texture on the reverse side, it is highly doubtful that this can be considered “Double Faced”. SUMMARY: If you are looking for ribbon for decoration, say for hair ribbons or seasonal decor, or for more permanent items like sewing into a dress or to make book markers, look elsewhere. If you only want to tie up a quick gift, or need wine colored string, go for it."

Cards scrapbooking adorning clothing, hats you name it this sky's the limit. I like how the 20 colors of 100 yards of ribbon come in a nice display package with little indentations to keep each roll. That's really neat. I did notice that a couple of my 🌈 rainbow colors had less on the roll than the other rolls had, so I don't know what's up with that but every inch counts. Today my mom and I decided to string some really nice pony beads I'm also testing onto a length of the lime green ribbon. To make sure that the beads would stay on for my mom we knotted one near the bottom of one end of the length that I kind of measured not with tape just kind of put it around my neck and figured out how big I'd want it for it to go over her neck easy. Since we both shake with essential tremor, I wanted to make it easier for her to string the thin ribbon into the big pony bead openings. So I wrapped some Scotch tape around the other end. I wish I could show you that first video I made for you guys. I had it too thick and somehow I also had it the tape on slow motion? So it's really weird but it would take too long to upload I'm sure. Also my mom was joking with me and pulling the tip of the ribbon away so I couldn't stick the little bead on. It was funny you had to be there I guess haha just imagine it. 😜 Anyway, I made the tape narrower and it finally worked perfectly for my mom to string the beads on. It gives her practice with patterning and remembering colors and just hand eye coordination and all those mental gymnastics we need to do to keep our aging brains sharp. Plus she loves jewelry so making her own is even better. It's great how this pack of ribbon gives you so many colors at once without you having to buy 10,000 yards of each. Made in China.",

Turns out this ribbon is softer and less structured than the other satins I have used. Not saying that is a bad thing, it's more of a style thing. This ribbon will produce more romantic looking bows. They will be flowy. I loved the color which will lend itself to school colors. It is super soft and cut easily. I like to add little touches of ribbon when I decorate and this will work for that as well. The burnt orange is also an awesome Autumn tone. Love it!"

Everything on Pinterest was a rustic vibe and that’s not really what our wedding feel was. Found these on Amazon and they were PERFECT. The box they came in surprised me because it looked so small I was worried that it wouldn’t have enough in it, but I ended up only using 1.5 of the 3 rolls that came with it. I did 1 large and 5 small bouquets, 2 mini bouquets for the flower girls (pictured), and 9 boutonnières. The handles were also super comfortable to hold onto since it was good quality material.",

Instead, its made of glitter that wipes away when you barely touch it, you cant take it into the rain, cause it will wash away before you have a chance to get dissaoppointed.

I like to use ribbons for card making, and these have just the right width (3/8 inch) and are DOUBLE-SIDED. It really looks so much better when tying bows, if the ribbon is double-sided. It just doesn’t look tidy when the “bad side” of a one sided ribbon shows up after tying a bow. Other Positives: 1) The colors are vivid, there are 20 colors. Two of the colors are gold and silver. The gold and silver are shimmery and has a grosgrain look to it. 2) The ribbons have a smooth, satin finish to it. It is made of 100% polyester. Very easy to work with and making bows. The cut ends will fray. Sometimes I use a bit of glue on the ends to stop the fraying. 3) As soon as I saw all the colors, I thought of all the different cards I can make. Red ribbon for Valentine’s and Christmas, Orange and black for Halloween, blue for July 4th, etc. 4) Value priced, too at 48 cents a spool. There are 15 yards per roll for a total of 300 yards.

        "Card making<<<Can be used for various arts and crafts|||B09XM6ZN1Q ★★★★☆ [2022-09-17] <b>We had a lot of fun threading pony beads onto the green 💚 today</b> These really nice multicolored skinny ribbons can be used for all kinds of arts and crafts. Cards scrapbooking adorning clothing, hats you name it this sky's the limit. I like how the 20 colors of 100 yards of ribbon come in a nice display package with little indentations to keep each roll. That's really neat. I did notice that a couple of my 🌈 rainbow colors had less on the roll than the other rolls had, so I don't know what's up with that but every inch counts. Today my mom and I decided to string some really nice pony beads I'm also testing onto a length of the lime green ribbon. To make sure that the beads would stay on for my mom we knotted one near the bottom of one end of the length that I kind of measured not with tape just kind of put it around my neck and figured out how big I'd want it for it to go over her neck easy. Since we both shake with essential tremor, I wanted to make it easier for her to string the thin ribbon into the big pony bead openings. So I wrapped some Scotch tape around the other end. I wish I could show you that first video I made for you guys. I had it too thick and somehow I also had it the tape on slow motion? So it's really weird but it would take too long to upload I'm sure. Also my mom was joking with me and pulling the tip of the ribbon away so I couldn't stick the little bead on. It was funny you had to be there I guess haha just imagine it. 😜 Anyway, I made the tape narrower and it finally worked perfectly for my mom to string the beads on. It gives her practice with patterning and remembering colors and just hand eye coordination and all those mental gymnastics we need to do to keep our aging brains sharp. Plus she loves jewelry so making her own is even better. It's great how this pack of ribbon gives you so many colors at once without you having to buy 10,000 yards of each. Made in China."

It doesn’t look like you could really sew it on to anything like clothing, but a good double-faced tape will let you use it to trim cards and other crafts. It’s very soft and Christmasy looking – not red but a deeper elegant touch to your crafts. I would say that it may be more expensive than what I would typically pay for something similar.

It was a nightmare! Since I didn't have backup ribbon, I had to keep cutting and starting over wasting most of the ribbon or wasting time trying to hide the black specks the best I could.

Especially with Mother's Day around the corner, there's an endless amount of possibilities of what you can do with this ribbon to turn something simple and customize it with your own style. I chose the red ribbon and I've already started wrapping with it. Because of how thin the ribbon is, this would be better for smaller gifts if you'd like to wrap a ribbon around it. Or, you can also tie this to the handle of a bag to make it a little different. Larger gifts might require thicker or wider bows, and therefore this might not be appropriate by itself. It can work as a compliment to a bigger bow. I typically go for ribbons with wires just because they're a little easier to work with when you need the ribbon to conform to a specific angle or shape, but this wasn't difficult to use. The only thing that I would say is that if you typically tape or staple your ribbons sometimes to keep them in place, this isn't the ribbon that's going to cooperate well. Hot glue guns might be better to use when working with this ribbon to get it to form a particular shape or angle. Some examples of craft projects I'm currently working on are using these ribbons on small vases and wrapping of small items for jewelries and handmade bracelets. The feel of the ribbon felt okay. It didn't feel as soft as I expected but more like paper. I would still get this again but in different colors for other DIY projects I'm thinking about."

This means I can wrap quite a few packages in this ribbon. at 1.5 inches, I tend to use this for smaller packages, with thinner yarn. it's more of a summer wrap.

Some come all squished together in a bag, and others are tied and put in a bag. It's not a huge deal, since I just hung them on a doorknob for a few days to get any wrinkles out and they were fine (you can iron them too).

Replacing drawstrings or shoe laces (use a lighter to seal end so they dont fray), so cute in hair, gift wrapping.. probably some other things. For me at least it's essential lol. The width of this is perfect for little hair bows, which is what I ordered for. I removed a star based on the length. One spool is only 25yards, but the listing claims it's 50 yards. Maybe I was supposed to receive 2 boxes/spools? I'm not sure. The price point is reasonable for 50y, but overpriced for only 25y...

This is a delicate, yet strong, slim and pretty ribbon that can be used for so many purposes. For me, I am making bracelets and necklaces and am making display and creative textiles, and fabric cord details to replace traditional chains. I'll update with more information as I use it, but for 100 yards, this is a reasonable value that includes the cost of shipping.

VALUE: If this ribbon was going to the trash with wrapping paper, $4.99 for 100 yards is a good value. I’m giving the supplier credit that there actually are 100 yards on the roll. Unfortunately I bought this ribbon to serve as page markers for a Bible rebind. So, this ribbon is just too cheap looking and flimsy for that use. Value for me is zero. QUALITY: mediocre to poor, extremely thin material with almost invisible edge detail. PACKAGING: Unlike ribbon sold at brick and mortar stores, this roll came rolled around a core and in a cellophane envelope, but with no chip board sides to prevent the entire roll from falling off the sides of the core and totally tangling. PRODUCT LISTENING: Sold as Dark Red Double Faced Color is subjective but this roll of Dk Red appears to this purchaser to be closer to Light Red Wine in color. With a decidedly different texture on the reverse side, it is highly doubtful that this can be considered “Double Faced”. SUMMARY: If you are looking for ribbon for decoration, say for hair ribbons or seasonal decor, or for more permanent items like sewing into a dress or to make book markers, look elsewhere. If you only want to tie up a quick gift, or need wine colored string, go for it.",

And it is so versatile I can hardly wait to make bows to include on gifts, for children's hair, and even decorations. The Bow-dabra comes with an instruction book which is great but the creators went the extra mile and included a DVD to demonstrate just what you can do with it. VERY nice. The DVD is divided into sections so you can go right to the type of bow you want to make. Or, you can watch the entire thing all the way through which I did. You can make tiny bows for hair, decorative bows for packages, bows that include foil decorations, berries, flowers, or anything you can think of to include in the bow. They even demonstrate how to use up old scraps of ribbon to make a gorgeous bow. And these bows can get massive! You just have to see it after purchasing the Bow-dabra. I am planning a Bow-dabra party for my friends, to show them what all it will do. Summer is a great time to start thinking about Christmas decorations and gift wrapping so it would be fun to let each guest make a bow of their choosing. The guests can either bring their own ribbon and decorations or I could provide those. Either way, it's more fun if you do it yourself and have something to show. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that each bow you make uses a gold wire that is conveniently included in the Bow-dabra box. There is enough for about 10 bows. Do you can get the hang of it before buying more wire. The wire is only used to hold the bow together, so you could probably find some other colors. But I love the gold. It adds elegance to every bow. This is the cutest and most useful craft item I have seen in a long time. You just have to get one and try it for yourself. I LOVE this!"

I do wedding photography and use the ribbons when styling a lay flat which is usually of the wedding couples’ details. Ya, brides don’t provide those things so we bring them lol. I also photograph newborns and milestones and these ribbons would really well for tiebacks and headbands that we make custom for our client closets.

        "making necklaces<<<thin ribbon|||B09MBZC8Q8 ★★★☆☆ [2020-09-26] <b>Nice, with a couple of issues.</b> This ribbon looks nice enough if you just need something to use to hang thinga with, but I was disappointed for several reasons. The first is my fault: I really didn't do the math well when I ordered this, and I just didn't realize how short a length I would get off each color. Some of these colors are gorgeous, but others I know I'm unlikely to use again. That tends to mean the colors I don't like will pile up, if I try to re-purchase more of the ones I do like - and that will happen quickly, with only 1 yard of each color. I really, really hate the way these were packed. The product picture shows each color rolled separately, but that's not what you get. Instead, you get about a half-dozen large rolls, which contain multiple colors. Without unrolling each one, it's impossible to see what's there. Because of this before I could even use the ribbon, I spent an hour and a half unrolling the big rolls and making small, individual rolls with each color. After that, I can see and access them all easily. But honestly, I really had much better things to do with my time than repack 30 yards of ribbon. The quality isn't bad. I had hoped for thicker ribbon, as I planned to use these to make necklaces and I want them to last. A thicker pile to the ribbon would prevent it from wrinkling too easily, and would keep it from looking prematurely worn. Anything I make from these, I will have to charge a bit less for and warn customers that the necklace cord will eventually wear out. What I do like: many of these colors are stunning. It is nice to have a sampler to allow me to figure out what I need most. I really hope that they hold up better than I am expecting. Time will tell. If all you need is ribbons for trim, or to hang ornaments from, these are a good choice. I think, however, they for my purposes, I am going to have to keep looking for higher quality."

        "making necklaces<<<may wear out prematurely|||B09MBZC8Q8 ★★★☆☆ [2020-09-26] <b>Nice, with a couple of issues.</b> This ribbon looks nice enough if you just need something to use to hang thinga with, but I was disappointed for several reasons. The first is my fault: I really didn't do the math well when I ordered this, and I just didn't realize how short a length I would get off each color. Some of these colors are gorgeous, but others I know I'm unlikely to use again. That tends to mean the colors I don't like will pile up, if I try to re-purchase more of the ones I do like - and that will happen quickly, with only 1 yard of each color. I really, really hate the way these were packed. The product picture shows each color rolled separately, but that's not what you get. Instead, you get about a half-dozen large rolls, which contain multiple colors. Without unrolling each one, it's impossible to see what's there. Because of this before I could even use the ribbon, I spent an hour and a half unrolling the big rolls and making small, individual rolls with each color. After that, I can see and access them all easily. But honestly, I really had much better things to do with my time than repack 30 yards of ribbon. The quality isn't bad. I had hoped for thicker ribbon, as I planned to use these to make necklaces and I want them to last. A thicker pile to the ribbon would prevent it from wrinkling too easily, and would keep it from looking prematurely worn. Anything I make from these, I will have to charge a bit less for and warn customers that the necklace cord will eventually wear out. What I do like: many of these colors are stunning. It is nice to have a sampler to allow me to figure out what I need most. I really hope that they hold up better than I am expecting. Time will tell.

        "Making jewelry<<<Can be threaded with pony beads|||B09XM6ZN1Q ★★★★☆ [2022-09-17] <b>We had a lot of fun threading pony beads onto the green 💚 today</b> These really nice multicolored skinny ribbons can be used for all kinds of arts and crafts. Cards scrapbooking adorning clothing, hats you name it this sky's the limit. I like how the 20 colors of 100 yards of ribbon come in a nice display package with little indentations to keep each roll. That's really neat. I did notice that a couple of my 🌈 rainbow colors had less on the roll than the other rolls had, so I don't know what's up with that but every inch counts. Today my mom and I decided to string some really nice pony beads I'm also testing onto a length of the lime green ribbon. To make sure that the beads would stay on for my mom we knotted one near the bottom of one end of the length that I kind of measured not with tape just kind of put it around my neck and figured out how big I'd want it for it to go over her neck easy. Since we both shake with essential tremor, I wanted to make it easier for her to string the thin ribbon into the big pony bead openings. So I wrapped some Scotch tape around the other end. I wish I could show you that first video I made for you guys. I had it too thick and somehow I also had it the tape on slow motion? So it's really weird but it would take too long to upload I'm sure. Also my mom was joking with me and pulling the tip of the ribbon away so I couldn't stick the little bead on. It was funny you had to be there I guess haha just imagine it. 😜 Anyway, I made the tape narrower and it finally worked perfectly for my mom to string the beads on. It gives her practice with patterning and remembering colors and just hand eye coordination and all those mental gymnastics we need to do to keep our aging brains sharp. Plus she loves jewelry so making her own is even better. It's great how this pack of ribbon gives you so many colors at once without you having to buy 10,000 yards of each. Made in China."

I had looked at the wrong place on the spool and thought the iron had only temporarily made a color change with the heat but in fact I found the place where I hit it with an iron and the dye is indeed gone. I’ve been shrinking ribbons for years by wetting and pressing and it’s never happened before. It’ll be a lovely ribbon for projects that won’t be laundered but I wouldn’t trust it to be color fast during laundering. I have not done a laundering color fastness test though."

They are not thin by any means and really have a nice weight and quality. Not sheer at all. The prints are only on one side (except the red and black gingham, that is the same on both sides) and that is not a problem at all as most ribbon is that way, just wanted to mention that. Perfect for your farmhouse creations. Timeless prints too! The wire is nice and sturdy. Colors are vibrant.

It's the trend where you wrap your front door to look like a present (1 band horizonatally, 1 band vertically and then put a bow at the intersection). Pretty easy to do and this material was perfect for the harsh outside weather. It has a velvety feel which makes it look expensive. After 2.5 months outside, it didn't lose even a bit of its color, and I kept the ribbon to reattempt the next year as well. For my standard-sized door, 1 of these was enough, although I only wrapped the front side to save on the material. Hope this helps :)"

I usually don't buy ribbon until after the holidays (when it's all on sale), but I saw this and the price was good, so I gave it a shot and ordered it. You won't be disappointed. Wired edges are strong and wire is fully enclosed in fabric. The ribbon itself looks like excellent quality (not cheap or thin) and it help up outdoors on a wreath for 2 weeks thru wind, rain & snow. Did not fade nor begin to fray at edges. If you are using it for bow making, you will need some finger/hand strength to gather and hold the ribbon, as it is a thicker material ribbon. Great for indoor or outdoor use & would highly recommend."

I am able to use this with my sewing machine, and while it was really difficult to fold and iron flat- it doesn't hold a crease very well and I couldn't get it to fold straight- it held up fabulously under my sewing machine. The satin is soft and pliable, not plastic feeling, and it didn't melt from the iron, even on the hottest setting. I'm using it as a hem for a rainbow petticoat, so I won't be washing it, but I think it would be okay to send through the washer and dryer, since it didn't melt from the iron. The colors are very vibrant and true to the picture.",

        "trim|||B09MBZC8Q8 ★★★☆☆ [2020-09-26] <b>Nice, with a couple of issues.</b> This ribbon looks nice enough if you just need something to use to hang thinga with, but I was disappointed for several reasons. The first is my fault: I really didn't do the math well when I ordered this, and I just didn't realize how short a length I would get off each color. Some of these colors are gorgeous, but others I know I'm unlikely to use again. That tends to mean the colors I don't like will pile up, if I try to re-purchase more of the ones I do like - and that will happen quickly, with only 1 yard of each color. I really, really hate the way these were packed. The product picture shows each color rolled separately, but that's not what you get. Instead, you get about a half-dozen large rolls, which contain multiple colors. Without unrolling each one, it's impossible to see what's there. Because of this before I could even use the ribbon, I spent an hour and a half unrolling the big rolls and making small, individual rolls with each color. After that, I can see and access them all easily. But honestly, I really had much better things to do with my time than repack 30 yards of ribbon. The quality isn't bad. I had hoped for thicker ribbon, as I planned to use these to make necklaces and I want them to last. A thicker pile to the ribbon would prevent it from wrinkling too easily, and would keep it from looking prematurely worn. Anything I make from these, I will have to charge a bit less for and warn customers that the necklace cord will eventually wear out. What I do like: many of these colors are stunning. It is nice to have a sampler to allow me to figure out what I need most. I really hope that they hold up better than I am expecting. Time will tell. If all you need is ribbons for trim, or to hang ornaments from, these are a good choice. I think, however, they for my purposes, I am going to have to keep looking for higher quality.",
        "Sewing|||B09ZXXPM6K ★★★★☆ [2023-05-19] <b>Nice ribbon, good value</b> This is a medium to lightweight double-faced satin ribbon that forms bows fairly well. It is an affordable choice for sewing compared to Offray or Mokuba but won't give the rich luxurious folds that a better-quality ribbon will support. It is has a thinner hand than Offray with a somewhat paper-like quality and lacks the luster of the more expensive ribbons. Still, though, it has a very pleasing sheen and is an excellent choice for beautiful wrapping and crafts. One note: The sage color I purchased was a gray green. In fact, when I first opened it I thought I’d received gray. I’ve taken a picture of it against white notebook paper and a US $10 bill to help judge color. Depending on your application I'd definitely recommend it.",

The quality seems just OK, nothing special. I got it for use on hand-sewed upcycled clothing projects, so time will tell, as will the number of washings. Maybe if the presentation was a little closer to the description, meaning, had it actually arrived on a spool, the initial perceived quality might be a tad higher. The lack of spool was so annoying that I was almost ready to return it. Then I discovered that the piece was actually 10 yards and 18 inches. So maybe they were aware of the spool thing and duked me some extra, which I appreciate. And the price was certainly in the right ballpark, so I’m keeping it.",

The pink color is accurately represented, and the plush face of the ribbon looks really nice. The downside is the same with any velvet ribbon -- it's inherently challenging to work with for tying bows. That is true with every velvet ribbon I've ever had, so I do not consider that a flaw in the product. That's just the nature of velvet. If you've never worked with velvet ribbon before, just know that part going in. I am not using this ribbon for sewing, but having handled it and examined it, I do think that it would be appropriate for a sewing project. The material is on the heavier side, it doesn't have a wired edge, and it doesn't seem to fray too badly. If you plan to use a straight cut end, you might need to add a little fray-stop liquid to keep the end nice and straight. But again, that's true with any velvet ribbon."

Turns out this ribbon is softer and less structured than the other satins I have used. Not saying that is a bad thing, it's more of a style thing. This ribbon will produce more romantic looking bows. They will be flowy. I loved the color which will lend itself to school colors. It is super soft and cut easily.

I let its poor-quality go, though, since I intended to use it only for hanging ornaments on a little tree & I had no difficulty looping it into the ring of each of the small ornaments to be hung later in the year. That was before actually hanging them on the tree. Its lacking in body made it difficult to tie the bows whose little loops just hung, adding difficulty to completing the bow since I had to make the loops small just to get them to stand up. If you can imagine trying to make a bow with thread or string, you'll understand how that made a job which should have been pleasant a labor instead. It was also the first time that I had ribbon snag while I was working with it. Given all of the above, a 3-star rating is kind."

The texture is matte, not shiny, which I prefer. Each spool has 5 yards of ribbon for a total of 15 yards. The price seems a bit high for this type of ribbon and I’m sure it’s due to the wooden spools. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. Sometimes having reusable wooden spools is exactly why I’ve made a specific purchase. This ribbon can be used in a variety of ways. I’ll be using when wrapping Christmas gifts, for hanging ornaments on my Christmas tree, and for embellishing fall/winter clothes I’ll be sewing for my granddaughters. I’ll add pictures when I can. I recommend this item only if you plan to reuse the wooden spools once the ribbon has been used."

        "hanging ornaments|||B09MBZC8Q8 ★★★☆☆ [2020-09-26] <b>Nice, with a couple of issues.</b> This ribbon looks nice enough if you just need something to use to hang thinga with, but I was disappointed for several reasons. The first is my fault: I really didn't do the math well when I ordered this, and I just didn't realize how short a length I would get off each color. Some of these colors are gorgeous, but others I know I'm unlikely to use again. That tends to mean the colors I don't like will pile up, if I try to re-purchase more of the ones I do like - and that will happen quickly, with only 1 yard of each color. I really, really hate the way these were packed. The product picture shows each color rolled separately, but that's not what you get. Instead, you get about a half-dozen large rolls, which contain multiple colors. Without unrolling each one, it's impossible to see what's there. Because of this before I could even use the ribbon, I spent an hour and a half unrolling the big rolls and making small, individual rolls with each color. After that, I can see and access them all easily. But honestly, I really had much better things to do with my time than repack 30 yards of ribbon. The quality isn't bad. I had hoped for thicker ribbon, as I planned to use these to make necklaces and I want them to last. A thicker pile to the ribbon would prevent it from wrinkling too easily, and would keep it from looking prematurely worn. Anything I make from these, I will have to charge a bit less for and warn customers that the necklace cord will eventually wear out. What I do like: many of these colors are stunning. It is nice to have a sampler to allow me to figure out what I need most. I really hope that they hold up better than I am expecting. Time will tell. If all you need is ribbons for trim, or to hang ornaments from, these are a good choice. I think, however, they for my purposes, I am going to have to keep looking for higher quality.",

This is a nice set of spools of ribbon with six different Grinch-y designs. Each spool has five yards of wired ribbon. Two of the ribbons are glitter based and the other four are plain. The ribbons are of good quality and the designs are clear and crisp. The variety is great as you can match the more obvious Grinch themes with the more neutral. Of course, you can use them singly as well. These are good enough quality that they can be used for packages but also for more decor related crafts. Adorning a tree, dressing up a swag, a design element of porch pots, using them as part of a tablescape in your dining room for a dinner party, all of these would be great places to utilize these ribbons. If you use them indoors and are careful about how you pack them away I think you could even get multiple seasons worth of use from them. At less than $3 per roll they seem reasonably priced.",

I needed something to kind of fill in gaps and make my candy/sweets/candyland tree look more full and this worked perfectly. I had enough with one and a little bit of another to do my 6 foot tree in 3 full length sections and 3 half length sections. The only downside to this stuff is the edges are really weird and like to catch on EVERYTHING! So working with it it kept catching my shirt and branches and I’d have to pull it to get it free and it would mess up what I had pulled into the tree already. May just be how this stuff is but I don’t know because this is my first time using stuff like this so I figured I’d throw that warning out there.",

        "Christmas ornament hanging|||B09MFH83CC ★★★★★ [2023-12-04] <b>Pure Elegance</b> My quest for the perfect ribbon to elevate my Christmas ornaments led me to this Green Velvet Ribbon, and I must say, it exceeded all expectations. This 3/8-inch by 30 yards of sheer elegance transformed my ornaments and made them look ten times more expensive. Incredible Quality for Ornament Hanging: Stunning Appearance: The rich, deep green color of this ribbon added a layer of opulence to my ornaments. It has an innate luxuriousness that genuinely stands out, making each piece look like a carefully curated masterpiece. High-Quality Velvet Texture: The texture of the velvet is where this ribbon truly shines. The high-quality velvet feels soft and lush, and what's more, it avoids the overly shiny look that some ribbons tend to have. The subdued sheen enhances the overall elegance of the product. Non-Slip and Secure: One of the key highlights is the non-slip nature of this ribbon. Whether creating bows or simply hanging ornaments, the ribbon holds everything securely in place. No more slipping or sliding, just perfectly arranged bows that stay put. Versatility Beyond Ornaments: Suitable for Sewing Projects: The Green Velvet Ribbon is not limited to ornament hanging; it's a versatile ribbon that can be used for various sewing projects. The quality and texture make it an excellent choice for adding a touch of sophistication to your fabric creations.",

The texture is matte, not shiny, which I prefer. Each spool has 5 yards of ribbon for a total of 15 yards. The price seems a bit high for this type of ribbon and I’m sure it’s due to the wooden spools. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. Sometimes having reusable wooden spools is exactly why I’ve made a specific purchase. This ribbon can be used in a variety of ways. I’ll be using when wrapping Christmas gifts, for hanging ornaments on my Christmas tree, and for embellishing fall/winter clothes I’ll be sewing for my granddaughters. I’ll add pictures when I can. I recommend this item only if you plan to reuse the wooden spools once the ribbon has been used."

        "hanging ornaments on Christmas tree<<<opaque|||B0CBPG8CWC ★★★★★ [2023-11-04] <b>3 spools of Lovely dark green opaque 1” ribbon</b> Vine Customer Review of Free Product This set of 3 wooden spools of dark green opaque ribbon with frayed edges has a satiny feel on one side of the ribbon. The texture is matte, not shiny, which I prefer. Each spool has 5 yards of ribbon for a total of 15 yards. The price seems a bit high for this type of ribbon and I’m sure it’s due to the wooden spools. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. Sometimes having reusable wooden spools is exactly why I’ve made a specific purchase. This ribbon can be used in a variety of ways. I’ll be using when wrapping Christmas gifts, for hanging ornaments on my Christmas tree, and for embellishing fall/winter clothes I’ll be sewing for my granddaughters. I’ll add pictures when I can. I recommend this item only if you plan to reuse the wooden spools once the ribbon has been used."

The value is akin to big box craft store prices, unless you have a store coupon, which would make this a bit pricier. Overall, it's a fun assortment and is an excellent addition to my ribbon hoard.

And it is so versatile I can hardly wait to make bows to include on gifts, for children's hair, and even decorations. The Bow-dabra comes with an instruction book which is great but the creators went the extra mile and included a DVD to demonstrate just what you can do with it. VERY nice. The DVD is divided into sections so you can go right to the type of bow you want to make. Or, you can watch the entire thing all the way through which I did. You can make tiny bows for hair, decorative bows for packages, bows that include foil decorations, berries, flowers, or anything you can think of to include in the bow. They even demonstrate how to use up old scraps of ribbon to make a gorgeous bow. And these bows can get massive! You just have to see it after purchasing the Bow-dabra. I am planning a Bow-dabra party for my friends, to show them what all it will do. Summer is a great time to start thinking about Christmas decorations and gift wrapping so it would be fun to let each guest make a bow of their choosing. The guests can either bring their own ribbon and decorations or I could provide those. Either way, it's more fun if you do it yourself and have something to show. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that each bow you make uses a gold wire that is conveniently included in the Bow-dabra box. There is enough for about 10 bows. Do you can get the hang of it before buying more wire. The wire is only used to hold the bow together, so you could probably find some other colors. But I love the gold. It adds elegance to every bow. This is the cutest and most useful craft item I have seen in a long time. You just have to get one and try it for yourself. I LOVE this!"

I like to use ribbons for card making, and these have just the right width (3/8 inch) and are DOUBLE-SIDED. It really looks so much better when tying bows, if the ribbon is double-sided. It just doesn’t look tidy when the “bad side” of a one sided ribbon shows up after tying a bow. Other Positives: 1) The colors are vivid, there are 20 colors. Two of the colors are gold and silver. The gold and silver are shimmery and has a grosgrain look to it. 2) The ribbons have a smooth, satin finish to it. It is made of 100% polyester. Very easy to work with and making bows. The cut ends will fray. Sometimes I use a bit of glue on the ends to stop the fraying. 3) As soon as I saw all the colors, I thought of all the different cards I can make. Red ribbon for Valentine’s and Christmas, Orange and black for Halloween, blue for July 4th, etc. 4) Value priced, too at 48 cents a spool. There are 15 yards per roll for a total of 300 yards. This will last me a long time. These ribbons are great to have on hand for crafting, gift wrapping, or party events. I recommend them for value and quality."

Hersteller 20 m sein, nachgemessen habe ich aber nicht. Die Vorder- und Rückseite des Bandes sind etwas unterschiedlich glänzend und dieses Band sieht zu einer Schleife gebunden sehr edel aus. Ich werde es mir für besondere Geschenke zurücklegen. Ein kleiner Tipp von mir: Wenn man so ein schönes Band mehrfach verwenden möchte (für Weihnachtsdeko z.B.), dann kann man Knicke und Falten ganz einfach wegbügeln, wenn man das Bügeleisen auf ganz schwache Hitze stellt.

They will be wonderful for Christmas crafting and wrapping small gifts. These are very pretty soft fluffy ribbons. The red is a nice rich deep red. Green is a softer version of a color and not overly dark. What a treat to have them on wooden spools. I will probably use those in my crafting too when the ribbon is gone. There are 5 yards of each color ribbon on the spools. For my crafting this will go fairly far, but if you are wrapping large gifts or doing large projects just know the amount you need. These are perfect for holidays and would make a lovely gift. The whole set feels very special.",

They measure 3/8” wide and 5 yards in length which is plenty for my purposes. The colors are exactly as they appeared on my screen and they remind me of vintage ribbons I have found in my grandmother’s sewing box. I’ve used this ribbon to hang Christmas ornaments on my tree, to tie around Christmas gifts and create sweet bows, and also for some sewing projects where I’m using these ribbons to embellish some clothes I’m making for my granddaughters. I recommend if you are considering purchasing this ribbon to pay attention to the measurements of this ribbon so you won’t be shocked when receiving a 3/8” wide ribbon! 😊I definitely recommend these ribbons.",

The first is my fault: I really didn't do the math well when I ordered this, and I just didn't realize how short a length I would get off each color. Some of these colors are gorgeous, but others I know I'm unlikely to use again. That tends to mean the colors I don't like will pile up, if I try to re-purchase more of the ones I do like - and that will happen quickly, with only 1 yard of each color. I really, really hate the way these were packed. The product picture shows each color rolled separately, but that's not what you get. Instead, you get about a half-dozen large rolls, which contain multiple colors. Without unrolling each one, it's impossible to see what's there. Because of this before I could even use the ribbon, I spent an hour and a half unrolling the big rolls and making small, individual rolls with each color. After that, I can see and access them all easily. But honestly, I really had much better things to do with my time than repack 30 yards of ribbon. The quality isn't bad. I had hoped for thicker ribbon, as I planned to use these to make necklaces and I want them to last. A thicker pile to the ribbon would prevent it from wrinkling too easily, and would keep it from looking prematurely worn. Anything I make from these, I will have to charge a bit less for and warn customers that the necklace cord will eventually wear out. What I do like: many of these colors are stunning. It is nice to have a sampler to allow me to figure out what I need most. I really hope that they hold up better than I am expecting. Time will tell. If all you need is ribbons for trim, or to hang ornaments from, these are a good choice. I think, however, they for my purposes, I am going to have to keep looking for higher quality."

The cloth used is thin and easy to work with, whether used to wrap a gift or to brighten the house decor and other projects in creative ways."

In addition, it also includes a CD-ROM, membership on the website and a roll of metallic tie. Personally, I feel as though the CD-ROM format is very dated; in order to access the tutorial, there is an application that must run. This did not launch on my computer and I could not gain access to it despite many attempts. I also accessed the website and the PDF walkthroughs to best understand how to complete a bow with the assistance of this device. It was well explained in the written guides online, with step-by-step instructions and visuals. The idea behind this tool is useful, but more-so for individuals looking for a quick way to assemble their scraps into a reusable and presentable form. A lot of the styles in the provided examples are dated and much more appropriate for an older crowd. The number one feature I found was that this holds your material in place while you assemble and tie it all together. Otherwise, it is a very simplistic device with more of a purpose for those who may have difficulty with fine motor skills but want to design and complete decorative bows on their own."

The other is a ribbed, satiny texture. Because it isn't wide, it's easy to tie and wrap with, and it looks delicate and tasteful. I plan to use it to wrap presents, but I might also use some as ornament hangers and to decorate cards with. I can see using it to festoon a wreath with as well."

VALUE: If this ribbon was going to the trash with wrapping paper, $4.99 for 100 yards is a good value. I’m giving the supplier credit that there actually are 100 yards on the roll. Unfortunately I bought this ribbon to serve as page markers for a Bible rebind. So, this ribbon is just too cheap looking and flimsy for that use. Value for me is zero.

PACKAGING: Unlike ribbon sold at brick and mortar stores, this roll came rolled around a core and in a cellophane envelope, but with no chip board sides to prevent the entire roll from falling off the sides of the core and totally tangling. PRODUCT LISTENING: Sold as Dark Red Double Faced Color is subjective but this roll of Dk Red appears to this purchaser to be closer to Light Red Wine in color. With a decidedly different texture on the reverse side, it is highly doubtful that this can be considered “Double Faced”.

Cards scrapbooking adorning clothing, hats you name it this sky's the limit. I like how the 20 colors of 100 yards of ribbon come in a nice display package with little indentations to keep each roll. That's really neat. I did notice that a couple of my 🌈 rainbow colors had less on the roll than the other rolls had, so I don't know what's up with that but every inch counts. Today my mom and I decided to string some really nice pony beads I'm also testing onto a length of the lime green ribbon. To make sure that the beads would stay on for my mom we knotted one near the bottom of one end of the length that I kind of measured not with tape just kind of put it around my neck and figured out how big I'd want it for it to go over her neck easy. Since we both shake with essential tremor, I wanted to make it easier for her to string the thin ribbon into the big pony bead openings. So I wrapped some Scotch tape around the other end. I wish I could show you that first video I made for you guys. I had it too thick and somehow I also had it the tape on slow motion? So it's really weird but it would take too long to upload I'm sure. Also my mom was joking with me and pulling the tip of the ribbon away so I couldn't stick the little bead on. It was funny you had to be there I guess haha just imagine it. 😜 Anyway, I made the tape narrower and it finally worked perfectly for my mom to string the beads on. It gives her practice with patterning and remembering colors and just hand eye coordination and all those mental gymnastics we need to do to keep our aging brains sharp. Plus she loves jewelry so making her own is even better. It's great how this pack of ribbon gives you so many colors at once without you having to buy 10,000 yards of each. Made in China."

Its premium gloss finish, durability, and versatility make it a must-have for any gift wrapping, crafting, or decorating needs.",

It has the most popular Christmas elements, the red truck, snowman, Santa, snowflakes and the traditional red and black gingham. They mix and match just wonderfully! They are not thin by any means and really have a nice weight and quality. Not sheer at all. The prints are only on one side (except the red and black gingham, that is the same on both sides) and that is not a problem at all as most ribbon is that way, just wanted to mention that. Perfect for your farmhouse creations. Timeless prints too! The wire is nice and sturdy. Colors are vibrant. Perfect for the finishing touches on Christmas gifts, wreaths, centerpieces, scrapbooking and more! Your imagination is the limit."

I was hoping for a much more thicker approach. I should of researched the product better. This is thin and can be used for balloons or maybe an art project in a scrapbook or photo album, maybe a head piece for a holloween. This will not hold up as decorations or a banner (which is what I'm looking for). I'll use it as the string for our balloons and try and buy something else to edge the ceiling for the party. Technically it is as advertised. Just thin. I gave it 4 stars because if u use it for other ideas it will work great. Just not what I particularly was looking for."

Thus makes me sound like Lady Bountiful on Boxing Day, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. I’m a wage slave, too, I just feel better saying ‘thanks’ to the people who help out all year, especially in these crazy times, even if it means I need to skip drive-throughs and lattes-to-go for several weeks.
