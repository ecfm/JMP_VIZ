I wouldn't use it on clothing because it's lacking that extra something something, but for the price, you do get pretty decent ribbon here. I used it for decor at a recent class reunion. I attached photos to lengths of ribbon for a wall display, and I used some to tie around vases for the table centerpieces. It kept the decorating costs low yet still looked stunning. 5 Stars.",

I was expecting these ribbons to be of a certain length (22 yards PER roll) when I received them. These ribbons were purchased to be cut in certain lengths to be tied around trees & utility poles. FOUR of the ten rolls were not a consecutive 22 yards. They were cut & another piece taped on. It was like they ran out of ribbon so they added scrap ribbon to make up the difference. This caused my measure to be inaccurate for what I needed. Otherwise, the ribbon itself was a beautiful shade of pink, they were soft, the satin seemed like good quality but did gray easily."

I actually bought this to make big labels. My sewing machine has a couple of fonts on and I can write things with it. I wanted to make a black stripe on a hand towel that had my dad’s name, apt# and phone. I found that running the ribbon through the sewing machine gave it wavy edges. It still worked but it really wants to warp even as I was sewing. So the text is a bit diagonal on the ribbon. I am planning to use this for packages from now on. It’s lovely ribbon."

This is for Breast Cancer awareness, so it really needed to be pink. It's peach. It's not even close to pink. Since the front cardboard label was torn off (which is the part that has the name of the color of the ribbon), it makes me wonder if someone ran out of pink and just substituted this hoping it would work. If that's what happened, it doesn't work - at all. If that's not what happened, this is fraudulent marketing. This is not pink - not by a long shot. The picture is definitely pink, but this ribbon is definitely peach.

I chose the red ribbon and I've already started wrapping with it. Because of how thin the ribbon is, this would be better for smaller gifts if you'd like to wrap a ribbon around it. Or, you can also tie this to the handle of a bag to make it a little different. Larger gifts might require thicker or wider bows, and therefore this might not be appropriate by itself. It can work as a compliment to a bigger bow. I typically go for ribbons with wires just because they're a little easier to work with when you need the ribbon to conform to a specific angle or shape, but this wasn't difficult to use. The only thing that I would say is that if you typically tape or staple your ribbons sometimes to keep them in place, this isn't the ribbon that's going to cooperate well. Hot glue guns might be better to use when working with this ribbon to get it to form a particular shape or angle. Some examples of craft projects I'm currently working on are using these ribbons on small vases and wrapping of small items for jewelries and handmade bracelets. The feel of the ribbon felt okay. It didn't feel as soft as I expected but more like paper. I would still get this again but in different colors for other DIY projects I'm thinking about.",

No, it's not super thick or high quality, but it has a beautiful sheen and is sturdy enough for most applications. I wouldn't use it on clothing because it's lacking that extra something something, but for the price, you do get pretty decent ribbon here. I used it for decor at a recent class reunion. I attached photos to lengths of ribbon for a wall display, and I used some to tie around vases for the table centerpieces. It kept the decorating costs low yet still looked stunning. 5 Stars."

The texture is matte, not shiny, which I prefer. Each spool has 5 yards of ribbon for a total of 15 yards. The price seems a bit high for this type of ribbon and I’m sure it’s due to the wooden spools. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. Sometimes having reusable wooden spools is exactly why I’ve made a specific purchase. This ribbon can be used in a variety of ways. I’ll be using when wrapping Christmas gifts, for hanging ornaments on my Christmas tree, and for embellishing fall/winter clothes I’ll be sewing for my granddaughters. I’ll add pictures when I can. I recommend this item only if you plan to reuse the wooden spools once the ribbon has been used."

        "Designing and completing decorative bows for those with fine motor skill difficulties<<<Holds project in place|||B0C24XWHW4 ★★★★☆ <b>Simple Tool to Simplify Bow Making</b> This Bowdabra Hairbow Making hit is a great tool for holding your project in place for consistent and tightly crafted bows each time. It best assists when working with multiple materials and/or layers but is easiest to learn on single layered bows. This device would be most useful as a gift for individuals who experience pain, fatigue, or difficulty with fine motor movements. This set arrives with the main gadget, a ruler that slots on top and then a piece to evenly scrunch down your DIY bow. In addition, it also includes a CD-ROM, membership on the website and a roll of metallic tie. Personally, I feel as though the CD-ROM format is very dated; in order to access the tutorial, there is an application that must run. This did not launch on my computer and I could not gain access to it despite many attempts. I also accessed the website and the PDF walkthroughs to best understand how to complete a bow with the assistance of this device. It was well explained in the written guides online, with step-by-step instructions and visuals. The idea behind this tool is useful, but more-so for individuals looking for a quick way to assemble their scraps into a reusable and presentable form. A lot of the styles in the provided examples are dated and much more appropriate for an older crowd. The number one feature I found was that this holds your material in place while you assemble and tie it all together. Otherwise, it is a very simplistic device with more of a purpose for those who may have difficulty with fine motor skills but want to design and complete decorative bows on their own."

Ordered 2 varieties for 2 different companies. Although feel like same company but different sellers. On page looks like burlap-type fabric so was going to use on tree. In person, it's a cheesecloth/gauze type fabric. What gives it legs is the quality of the dye. The color, especially on the darker blue, is even with True to color hue. This set in Sky Blue, Navy & White is my fave to use on magnetic gift boxes. Most boxes have a gloss finish & the gauze in contrast looks simply tasteful. Plus the lightweight lets you layer colors to give more depth to the eye. You will need 3 hands to tie it on a glossy surface but the end result shines. The other set was in Burgundy, Pink & White but didn't figure out layering til the blue. No I am not redoing bows but this set has grown on me so give it a chance.

Ordered 2 varieties for 2 different companies. Although feel like same company but different sellers. On page looks like burlap-type fabric so was going to use on tree. In person, it's a cheesecloth/gauze type fabric. What gives it legs is the quality of the dye. The color, especially on the darker blue, is even with True to color hue. This set in Sky Blue, Navy & White is my fave to use on magnetic gift boxes. Most boxes have a gloss finish & the gauze in contrast looks simply tasteful. Plus the lightweight lets you layer colors to give more depth to the eye. You will need 3 hands to tie it on a glossy surface but the end result shines. The other set was in Burgundy, Pink & White but didn't figure out layering til the blue. No I am not redoing bows but this set has grown on me so give it a chance.

One side is clearly shiny, the other is more matte. The fraying is natural, but tidy. My favorite part of this set, though, is the inclusion of the spools!! I’ve been hoping to add spools to my detail kit… and here they are! They are also the perfect size. Enough to add pop and interest to a picture, but not so large or bulky to take away from the actual bridal details themselves. My only wish would be to have the option to mix and match colors. Since this ribbon is not for a specific craft or one-use project in my case, I would prefer a choice of colors rather than 3 spools of the same color. But, I’d still buy another Vitalizart set. The gray/silver is beautiful, and the price for their spooled ribbon is very affordable."

I like to use ribbons for card making, and these have just the right width (3/8 inch) and are DOUBLE-SIDED. It really looks so much better when tying bows, if the ribbon is double-sided. It just doesn’t look tidy when the “bad side” of a one sided ribbon shows up after tying a bow. Other Positives: 1) The colors are vivid, there are 20 colors. Two of the colors are gold and silver. The gold and silver are shimmery and has a grosgrain look to it. 2) The ribbons have a smooth, satin finish to it. It is made of 100% polyester. Very easy to work with and making bows. The cut ends will fray. Sometimes I use a bit of glue on the ends to stop the fraying. 3) As soon as I saw all the colors, I thought of all the different cards I can make. Red ribbon for Valentine’s and Christmas, Orange and black for Halloween, blue for July 4th, etc. 4) Value priced, too at 48 cents a spool. There are 15 yards per roll for a total of 300 yards. This will last me a long time. These ribbons are great to have on hand for crafting, gift wrapping, or party events. I recommend them for value and quality."

This was the only wide ribbon I could find online in the UK.

Of course, you can use them singly as well. These are good enough quality that they can be used for packages but also for more decor related crafts. Adorning a tree, dressing up a swag, a design element of porch pots, using them as part of a tablescape in your dining room for a dinner party, all of these would be great places to utilize these ribbons.

        "Design element of porch pots|||B0CB5M64Q7 ★★★★☆ <b>Nice variety</b> My sister is a little obsessed with the Grinch and when I saw this pack of ribbons I knew that her gifts had to be adorned with them. This is a nice set of spools of ribbon with six different Grinch-y designs. Each spool has five yards of wired ribbon. Two of the ribbons are glitter based and the other four are plain. The ribbons are of good quality and the designs are clear and crisp. The variety is great as you can match the more obvious Grinch themes with the more neutral. Of course, you can use them singly as well. These are good enough quality that they can be used for packages but also for more decor related crafts. Adorning a tree, dressing up a swag, a design element of porch pots, using them as part of a tablescape in your dining room for a dinner party, all of these would be great places to utilize these ribbons. If you use them indoors and are careful about how you pack them away I think you could even get multiple seasons worth of use from them. At less than $3 per roll they seem reasonably priced."

Technically it is as advertised. Just thin. I gave it 4 stars because if u use it for other ideas it will work great. Just not what I particularly was looking for."

Since it's going to be a one time use I didn't want to spend the time to hand stich or pull out and set up my sewing machine to attach it to the vest I'm putting it on. I bought a clear fabric glue that does dry clear. When I used the glue to attach it to the vest I can see everywhere the glue is between the ribbon and vest. So if your planning on using any type of glue pass on this ribbon. The ribbon also frays very easily so I had to glue each end under to get a clean line.

        "Sewing into a dress|||B08P9NPY3P ★★☆☆☆ <b>EXTREMELY THIN AND NOT DOUBLE FACED</b> As the old adage goes, “You get what you pay for”, KINDA? VALUE: If this ribbon was going to the trash with wrapping paper, $4.99 for 100 yards is a good value. I’m giving the supplier credit that there actually are 100 yards on the roll. Unfortunately I bought this ribbon to serve as page markers for a Bible rebind. So, this ribbon is just too cheap looking and flimsy for that use. Value for me is zero. QUALITY: mediocre to poor, extremely thin material with almost invisible edge detail. PACKAGING: Unlike ribbon sold at brick and mortar stores, this roll came rolled around a core and in a cellophane envelope, but with no chip board sides to prevent the entire roll from falling off the sides of the core and totally tangling. PRODUCT LISTENING: Sold as Dark Red Double Faced Color is subjective but this roll of Dk Red appears to this purchaser to be closer to Light Red Wine in color. With a decidedly different texture on the reverse side, it is highly doubtful that this can be considered “Double Faced”. SUMMARY: If you are looking for ribbon for decoration, say for hair ribbons or seasonal decor, or for more permanent items like sewing into a dress or to make book markers, look elsewhere. If you only want to tie up a quick gift, or need wine colored string, go for it."

The ribbons are of good quality and the designs are clear and crisp. The variety is great as you can match the more obvious Grinch themes with the more neutral. Of course, you can use them singly as well. These are good enough quality that they can be used for packages but also for more decor related crafts. Adorning a tree, dressing up a swag, a design element of porch pots, using them as part of a tablescape in your dining room for a dinner party, all of these would be great places to utilize these ribbons.

It was funny you had to be there I guess haha just imagine it. 😜 Anyway, I made the tape narrower and it finally worked perfectly for my mom to string the beads on. It gives her practice with patterning and remembering colors and just hand eye coordination and all those mental gymnastics we need to do to keep our aging brains sharp. Plus she loves jewelry so making her own is even better. It's great how this pack of ribbon gives you so many colors at once without you having to buy 10,000 yards of each. Made in China."

The first time I adhered it to the shoes I used the adhesive from the trim. Considering the wear and tear they took they did pretty good. I did however, use some stronger glue to reattach the trim so I cold be sure it would be a little more sturdy.

They measure 3/8” wide and 5 yards in length which is plenty for my purposes. The colors are exactly as they appeared on my screen and they remind me of vintage ribbons I have found in my grandmother’s sewing box. I’ve used this ribbon to hang Christmas ornaments on my tree, to tie around Christmas gifts and create sweet bows, and also for some sewing projects where I’m using these ribbons to embellish some clothes I’m making for my granddaughters. I recommend if you are considering purchasing this ribbon to pay attention to the measurements of this ribbon so you won’t be shocked when receiving a 3/8” wide ribbon! 😊I definitely recommend these ribbons."

Das Band hat eine Breite von 10cm und ist aus Satin gefertigt. Es ist sehr hochwertig und fühlt sich weich und geschmeidig an. Ich war begeistert von der leuchtend roten Farbe des Bandes, die perfekt für eine feierliche Veranstaltung geeignet ist. Das Band hat sich leicht zu einer Schleife binden lassen und hielt die Form sehr gut. Das Band wurde auch sehr schnell geliefert und war gut verpackt. Insgesamt bin ich sehr zufrieden mit dem FAKILO Geschenkband und würde es auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen. Es ist eine tolle Option für alle, die nach einem hochwertigen und auffälligen Band für besondere Anlässe suchen. Ich würde dem Produkt 5 von 5 Sternen geben."

It doesn’t look like you could really sew it on to anything like clothing, but a good double-faced tape will let you use it to trim cards and other crafts. It’s very soft and Christmasy looking – not red but a deeper elegant touch to your crafts. I would say that it may be more expensive than what I would typically pay for something similar. If I found it on sale or for a much cheaper price, I would be more apt to purchase it again in the future."

I like to use ribbons for card making, and these have just the right width (3/8 inch) and are DOUBLE-SIDED. It really looks so much better when tying bows, if the ribbon is double-sided. It just doesn’t look tidy when the “bad side” of a one sided ribbon shows up after tying a bow. Other Positives: 1) The colors are vivid, there are 20 colors. Two of the colors are gold and silver. The gold and silver are shimmery and has a grosgrain look to it. 2) The ribbons have a smooth, satin finish to it. It is made of 100% polyester. Very easy to work with and making bows. The cut ends will fray. Sometimes I use a bit of glue on the ends to stop the fraying. 3) As soon as I saw all the colors, I thought of all the different cards I can make. Red ribbon for Valentine’s and Christmas, Orange and black for Halloween, blue for July 4th, etc. 4) Value priced, too at 48 cents a spool. There are 15 yards per roll for a total of 300 yards.

Cards scrapbooking adorning clothing, hats you name it this sky's the limit. I like how the 20 colors of 100 yards of ribbon come in a nice display package with little indentations to keep each roll. That's really neat. I did notice that a couple of my 🌈 rainbow colors had less on the roll than the other rolls had, so I don't know what's up with that but every inch counts. Today my mom and I decided to string some really nice pony beads I'm also testing onto a length of the lime green ribbon. To make sure that the beads would stay on for my mom we knotted one near the bottom of one end of the length that I kind of measured not with tape just kind of put it around my neck and figured out how big I'd want it for it to go over her neck easy. Since we both shake with essential tremor, I wanted to make it easier for her to string the thin ribbon into the big pony bead openings. So I wrapped some Scotch tape around the other end. I wish I could show you that first video I made for you guys. I had it too thick and somehow I also had it the tape on slow motion? So it's really weird but it would take too long to upload I'm sure. Also my mom was joking with me and pulling the tip of the ribbon away so I couldn't stick the little bead on. It was funny you had to be there I guess haha just imagine it. 😜 Anyway, I made the tape narrower and it finally worked perfectly for my mom to string the beads on. It gives her practice with patterning and remembering colors and just hand eye coordination and all those mental gymnastics we need to do to keep our aging brains sharp. Plus she loves jewelry so making her own is even better. It's great how this pack of ribbon gives you so many colors at once without you having to buy 10,000 yards of each. Made in China."

With 25 yards on the role it is unlikely that I will ever use at all so I have shared with some of my crafty friends. I think this would also make a great trim to a child’s dress or a garment. This would be perfect for any holiday ornaments that you’re making or samplers. The price cannot be beat, and I would purchase this again in a heartbeat."

        "card making<<<3/8 inch width|||B09XM6ZN1Q ★★★★★ <b>Very Pretty Ribbons in Lots of Colors</b> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these 20 ribbons of 20 different colors. I like to use ribbons for card making, and these have just the right width (3/8 inch) and are DOUBLE-SIDED. It really looks so much better when tying bows, if the ribbon is double-sided. It just doesn’t look tidy when the “bad side” of a one sided ribbon shows up after tying a bow. Other Positives: 1) The colors are vivid, there are 20 colors. Two of the colors are gold and silver. The gold and silver are shimmery and has a grosgrain look to it. 2) The ribbons have a smooth, satin finish to it. It is made of 100% polyester. Very easy to work with and making bows. The cut ends will fray. Sometimes I use a bit of glue on the ends to stop the fraying. 3) As soon as I saw all the colors, I thought of all the different cards I can make. Red ribbon for Valentine’s and Christmas, Orange and black for Halloween, blue for July 4th, etc. 4) Value priced, too at 48 cents a spool. There are 15 yards per roll for a total of 300 yards. This will last me a long time. These ribbons are great to have on hand for crafting, gift wrapping, or party events. I recommend them for value and quality.",

        "Decorating gift bags<<<Thin ribbon|||B08M5QMQLP ★★★★☆ <b>Great for Crafts Ideas!</b> Bottomline: This ribbon is a great addition to the current craft projects I have going on. Especially with Mother's Day around the corner, there's an endless amount of possibilities of what you can do with this ribbon to turn something simple and customize it with your own style. I chose the red ribbon and I've already started wrapping with it. Because of how thin the ribbon is, this would be better for smaller gifts if you'd like to wrap a ribbon around it. Or, you can also tie this to the handle of a bag to make it a little different. Larger gifts might require thicker or wider bows, and therefore this might not be appropriate by itself. It can work as a compliment to a bigger bow. I typically go for ribbons with wires just because they're a little easier to work with when you need the ribbon to conform to a specific angle or shape, but this wasn't difficult to use. The only thing that I would say is that if you typically tape or staple your ribbons sometimes to keep them in place, this isn't the ribbon that's going to cooperate well. Hot glue guns might be better to use when working with this ribbon to get it to form a particular shape or angle. Some examples of craft projects I'm currently working on are using these ribbons on small vases and wrapping of small items for jewelries and handmade bracelets. The feel of the ribbon felt okay. It didn't feel as soft as I expected but more like paper. I would still get this again but in different colors for other DIY projects I'm thinking about."

The ribbon width looks lovely on packages and the length of each piece is sufficient for a single box. I was a little bit surprised to discover that these do not come on spools like I'd expected. Some come all squished together in a bag, and others are tied and put in a bag. It's not a huge deal, since I just hung them on a doorknob for a few days to get any wrinkles out and they were fine (you can iron them too). It's also nice that it cuts down on waste and I don't have to throw out all those cardboard cores. Overall, this is very nice quality ribbon and you get a sufficient quantity of each pattern to use for gift wrapping and I certainly recommend it."

I've taken to just wrapping blankets, sweaters, etc. in a ribbon for the presentation. This ribbon is quite beautiful. I choose a sage green, so that it's neutral on any gift. It's very delicate and the frayed edges look so pretty on packages. The ribbon is about 1.5 inches wide and 5 yards long per spool. (You get 4 spools in the package.) This means I can wrap quite a few packages in this ribbon. at 1.5 inches, I tend to use this for smaller packages, with thinner yarn. it's more of a summer wrap. Because the chiffon is thin, this is very gauzy, so be aware that it's not a robust, satiny ribbon. It's very very delicate. I like it a lot."

        "Making professional-looking bows|||B0C24XWHW4 ★★★★★ <b>Your ribbon collection just tripled… Easy to use and huge time saver.</b> Bowdabra is such a game changer for making all kinds of professional looking bows. I don’t need to pin it down while I’m making folds with my toes anymore! And can make a bow using two or three different kinds of ribbon with ease. I didn’t watch the included DVD yet, as I’ve seen these used on YouTube and it’s sort of easy to figure out -but I’d suggest watching it anyway. I could be doing it wrong:). First you put a chenille wire (or any type you prefer) into the groove. This contraption basically just pinches the ribbon while you make the folds. Then after you work your magic, just pull it out by your wire and twist. This is SO much faster than by hand, it is totally worth it. I designed a second holiday wreath just so I could use this more and will be making up reasons to give gifts to wrap all year. If you enjoy giftwrapping or crafting with bows, I very much recommend the Bow-Dabra.",

They measure 3/8” wide and 5 yards in length which is plenty for my purposes. The colors are exactly as they appeared on my screen and they remind me of vintage ribbons I have found in my grandmother’s sewing box. I’ve used this ribbon to hang Christmas ornaments on my tree, to tie around Christmas gifts and create sweet bows, and also for some sewing projects where I’m using these ribbons to embellish some clothes I’m making for my granddaughters. I recommend if you are considering purchasing this ribbon to pay attention to the measurements of this ribbon so you won’t be shocked when receiving a 3/8” wide ribbon! 😊I definitely recommend these ribbons."

It conforms to any shape you need with creasing or bending or flattening. I use it to make teeny tiny bows to put at the top of my toy poodles ears when grooming her (I make the bows on a hemostat with a tiny rubber band then slide it from the hemostat onto a few twisted strands of my pup's fur) and it's perfect for that but I also look forward to making some ornaments this year with bows and loops at the top made from this ribbon.

I do think it is probably limited to one use, just given the fragility of the fabric, but for the cost I don’t think that’s unreasonable. This would also be great to make centerpieces for a party, shower, wedding, etc. paired with flowers or candle holders.",

And it is so versatile I can hardly wait to make bows to include on gifts, for children's hair, and even decorations. The Bow-dabra comes with an instruction book which is great but the creators went the extra mile and included a DVD to demonstrate just what you can do with it. VERY nice. The DVD is divided into sections so you can go right to the type of bow you want to make. Or, you can watch the entire thing all the way through which I did. You can make tiny bows for hair, decorative bows for packages, bows that include foil decorations, berries, flowers, or anything you can think of to include in the bow. They even demonstrate how to use up old scraps of ribbon to make a gorgeous bow. And these bows can get massive! You just have to see it after purchasing the Bow-dabra. I am planning a Bow-dabra party for my friends, to show them what all it will do. Summer is a great time to start thinking about Christmas decorations and gift wrapping so it would be fun to let each guest make a bow of their choosing. The guests can either bring their own ribbon and decorations or I could provide those. Either way, it's more fun if you do it yourself and have something to show. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that each bow you make uses a gold wire that is conveniently included in the Bow-dabra box. There is enough for about 10 bows. Do you can get the hang of it before buying more wire. The wire is only used to hold the bow together, so you could probably find some other colors. But I love the gold. It adds elegance to every bow. This is the cutest and most useful craft item I have seen in a long time. You just have to get one and try it for yourself. I LOVE this!"

Unfortunately I bought this ribbon to serve as page markers for a Bible rebind. So, this ribbon is just too cheap looking and flimsy for that use. Value for me is zero. QUALITY: mediocre to poor, extremely thin material with almost invisible edge detail. PACKAGING: Unlike ribbon sold at brick and mortar stores, this roll came rolled around a core and in a cellophane envelope, but with no chip board sides to prevent the entire roll from falling off the sides of the core and totally tangling. PRODUCT LISTENING: Sold as Dark Red Double Faced Color is subjective but this roll of Dk Red appears to this purchaser to be closer to Light Red Wine in color. With a decidedly different texture on the reverse side, it is highly doubtful that this can be considered “Double Faced”. SUMMARY: If you are looking for ribbon for decoration, say for hair ribbons or seasonal decor, or for more permanent items like sewing into a dress or to make book markers, look elsewhere. If you only want to tie up a quick gift, or need wine colored string, go for it."

Cards scrapbooking adorning clothing, hats you name it this sky's the limit. I like how the 20 colors of 100 yards of ribbon come in a nice display package with little indentations to keep each roll. That's really neat. I did notice that a couple of my 🌈 rainbow colors had less on the roll than the other rolls had, so I don't know what's up with that but every inch counts. Today my mom and I decided to string some really nice pony beads I'm also testing onto a length of the lime green ribbon. To make sure that the beads would stay on for my mom we knotted one near the bottom of one end of the length that I kind of measured not with tape just kind of put it around my neck and figured out how big I'd want it for it to go over her neck easy. Since we both shake with essential tremor, I wanted to make it easier for her to string the thin ribbon into the big pony bead openings. So I wrapped some Scotch tape around the other end. I wish I could show you that first video I made for you guys. I had it too thick and somehow I also had it the tape on slow motion? So it's really weird but it would take too long to upload I'm sure. Also my mom was joking with me and pulling the tip of the ribbon away so I couldn't stick the little bead on. It was funny you had to be there I guess haha just imagine it. 😜 Anyway, I made the tape narrower and it finally worked perfectly for my mom to string the beads on. It gives her practice with patterning and remembering colors and just hand eye coordination and all those mental gymnastics we need to do to keep our aging brains sharp.

        "making necklaces<<<thin ribbon|||B09MBZC8Q8 ★★★☆☆ <b>Nice, with a couple of issues.</b> This ribbon looks nice enough if you just need something to use to hang thinga with, but I was disappointed for several reasons. The first is my fault: I really didn't do the math well when I ordered this, and I just didn't realize how short a length I would get off each color. Some of these colors are gorgeous, but others I know I'm unlikely to use again. That tends to mean the colors I don't like will pile up, if I try to re-purchase more of the ones I do like - and that will happen quickly, with only 1 yard of each color. I really, really hate the way these were packed. The product picture shows each color rolled separately, but that's not what you get. Instead, you get about a half-dozen large rolls, which contain multiple colors. Without unrolling each one, it's impossible to see what's there. Because of this before I could even use the ribbon, I spent an hour and a half unrolling the big rolls and making small, individual rolls with each color. After that, I can see and access them all easily. But honestly, I really had much better things to do with my time than repack 30 yards of ribbon. The quality isn't bad. I had hoped for thicker ribbon, as I planned to use these to make necklaces and I want them to last. A thicker pile to the ribbon would prevent it from wrinkling too easily, and would keep it from looking prematurely worn. Anything I make from these, I will have to charge a bit less for and warn customers that the necklace cord will eventually wear out. What I do like: many of these colors are stunning. It is nice to have a sampler to allow me to figure out what I need most. I really hope that they hold up better than I am expecting. Time will tell. If all you need is ribbons for trim, or to hang ornaments from, these are a good choice. I think, however, they for my purposes, I am going to have to keep looking for higher quality."

I had looked at the wrong place on the spool and thought the iron had only temporarily made a color change with the heat but in fact I found the place where I hit it with an iron and the dye is indeed gone.

It's the trend where you wrap your front door to look like a present (1 band horizonatally, 1 band vertically and then put a bow at the intersection). Pretty easy to do and this material was perfect for the harsh outside weather. It has a velvety feel which makes it look expensive. After 2.5 months outside, it didn't lose even a bit of its color, and I kept the ribbon to reattempt the next year as well. For my standard-sized door, 1 of these was enough, although I only wrapped the front side to save on the material. Hope this helps :)"

I am able to use this with my sewing machine, and while it was really difficult to fold and iron flat- it doesn't hold a crease very well and I couldn't get it to fold straight- it held up fabulously under my sewing machine. The satin is soft and pliable, not plastic feeling, and it didn't melt from the iron, even on the hottest setting. I'm using it as a hem for a rainbow petticoat, so I won't be washing it, but I think it would be okay to send through the washer and dryer, since it didn't melt from the iron.

        "trim|||B09MBZC8Q8 ★★★☆☆ <b>Nice, with a couple of issues.</b> This ribbon looks nice enough if you just need something to use to hang thinga with, but I was disappointed for several reasons. The first is my fault: I really didn't do the math well when I ordered this, and I just didn't realize how short a length I would get off each color. Some of these colors are gorgeous, but others I know I'm unlikely to use again. That tends to mean the colors I don't like will pile up, if I try to re-purchase more of the ones I do like - and that will happen quickly, with only 1 yard of each color. I really, really hate the way these were packed. The product picture shows each color rolled separately, but that's not what you get. Instead, you get about a half-dozen large rolls, which contain multiple colors. Without unrolling each one, it's impossible to see what's there. Because of this before I could even use the ribbon, I spent an hour and a half unrolling the big rolls and making small, individual rolls with each color. After that, I can see and access them all easily. But honestly, I really had much better things to do with my time than repack 30 yards of ribbon. The quality isn't bad. I had hoped for thicker ribbon, as I planned to use these to make necklaces and I want them to last. A thicker pile to the ribbon would prevent it from wrinkling too easily, and would keep it from looking prematurely worn. Anything I make from these, I will have to charge a bit less for and warn customers that the necklace cord will eventually wear out. What I do like: many of these colors are stunning. It is nice to have a sampler to allow me to figure out what I need most. I really hope that they hold up better than I am expecting. Time will tell. If all you need is ribbons for trim, or to hang ornaments from, these are a good choice. I think, however, they for my purposes, I am going to have to keep looking for higher quality.",
        "Sewing and crafting|||B09XM6ZN1Q ★★★★★ <b>Nice color assortment</b> I ordered this assortment of 20 spools of double-faced satin ribbon because I do historical costuming as a hobby and thought this might be useful to decorate various projects. Only one color (a bright pink I'm unlikely ever to use) was a duplicate, so I think this set will be very handy going forward. It isn't the best quality, nor is it the worst, and it could easily be used to embellish clothing, doll clothes, hair decorations, a variety of crafts, scrapbooking, etc. I think it's a good value for the quantity.",

Instead it was all wadded up in a cheap plastic bag (see photo). I thought, “Did I really order this?” When I went back to check, sure enough, the description said, “10 Yards Velvet Ribbon Spool...” It’s pretty, and is the color I wanted, a light turquoise. The quality seems just OK, nothing special. I got it for use on hand-sewed upcycled clothing projects, so time will tell, as will the number of washings. Maybe if the presentation was a little closer to the description, meaning, had it actually arrived on a spool, the initial perceived quality might be a tad higher. The lack of spool was so annoying that I was almost ready to return it. Then I discovered that the piece was actually 10 yards and 18 inches. So maybe they were aware of the spool thing and duked me some extra, which I appreciate. And the price was certainly in the right ballpark, so I’m keeping it."

I have had a bit of an issue with the edges of the ribbon shredding out and losing fibers as I work with it. Other than that, it's a nice ribbon, it's attractive and it's a good width for trimming my projects."

The downside is the same with any velvet ribbon -- it's inherently challenging to work with for tying bows. That is true with every velvet ribbon I've ever had, so I do not consider that a flaw in the product. That's just the nature of velvet. If you've never worked with velvet ribbon before, just know that part going in. I am not using this ribbon for sewing, but having handled it and examined it, I do think that it would be appropriate for a sewing project. The material is on the heavier side, it doesn't have a wired edge, and it doesn't seem to fray too badly. If you plan to use a straight cut end, you might need to add a little fray-stop liquid to keep the end nice and straight. But again, that's true with any velvet ribbon."

The satin is soft and pliable, not plastic feeling, and it didn't melt from the iron, even on the hottest setting.

The texture is matte, not shiny, which I prefer. Each spool has 5 yards of ribbon for a total of 15 yards. The price seems a bit high for this type of ribbon and I’m sure it’s due to the wooden spools. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. Sometimes having reusable wooden spools is exactly why I’ve made a specific purchase. This ribbon can be used in a variety of ways. I’ll be using when wrapping Christmas gifts, for hanging ornaments on my Christmas tree, and for embellishing fall/winter clothes I’ll be sewing for my granddaughters. I’ll add pictures when I can. I recommend this item only if you plan to reuse the wooden spools once the ribbon has been used."

The material isn't the greatest and has some sheerness to it, but when they're all tied up, they look fantastic and full. Two of the rolls have glitter accents, the others do not. The glitter does tend to shed, as glitter does, so be aware of that. The rolls are short and probably not enough in one roll to wrap a gift properly.

I needed something to kind of fill in gaps and make my candy/sweets/candyland tree look more full and this worked perfectly. I had enough with one and a little bit of another to do my 6 foot tree in 3 full length sections and 3 half length sections. The only downside to this stuff is the edges are really weird and like to catch on EVERYTHING! So working with it it kept catching my shirt and branches and I’d have to pull it to get it free and it would mess up what I had pulled into the tree already. May just be how this stuff is but I don’t know because this is my first time using stuff like this so I figured I’d throw that warning out there.",

No more slipping or sliding, just perfectly arranged bows that stay put.

So, what you see is the full 30 Ft of product. If you plan to wrap it around the entire tree, I'd recommend at least 2 rolls, 3 if you have a bigger tree.",

        "placing around or downwards on a tree|||B09XQ95YBT ★★★★★ <b>Beautiful colors! some are a light navy and the others a royal blue</b> Love these colorful wired ribbons, the blues are awesome and the silver sparkles. There are no end shredding or stray threads. I personally like wired ribbons because it stays in the shape you want it to, especially bows. I will use this mostly for gift wrapping as I have a lot of blue Christmas wrappings from a clearance purchase 2 years ago. Do not limit this ribbon to wrappings, it's perfect for decor bows, add to garland, a ribbon that goes around a tree or placed downwards. To get a nice curl roll the ribbon from the bottom up and once in position unroll it. Great ribbon",

The other is a ribbed, satiny texture. Because it isn't wide, it's easy to tie and wrap with, and it looks delicate and tasteful.

        "hanging ornaments|||B09MBZC8Q8 ★★★☆☆ <b>Nice, with a couple of issues.</b> This ribbon looks nice enough if you just need something to use to hang thinga with, but I was disappointed for several reasons. The first is my fault: I really didn't do the math well when I ordered this, and I just didn't realize how short a length I would get off each color. Some of these colors are gorgeous, but others I know I'm unlikely to use again. That tends to mean the colors I don't like will pile up, if I try to re-purchase more of the ones I do like - and that will happen quickly, with only 1 yard of each color. I really, really hate the way these were packed. The product picture shows each color rolled separately, but that's not what you get. Instead, you get about a half-dozen large rolls, which contain multiple colors. Without unrolling each one, it's impossible to see what's there. Because of this before I could even use the ribbon, I spent an hour and a half unrolling the big rolls and making small, individual rolls with each color. After that, I can see and access them all easily. But honestly, I really had much better things to do with my time than repack 30 yards of ribbon. The quality isn't bad. I had hoped for thicker ribbon, as I planned to use these to make necklaces and I want them to last. A thicker pile to the ribbon would prevent it from wrinkling too easily, and would keep it from looking prematurely worn. Anything I make from these, I will have to charge a bit less for and warn customers that the necklace cord will eventually wear out. What I do like: many of these colors are stunning. It is nice to have a sampler to allow me to figure out what I need most. I really hope that they hold up better than I am expecting. Time will tell. If all you need is ribbons for trim, or to hang ornaments from, these are a good choice. I think, however, they for my purposes, I am going to have to keep looking for higher quality.",

        "Adorning a tree|||B0CB5M64Q7 ★★★★☆ <b>Nice variety</b> My sister is a little obsessed with the Grinch and when I saw this pack of ribbons I knew that her gifts had to be adorned with them. This is a nice set of spools of ribbon with six different Grinch-y designs. Each spool has five yards of wired ribbon. Two of the ribbons are glitter based and the other four are plain. The ribbons are of good quality and the designs are clear and crisp. The variety is great as you can match the more obvious Grinch themes with the more neutral. Of course, you can use them singly as well. These are good enough quality that they can be used for packages but also for more decor related crafts. Adorning a tree, dressing up a swag, a design element of porch pots, using them as part of a tablescape in your dining room for a dinner party, all of these would be great places to utilize these ribbons. If you use them indoors and are careful about how you pack them away I think you could even get multiple seasons worth of use from them. At less than $3 per roll they seem reasonably priced.",

The texture is matte, not shiny, which I prefer. Each spool has 5 yards of ribbon for a total of 15 yards. The price seems a bit high for this type of ribbon and I’m sure it’s due to the wooden spools. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. Sometimes having reusable wooden spools is exactly why I’ve made a specific purchase. This ribbon can be used in a variety of ways. I’ll be using when wrapping Christmas gifts, for hanging ornaments on my Christmas tree, and for embellishing fall/winter clothes I’ll be sewing for my granddaughters. I’ll add pictures when I can. I recommend this item only if you plan to reuse the wooden spools once the ribbon has been used."

But, the quality of ribbon isn’t great. Especially with the opaque white and gold ribbon, it feels and sounds like crinkly paper. The gold color in the white one, as well as the gold color in the gold patterned spools, is like a yellow gold. Tacky color gold I believe.

The ribbon sheds a fair amount of glitter and gets everywhere a bit so be mindful of that, but the ribbon is still sparkly on the tree. I used two strands from two rolls to go around my 7ft tree which is approx 130cm wide. I used two strands so that I would have the desired gap between layers at my desired angle all the way around the tree. It looks lovely and much nicer than tinsel. This was the only wide ribbon I could find online in the UK. The last photo is to show how much ribbon was used to achieve the look I did, the roll on the left is unopened, and the other two rolls are the rolls I took my two strands from (I didn’t use strands from the same roll incase the roll ran out mid second-strand) I recommend the product."

Sometimes having reusable wooden spools is exactly why I’ve made a specific purchase. This ribbon can be used in a variety of ways. I’ll be using when wrapping Christmas gifts, for hanging ornaments on my Christmas tree, and for embellishing fall/winter clothes I’ll be sewing for my granddaughters. I’ll add pictures when I can.

They measure 3/8” wide and 5 yards in length which is plenty for my purposes. The colors are exactly as they appeared on my screen and they remind me of vintage ribbons I have found in my grandmother’s sewing box. I’ve used this ribbon to hang Christmas ornaments on my tree, to tie around Christmas gifts and create sweet bows, and also for some sewing projects where I’m using these ribbons to embellish some clothes I’m making for my granddaughters. I recommend if you are considering purchasing this ribbon to pay attention to the measurements of this ribbon so you won’t be shocked when receiving a 3/8” wide ribbon! 😊I definitely recommend these ribbons."

Ich werde es mir für besondere Geschenke zurücklegen. Ein kleiner Tipp von mir: Wenn man so ein schönes Band mehrfach verwenden möchte (für Weihnachtsdeko z.B.), dann kann man Knicke und Falten ganz einfach wegbügeln, wenn man das Bügeleisen auf ganz schwache Hitze stellt.

They measure 3/8” wide and 5 yards in length which is plenty for my purposes. The colors are exactly as they appeared on my screen and they remind me of vintage ribbons I have found in my grandmother’s sewing box. I’ve used this ribbon to hang Christmas ornaments on my tree, to tie around Christmas gifts and create sweet bows, and also for some sewing projects where I’m using these ribbons to embellish some clothes I’m making for my granddaughters.

And it is so versatile I can hardly wait to make bows to include on gifts, for children's hair, and even decorations. The Bow-dabra comes with an instruction book which is great but the creators went the extra mile and included a DVD to demonstrate just what you can do with it. VERY nice. The DVD is divided into sections so you can go right to the type of bow you want to make. Or, you can watch the entire thing all the way through which I did. You can make tiny bows for hair, decorative bows for packages, bows that include foil decorations, berries, flowers, or anything you can think of to include in the bow. They even demonstrate how to use up old scraps of ribbon to make a gorgeous bow. And these bows can get massive! You just have to see it after purchasing the Bow-dabra. I am planning a Bow-dabra party for my friends, to show them what all it will do. Summer is a great time to start thinking about Christmas decorations and gift wrapping so it would be fun to let each guest make a bow of their choosing. The guests can either bring their own ribbon and decorations or I could provide those. Either way, it's more fun if you do it yourself and have something to show. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that each bow you make uses a gold wire that is conveniently included in the Bow-dabra box. There is enough for about 10 bows. Do you can get the hang of it before buying more wire. The wire is only used to hold the bow together, so you could probably find some other colors. But I love the gold. It adds elegance to every bow. This is the cutest and most useful craft item I have seen in a long time. You just have to get one and try it for yourself. I LOVE this!"

        "Christmas decorations<<<vivid colors|||B09XM6ZN1Q ★★★★★ <b>Very Pretty Ribbons in Lots of Colors</b> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these 20 ribbons of 20 different colors. I like to use ribbons for card making, and these have just the right width (3/8 inch) and are DOUBLE-SIDED. It really looks so much better when tying bows, if the ribbon is double-sided. It just doesn’t look tidy when the “bad side” of a one sided ribbon shows up after tying a bow. Other Positives: 1) The colors are vivid, there are 20 colors. Two of the colors are gold and silver. The gold and silver are shimmery and has a grosgrain look to it. 2) The ribbons have a smooth, satin finish to it. It is made of 100% polyester. Very easy to work with and making bows. The cut ends will fray. Sometimes I use a bit of glue on the ends to stop the fraying. 3) As soon as I saw all the colors, I thought of all the different cards I can make. Red ribbon for Valentine’s and Christmas, Orange and black for Halloween, blue for July 4th, etc. 4) Value priced, too at 48 cents a spool. There are 15 yards per roll for a total of 300 yards. This will last me a long time. These ribbons are great to have on hand for crafting, gift wrapping, or party events. I recommend them for value and quality."

        "hanging things|||B09MBZC8Q8 ★★★☆☆ <b>Nice, with a couple of issues.</b> This ribbon looks nice enough if you just need something to use to hang thinga with, but I was disappointed for several reasons. The first is my fault: I really didn't do the math well when I ordered this, and I just didn't realize how short a length I would get off each color. Some of these colors are gorgeous, but others I know I'm unlikely to use again. That tends to mean the colors I don't like will pile up, if I try to re-purchase more of the ones I do like - and that will happen quickly, with only 1 yard of each color. I really, really hate the way these were packed. The product picture shows each color rolled separately, but that's not what you get. Instead, you get about a half-dozen large rolls, which contain multiple colors. Without unrolling each one, it's impossible to see what's there. Because of this before I could even use the ribbon, I spent an hour and a half unrolling the big rolls and making small, individual rolls with each color. After that, I can see and access them all easily. But honestly, I really had much better things to do with my time than repack 30 yards of ribbon. The quality isn't bad. I had hoped for thicker ribbon, as I planned to use these to make necklaces and I want them to last. A thicker pile to the ribbon would prevent it from wrinkling too easily, and would keep it from looking prematurely worn. Anything I make from these, I will have to charge a bit less for and warn customers that the necklace cord will eventually wear out. What I do like: many of these colors are stunning. It is nice to have a sampler to allow me to figure out what I need most. I really hope that they hold up better than I am expecting. Time will tell. If all you need is ribbons for trim, or to hang ornaments from, these are a good choice. I think, however, they for my purposes, I am going to have to keep looking for higher quality."

It best assists when working with multiple materials and/or layers but is easiest to learn on single layered bows. This device would be most useful as a gift for individuals who experience pain, fatigue, or difficulty with fine motor movements. This set arrives with the main gadget, a ruler that slots on top and then a piece to evenly scrunch down your DIY bow. In addition, it also includes a CD-ROM, membership on the website and a roll of metallic tie. Personally, I feel as though the CD-ROM format is very dated; in order to access the tutorial, there is an application that must run. This did not launch on my computer and I could not gain access to it despite many attempts. I also accessed the website and the PDF walkthroughs to best understand how to complete a bow with the assistance of this device. It was well explained in the written guides online, with step-by-step instructions and visuals. The idea behind this tool is useful, but more-so for individuals looking for a quick way to assemble their scraps into a reusable and presentable form. A lot of the styles in the provided examples are dated and much more appropriate for an older crowd. The number one feature I found was that this holds your material in place while you assemble and tie it all together.

Unfortunately I bought this ribbon to serve as page markers for a Bible rebind. So, this ribbon is just too cheap looking and flimsy for that use. Value for me is zero. QUALITY: mediocre to poor, extremely thin material with almost invisible edge detail. PACKAGING: Unlike ribbon sold at brick and mortar stores, this roll came rolled around a core and in a cellophane envelope, but with no chip board sides to prevent the entire roll from falling off the sides of the core and totally tangling. PRODUCT LISTENING: Sold as Dark Red Double Faced Color is subjective but this roll of Dk Red appears to this purchaser to be closer to Light Red Wine in color. With a decidedly different texture on the reverse side, it is highly doubtful that this can be considered “Double Faced”. SUMMARY: If you are looking for ribbon for decoration, say for hair ribbons or seasonal decor, or for more permanent items like sewing into a dress or to make book markers, look elsewhere.

Cards scrapbooking adorning clothing, hats you name it this sky's the limit. I like how the 20 colors of 100 yards of ribbon come in a nice display package with little indentations to keep each roll. That's really neat. I did notice that a couple of my 🌈 rainbow colors had less on the roll than the other rolls had, so I don't know what's up with that but every inch counts. Today my mom and I decided to string some really nice pony beads I'm also testing onto a length of the lime green ribbon. To make sure that the beads would stay on for my mom we knotted one near the bottom of one end of the length that I kind of measured not with tape just kind of put it around my neck and figured out how big I'd want it for it to go over her neck easy. Since we both shake with essential tremor, I wanted to make it easier for her to string the thin ribbon into the big pony bead openings. So I wrapped some Scotch tape around the other end. I wish I could show you that first video I made for you guys. I had it too thick and somehow I also had it the tape on slow motion? So it's really weird but it would take too long to upload I'm sure. Also my mom was joking with me and pulling the tip of the ribbon away so I couldn't stick the little bead on. It was funny you had to be there I guess haha just imagine it. 😜 Anyway, I made the tape narrower and it finally worked perfectly for my mom to string the beads on. It gives her practice with patterning and remembering colors and just hand eye coordination and all those mental gymnastics we need to do to keep our aging brains sharp. Plus she loves jewelry so making her own is even better. It's great how this pack of ribbon gives you so many colors at once without you having to buy 10,000 yards of each. Made in China."

I used it for a scrapbook craft, and as part of a hands on STEM project (where students had to \"sew\" two fake solar panels together, using it to learn about how repairs were done to the solar panels on the International space station) and it worked perfect. Great amount of ribbon for the price too!",
        "scrapbooking|||B06XNP8D5K ★★☆☆☆ <b>Disappointed… not at all what I expected</b> From the item description, I thought I was buying a quality double-faced satin ribbon suitable for hair ribbon and fine embellishment. This is a craft “quality?” ribbon (junk, if I am being polite) that was a waste of money for me. Have never seen low quality ribbon like this so I wasn’t aware that it existed. Not worth the time and money to return. Will be allotted to the junk drawer where it will likely remain forever after. Might be acceptable to use for package ribbon, card making or scrapbooking, but the “quality” is not up to my standards to be used in anything I would make.",
        "embellishing scrapbook pages|||B00SQKW6RG ★★★★☆ <b>\"Premium double-faced satin ribbon - versatile and high quality for all your crafting and decoratin</b> I absolutely love the Ribbon Bazaar Double Faced Satin Ribbon! This ribbon has a premium gloss finish that adds a touch of elegance to any gift wrapping or crafting project. The fact that it is made of 100% polyester ensures its durability and longevity. The variety of colors and widths available make it versatile for any occasion or creative endeavor. Whether I am adding a bow to a gift, creating hair accessories, or embellishing scrapbook pages, this ribbon always adds a beautiful and polished touch. The double-faced feature of this ribbon means that both sides have the same lustrous finish, making it perfect for projects where both sides will be visible. The edges are also neatly finished, preventing fraying and allowing for easy handling and manipulation. I appreciate the quality and consistency of Ribbon Bazaar products. The ribbon maintains its shape and color even after being tied and re-tied multiple times. It holds its position well, making it easy to achieve the desired look. Overall, the Ribbon Bazaar Double Faced Satin Ribbon is a top-notch product that I highly recommend. Its premium gloss finish, durability, and versatility make it a must-have for any gift wrapping, crafting, or decorating needs.",

Double-face means no matter how you tie bows or knots, there are no ‘wrong’ sides showing. Dozens of uses, especially at the holidays. When I want to give ‘thank you’ cash to mail person, UPS, FedEx, Amazon drivers, recycle and landfill and yard waste bin pick-up people, etc., I tape a length of this narrow ribbon inside each holiday card and tie it around the bills I’ve folded to fit. Thus makes me sound like Lady Bountiful on Boxing Day, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. I’m a wage slave, too, I just feel better saying ‘thanks’ to the people who help out all year, especially in these crazy times, even if it means I need to skip drive-throughs and lattes-to-go for several weeks. I digress: good quality ribbon in a great shade of red at a more-than-fair price."
