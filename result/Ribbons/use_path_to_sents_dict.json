I was expecting these ribbons to be of a certain length (22 yards PER roll) when I received them. These ribbons were purchased to be cut in certain lengths to be tied around trees & utility poles. FOUR of the ten rolls were not a consecutive 22 yards. They were cut & another piece taped on. It was like they ran out of ribbon so they added scrap ribbon to make up the difference. This caused my measure to be inaccurate for what I needed. Otherwise, the ribbon itself was a beautiful shade of pink, they were soft, the satin seemed like good quality but did gray easily.###pretty<3:9>|beware<22:28>|length<32:38>|certain<111:118>|length<119:125>|yard<130:135>|22 yard<127:135>|yard per roll<130:144>|roll<140:144>|receive<153:161>|cut<203:206>|certain<210:217>|length<218:224>|length<218:225>|tie<232:236>|tree<244:249>|utility<252:259>|pole<260:265>|roll<283:287>|roll<283:288>|cut<305:308>|22 yard<312:320>|yard<315:320>|cut<332:335>|piece<346:351>|tape<352:357>|run<379:382>|add<405:410>|scrap<411:416>|difference<439:449>|cause<456:462>|measure<466:473>|inaccurate<480:490>|otherwise<510:519>|beautiful<545:554>|a beautiful shade<543:560>|shade<555:560>|shade of pink<555:568>|pink<564:568>|soft<580:584>|satin<590:595>|gray<629:633>|easily<634:640>"

I actually bought this to make big labels. My sewing machine has a couple of fonts on and I can write things with it. I wanted to make a black stripe on a hand towel that had my dad’s name, apt# and phone. I found that running the ribbon through the sewing machine gave it wavy edges. It still worked but it really wants to warp even as I was sewing. So the text is a bit diagonal on the ribbon. I am planning to use this for packages from now on.

This is for Breast Cancer awareness, so it really needed to be pink. It's peach. It's not even close to pink. Since the front cardboard label was torn off (which is the part that has the name of the color of the ribbon), it makes me wonder if someone ran out of pink and just substituted this hoping it would work. If that's what happened, it doesn't work - at all. If that's not what happened, this is fraudulent marketing. This is not pink - not by a long shot. The picture is definitely pink, but this ribbon is definitely peach. Won't be returning since that's too much trouble...so I'm stuck with peach ribbon that won't work for my Breast Cancer awareness.... So disappointed!

I attached photos to lengths of ribbon for a wall display, and I used some to tie around vases for the table centerpieces.

Especially with Mother's Day around the corner, there's an endless amount of possibilities of what you can do with this ribbon to turn something simple and customize it with your own style. I chose the red ribbon and I've already started wrapping with it. Because of how thin the ribbon is, this would be better for smaller gifts if you'd like to wrap a ribbon around it. Or, you can also tie this to the handle of a bag to make it a little different. Larger gifts might require thicker or wider bows, and therefore this might not be appropriate by itself. It can work as a compliment to a bigger bow. I typically go for ribbons with wires just because they're a little easier to work with when you need the ribbon to conform to a specific angle or shape, but this wasn't difficult to use. The only thing that I would say is that if you typically tape or staple your ribbons sometimes to keep them in place, this isn't the ribbon that's going to cooperate well. Hot glue guns might be better to use when working with this ribbon to get it to form a particular shape or angle. Some examples of craft projects I'm currently working on are using these ribbons on small vases and wrapping of small items for jewelries and handmade bracelets. The feel of the ribbon felt okay. It didn't feel as soft as I expected but more like paper. I would still get this again but in different colors for other DIY projects I'm thinking about.###crafts<13:19>|addition<66:74>|a great addition<58:74>|current<82:89>|craft<90:95>|project<96:104>|craft project<90:104>|especially<122:132>|mother<138:144>|day<147:150>|mother day<138:150>|endless<181:188>|amount<189:195>|tie<208:211>|possibility<199:212>|turn<252:256>|thin<261:265>|simple<267:273>|own<301:304>|style<305:310>|choose<314:319>|red<324:327>|already<344:351>|start<352:359>|wrap<360:364>|wrapping<360:368>|wrap<360:368>|thin<393:397>|small<438:443>|small<438:445>|gift<446:451>|wrap<469:473>|tie<511:514>|handle<527:533>|bag<539:542>|different<563:572>|large<574:580>|gift<581:586>|require<593:600>|thick<601:608>|wide<612:617>|bow<618:621>|bow<618:622>|therefore<628:637>|appropriate<656:667>|compliment<696:706>|big<712:718>|big bow<712:722>|bow<719:722>|a big bow<710:722>|typically<726:735>|wire<756:761>|form<843:847>|specific<853:861>|angle<862:867>|shape<871:876>|difficult<894:903>|thin<921:925>|typically<959:968>|tape<969:973>|staple<977:983>|sometimes<997:1006>|keep<1010:1014>|place<1023:1028>|hot<1084:1087>|hot glue<1084:1092>|glue<1088:1092>|glue gun<1088:1097>|gun<1093:1097>|hot glue gun<1084:1097>|form<1164:1168>|particular<1171:1181>|shape<1182:1187>|angle<1191:1196>|example<1203:1211>|craft<1215:1220>|craft project<1215:1229>|project<1221:1229>|current<1234:1241>|currently<1234:1243>|small<1282:1287>|vase<1288:1293>|wrap<1298:1302>|wrap<1298:1306>|wrapping<1298:1306>|small<1310:1315>|jewelry<1326:1335>|handmade<1340:1348>|bracelet<1349:1358>|feel<1364:1368>|feel<1383:1387>|feel<1404:1408>|soft<1412:1416>|paper<1445:1450>|still<1460:1465>|again<1475:1480>|different<1488:1497>|diy<1515:1518>|project<1519:1527>|diy project<1515:1527>|thin<1532:1536>",

The texture is matte, not shiny, which I prefer. Each spool has 5 yards of ribbon for a total of 15 yards. The price seems a bit high for this type of ribbon and I’m sure it’s due to the wooden spools. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. Sometimes having reusable wooden spools is exactly why I’ve made a specific purchase. This ribbon can be used in a variety of ways. I’ll be using when wrapping Christmas gifts, for hanging ornaments on my Christmas tree, and for embellishing fall/winter clothes I’ll be sewing for my granddaughters. I’ll add pictures when I can. I recommend this item only if you plan to reuse the wooden spools once the ribbon has been used.###spool<5:10>|spool<5:11>|3 spool<3:11>|lovely<15:21>|dark<22:26>|green<27:32>|opaque<33:39>|vine<54:58>|customer<59:67>|free<78:82>|set<96:99>|wooden<105:111>|spool<112:117>|wooden spool<105:118>|spool<112:118>|dark<122:126>|green<127:132>|opaque<133:139>|fray<152:158>|edge<159:164>|satiny<171:177>|feel<178:182>|one side<186:194>|side<190:194>|texture<214:221>|matte<225:230>|shiny<236:241>|prefer<251:257>|each spool<259:269>|spool<264:269>|yard<276:281>|5 yard<274:281>|total<298:303>|yard<310:315>|15 yard<307:315>|5 yard<308:315>|high<339:343>|type<353:357>|type of ribbon<353:367>|wooden<397:403>|spool<404:409>|the wooden spool<393:410>|wooden spool<397:410>|spool<404:410>|keep<412:416>|mind<425:429>|sometimes<468:477>|reusable<485:493>|wooden<494:500>|spool<501:506>|wooden spool<494:507>|spool<501:507>|specific<535:543>|variety<583:590>|wrap<619:627>|christmas<628:637>|christmas gift<628:643>|gift<638:643>|hang<649:656>|ornament<657:666>|christmas<673:682>|christmas tree<673:687>|tree<683:687>|embellish<697:709>|fall<710:714>|winter<715:721>|clothe<722:729>|sew<738:744>|granddaughter<752:766>|add<773:776>|picture<777:785>|recommend<800:809>|plan<832:836>|reuse<840:845>|wooden<850:856>|spool<857:862>|wooden spool<850:863>|the wooden spool<846:863>|spool<857:863>"

I just wrap the ribbon once around the present, tie it in a bow like a shoelace, and I’m done. With the large assortment of Christmas colors and designs you get in this package (and I like them all), I was able to find a nice match for every Christmas paper I have. Only thing I don’t like is that they aren’t on a spool, so I have a rather large mess of different ribbons now sitting in my wrapping bag, but these are cloth and don’t tangle up tightly together, so they are easy to separate when you want to use again. These ribbons were all I needed this year for all my Christmas wrapping.###assortment<9:19>|christmas<24:33>|wrap<54:58>|present<59:66>|present<59:67>|fancy<84:89>|wrap<135:139>|once<151:155>|present<167:174>|tie<176:179>|bow<188:191>|large<232:237>|assortment<238:248>|christmas<252:261>|design<273:280>|package<297:304>|able<334:338>|find<342:346>|match<354:359>|christmas<370:379>|paper<380:385>|spool<443:448>|large<469:474>|mess<475:479>|different<483:492>|now<501:504>|sit<505:512>|wrap<519:523>|wrapping<519:527>|bag<528:531>|cloth<547:552>|tangle<563:569>|tightly<573:580>|together<581:589>|separate<611:619>|again<641:646>|this year<680:689>|year<685:689>|christmas<701:710>|wrap<711:715>|christmas wrapping<701:719>|wrapping<711:719>"

The texture is matte, not shiny, which I prefer. Each spool has 5 yards of ribbon for a total of 15 yards. The price seems a bit high for this type of ribbon and I’m sure it’s due to the wooden spools. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. Sometimes having reusable wooden spools is exactly why I’ve made a specific purchase. This ribbon can be used in a variety of ways. I’ll be using when wrapping Christmas gifts, for hanging ornaments on my Christmas tree, and for embellishing fall/winter clothes I’ll be sewing for my granddaughters. I’ll add pictures when I can. I recommend this item only if you plan to reuse the wooden spools once the ribbon has been used.###spool<5:10>|spool<5:11>|3 spool<3:11>|lovely<15:21>|dark<22:26>|green<27:32>|opaque<33:39>|vine<54:58>|customer<59:67>|free<78:82>|set<96:99>|wooden<105:111>|spool<112:117>|wooden spool<105:118>|spool<112:118>|dark<122:126>|green<127:132>|opaque<133:139>|fray<152:158>|edge<159:164>|satiny<171:177>|feel<178:182>|one side<186:194>|side<190:194>|texture<214:221>|matte<225:230>|shiny<236:241>|prefer<251:257>|each spool<259:269>|spool<264:269>|yard<276:281>|5 yard<274:281>|total<298:303>|yard<310:315>|15 yard<307:315>|5 yard<308:315>|high<339:343>|type<353:357>|type of ribbon<353:367>|wooden<397:403>|spool<404:409>|the wooden spool<393:410>|wooden spool<397:410>|spool<404:410>|keep<412:416>|mind<425:429>|sometimes<468:477>|reusable<485:493>|wooden<494:500>|spool<501:506>|wooden spool<494:507>|spool<501:507>|specific<535:543>|variety<583:590>|wrap<619:627>|christmas<628:637>|christmas gift<628:643>|gift<638:643>|hang<649:656>|ornament<657:666>|christmas<673:682>|christmas tree<673:687>|tree<683:687>|embellish<697:709>|fall<710:714>|winter<715:721>|clothe<722:729>|sew<738:744>|granddaughter<752:766>|add<773:776>|picture<777:785>|recommend<800:809>|plan<832:836>|reuse<840:845>|wooden<850:856>|spool<857:862>|wooden spool<850:863>|the wooden spool<846:863>|spool<857:863>"

The color is exactly as pictured on the photo. It’s a nice shiny “old gold” color that will be prefect for holiday vibes without being Christmas theme. It’s a nice soft pliable ribbon that is easy to shape and tie so it works perfect for my use. It’s also the perfect size for small bows for a little pop of color on holiday presents. My only complaint is that it tends to fray where it is cut. This is fixed by using a lighter to melt the ends and stop the fraying. Overall I think it’s a good quality for the cheap price since and you get a lot of ribbon for your money. I would recommend.###picture<23:31>|fray<35:39>|fray<35:40>|cut<47:50>|bow<87:91>|dog<99:102>|groom<103:111>|job<112:115>|picture<141:149>|photo<157:162>|shiny<176:181>|old gold<183:191>|gold<187:191>|prefect<212:219>|holiday<224:231>|vibe<232:237>|christmas<252:261>|theme<262:267>|christmas theme<252:267>|soft<281:285>|pliable<286:293>|shape<317:322>|tie<327:330>|perfect size<377:389>|the perfect size<373:389>|size<385:389>|small<394:399>|bow<400:404>|pop<418:421>|pop of color<418:430>|holiday<434:441>|present<442:450>|only complaint<455:469>|complaint<460:469>|tend<481:486>|end<482:486>|fray<490:494>|cut<507:510>|fix<520:525>|light<537:544>|melt<548:552>|end<557:561>|stop<566:570>|fray<575:579>|fraying<575:582>|overall<584:591>|cheap<628:633>|lot of ribbon<660:673>|money<683:688>|recommend<698:707>",

It best assists when working with multiple materials and/or layers but is easiest to learn on single layered bows. This device would be most useful as a gift for individuals who experience pain, fatigue, or difficulty with fine motor movements. This set arrives with the main gadget, a ruler that slots on top and then a piece to evenly scrunch down your DIY bow. In addition, it also includes a CD-ROM, membership on the website and a roll of metallic tie. Personally, I feel as though the CD-ROM format is very dated; in order to access the tutorial, there is an application that must run. This did not launch on my computer and I could not gain access to it despite many attempts. I also accessed the website and the PDF walkthroughs to best understand how to complete a bow with the assistance of this device. It was well explained in the written guides online, with step-by-step instructions and visuals. The idea behind this tool is useful, but more-so for individuals looking for a quick way to assemble their scraps into a reusable and presentable form. A lot of the styles in the provided examples are dated and much more appropriate for an older crowd. The number one feature I found was that this holds your material in place while you assemble and tie it all together. Otherwise, it is a very simplistic device with more of a purpose for those who may have difficulty with fine motor skills but want to design and complete decorative bows on their own.###simple<3:9>|tool<10:14>|bow<27:30>|making<31:37>|bow making<27:37>|bow<47:50>|bowdabra<47:55>|bow<60:63>|hairbow<56:63>|making<64:70>|hit<71:74>|tool<86:90>|hold<95:102>|project<108:115>|place<119:124>|consistent<129:139>|tightly<144:151>|craft<152:159>|bow<160:163>|bow<160:164>|multiple<210:218>|material<219:227>|material<219:228>|layer<236:242>|learn<261:266>|single<270:276>|bow<285:288>|bow<285:289>|device<296:302>|most<312:316>|useful<317:323>|gift<329:333>|individual<338:349>|experience<354:364>|pain<365:369>|difficulty<383:393>|movement<410:419>|set<426:429>|arrive<430:437>|main<447:451>|gadget<452:458>|ruler<462:467>|top<482:485>|piece<497:502>|evenly<506:512>|run<515:518>|own<522:525>|diy<531:534>|bow<535:538>|addition<543:551>|include<561:569>|cd<572:574>|website<598:605>|roll<612:616>|metallic<620:628>|tie<629:632>|personally<634:644>|feel<648:652>|cd<667:669>|form<674:678>|date<689:694>|access<708:714>|application<741:752>|run<763:766>|access<824:830>|attempt<850:858>|access<867:873>|access<867:875>|website<880:887>|understand<921:931>|complete<939:947>|bow<950:953>|device<982:988>|write<1019:1026>|online<1034:1040>|step<1047:1051>|step<1055:1059>|instruction<1060:1072>|idea<1090:1094>|tool<1107:1111>|useful<1115:1121>|individual<1139:1150>|assemble<1178:1186>|scrap<1193:1199>|reusable<1207:1215>|presentable<1220:1231>|form<1232:1236>|style<1251:1257>|provide<1265:1273>|example<1274:1282>|date<1287:1292>|appropriate<1307:1318>|number<1343:1349>|feature<1354:1361>|find<1364:1369>|hold<1384:1389>|material<1395:1403>|place<1407:1412>|assemble<1423:1431>|tie<1436:1439>|together<1447:1455>|otherwise<1457:1466>|device<1492:1498>|purpose<1514:1521>|difficulty<1545:1555>|skill<1572:1578>|design<1591:1597>|complete<1602:1610>|decorative<1611:1621>|bow<1622:1625>|bow<1622:1626>|decorative bow<1611:1626>|own<1636:1639>"

Ironing it flattens it out, but I shouldn’t have to iron 150 feet of ribbon straight off the roll before I can use it! Also, on some of the ribbon the edge crimping was out of alignment and not actually on the edge (shown on the top ribbon in the 3rd picture). I can’t use the parts of the roll with defects like this. I will add, though, that I did end up talking to their customer support, and I must say that they do have great customer service!###disappoint<3:15>|beautiful<52:61>|sage<62:66>|green<67:72>|sage green color<62:78>|match<80:87>|david<88:93>|bridal<96:102>|dusty<103:108>|sage<109:113>|wedding<156:163>|favor<164:170>|wedding favor<156:170>|disappointed<185:197>|wrinkle<228:236>|roll<256:260>|roll<256:262>|styrofoam<270:279>|iron<281:288>|flatten<292:300>|iron<333:337>|foot<342:346>|foot of ribbon<342:356>|straight<357:365>|roll<374:378>|edge<432:436>|actually<475:483>|edge<491:495>|show<497:502>|top<510:513>|picture<532:539>|part<558:563>|roll<571:575>|defect<581:588>|add<607:610>|though<612:618>|end<631:634>|customer<655:663>|support<664:671>|customer<712:720>|customer service<712:728>|service<721:728>"

Due to COVID we had change our wedding plans and purchased a few loose ends. I bought two of these and both of them had a dark brown streak in the middle of the ribbon. When I saw the streak on the first, I thought maybe something had happened to it. These things happen. But it was on BOTH.

I bought it for wedding favors, but I’m very disappointed in the quality. The ribbon is wrinkled from the way it is rolled on the Styrofoam. Ironing it flattens it out, but I shouldn’t have to iron 150 feet of ribbon straight off the roll before I can use it! Also, on some of the ribbon the edge crimping was out of alignment and not actually on the edge (shown on the top ribbon in the 3rd picture). I can’t use the parts of the roll with defects like this. I will add, though, that I did end up talking to their customer support, and I must say that they do have great customer service!###disappoint<3:15>|beautiful<52:61>|sage<62:66>|green<67:72>|sage green color<62:78>|match<80:87>|david<88:93>|bridal<96:102>|dusty<103:108>|sage<109:113>|wedding<156:163>|favor<164:170>|wedding favor<156:170>|disappointed<185:197>|wrinkle<228:236>|roll<256:260>|roll<256:262>|styrofoam<270:279>|iron<281:288>|flatten<292:300>|iron<333:337>|foot<342:346>|foot of ribbon<342:356>|straight<357:365>|roll<374:378>|edge<432:436>|actually<475:483>|edge<491:495>|show<497:502>|top<510:513>|picture<532:539>|part<558:563>|roll<571:575>|defect<581:588>|add<607:610>|though<612:618>|end<631:634>|customer<655:663>|support<664:671>|customer<712:720>|customer service<712:728>|service<721:728>"

It was elegant, sheer, and soft with a bit of a sheen to it and worked perfectly in the sanctuary to add an elegant touch to the decor. It was also a huge quantity for the money and very nice quality. It came spooled around a piece of foam which worked well. It does not have any wire to it and had a soft flowy feel instead. It is not glittery, but shiny and see-through. I found that it cut well with sharp fabric scissors that had not dulled on other things. If you don't have sharp scissors it may be difficult to cut cleanly without the edges fraying (this is typical for fragile fabrics). Overall I highly recommend.###soft<3:7>|sheer<9:14>|organza<15:22>|sheer organza<9:22>|sheen<37:42>|thick<71:76>|burlap<77:83>|silk<95:99>|flower<100:107>|aisle<112:117>|decor<118:123>|decoration<118:129>|wedding<137:144>|elegant<153:160>|sheer<162:167>|soft<173:177>|sheen<194:199>|perfectly<217:226>|add<247:250>|elegant<254:261>|touch<262:267>|elegant touch<254:267>|an elegant touch<251:267>|decor<275:280>|huge<296:300>|quantity<301:309>|money<318:323>|spool<355:362>|piece<372:377>|foam<381:385>|wire<426:430>|soft<447:451>|flowy<452:457>|feel<458:462>|instead<463:470>|glittery<482:490>|shiny<496:501>|find<521:526>|cut<535:538>|sharp<549:554>|fabric<555:561>|scissor<562:570>|fabric scissor<555:570>|dull<584:590>|sharp<626:631>|scissor<632:640>|sharp scissor<626:640>|difficult<651:660>|cut<664:667>|cleanly<668:675>|edge<688:693>|fray<694:701>|typical<711:718>|fragile<723:730>|fabric<731:737>|fabric<731:738>|overall<741:748>|highly<751:757>|recommend<758:767>"

It’s the perfect width, the perfect sheerness to it, and it looks SO expensive! I’ve received so many compliments on our wedding invitations, and this ribbon really made them look far more expensive than they were (thank you DIY projects!) When I was ordering, I was nervous I bought too little/too much. I spent an hour doing the math— I ordered three packs of this ribbon and was able to do 123 invites exact. That was with leaving 3-4 inches on both sides to be able to tie the ribbon. Will definitely be buying more for our thank you cards and for still photos! So happy with this purchase!###market<36:42>|the perfect width<77:94>|width<89:94>|sheerness<108:117>|expensive<141:150>|receive<157:165>|compliment<174:185>|many compliment<169:185>|wedding<193:200>|invitation<201:212>|wedding invitation<193:212>|far<252:255>|expensive<261:270>|thank<287:292>|diy<297:300>|project<301:309>|diy project<297:309>|spend<379:384>|hour<388:392>|an hour<385:392>|math<403:407>|the math<399:407>|pack<425:430>|able<454:458>|invite<469:476>|exact<477:482>|leave<498:505>|4 inch<508:516>|inch<510:516>|side<525:530>|both side<520:530>|able<537:541>|tie<545:548>|definitely<566:576>|thank<600:605>|card<610:615>|still<624:629>|photo<630:636>|happy<641:646>",

It would probably work well also as hair bows for babies/young children, or even to tie around a ponytail. The color is nice, and true to what it looks like in the picture here. I do think it is probably limited to one use, just given the fragility of the fabric, but for the cost I don’t think that’s unreasonable. This would also be great to make centerpieces for a party, shower, wedding, etc. paired with flowers or candle holders.###pretty<8:14>|gift<26:30>|gift<26:31>|decor<35:40>|pretty<58:64>|gift<85:89>|gift wrapping<85:98>|wrapping<90:98>|decor<106:111>|decoration<106:116>|probably<127:135>|hair<154:158>|hair bow<154:163>|bow<159:163>|bow for baby<159:174>|baby<168:174>|young<175:180>|child<181:189>|tie<202:205>|ponytail<215:223>|picture<282:289>|probably<313:321>|limit<322:329>|give<347:352>|fabric<374:380>|cost<394:398>|centerpiece<467:479>|party<486:491>|shower<493:499>|wedding<501:508>|pair<515:521>|flower<527:534>|candle<538:544>|holder<545:552>",

I did 1 large and 5 small bouquets, 2 mini bouquets for the flower girls (pictured), and 9 boutonnières.

Overall I was happy with the quality and sheerness of the Material and it was great quantity for what I needed.###invite<13:19>|invite<13:20>|wrap<41:45>|wedding<46:53>|invite<54:60>|invite<54:61>|wedding invite<46:61>|invite<79:85>|invite<79:86>|inch<119:125>|chiffon<129:136>|invite<141:147>|invite<178:184>|invite<178:185>|wonder<190:199>|invite<231:237>|invite<231:238>|almost<245:251>|roll<263:267>|roll<263:268>|3 roll<261:268>|leave<276:280>|roll<301:305>|invite<315:321>|invite<315:322>|overall<334:341>|happy<348:353>|sheerness<375:384>|material<392:400>|quantity<418:426>"

My daughter is getting married and her colors are pinks and variations of pinks. These are going to be part of centerpieces on the main tables. The lovely little bit of fray on the edges add some texture to the display. The pink ribbons are sheer. (We did not look much at the red one.) The ribbon has a flowing quality so if you tie bows they will not be 'bow like' but rather more floppy bows. We are not using this for bows, rather we are going to use it along with some cheese cloth twisted loosely down the center of the tables.###lovely<3:9>|pretty<27:33>|daughter<38:46>|marry<58:65>|pink<85:89>|pink<85:90>|variation<95:105>|pink<109:113>|pink<109:114>|part<138:142>|center<146:152>|centerpiece<146:158>|main<166:170>|table<171:177>|lovely<183:189>|fray<204:208>|edge<216:221>|add<222:225>|texture<231:238>|display<246:253>|pink<259:263>|sheer<276:281>|red<312:315>|flow<339:346>|tie<365:368>|bow<369:372>|bow<369:373>|bow<392:395>|floppy<418:424>|bow<425:428>|bow<425:429>|floppy bow<418:429>|bow<457:460>|bow<457:461>|cloth<516:521>|twist<522:529>|loosely<530:537>|center<547:553>|table<561:567>"

It was elegant, sheer, and soft with a bit of a sheen to it and worked perfectly in the sanctuary to add an elegant touch to the decor. It was also a huge quantity for the money and very nice quality. It came spooled around a piece of foam which worked well. It does not have any wire to it and had a soft flowy feel instead. It is not glittery, but shiny and see-through. I found that it cut well with sharp fabric scissors that had not dulled on other things. If you don't have sharp scissors it may be difficult to cut cleanly without the edges fraying (this is typical for fragile fabrics).

Much cuter than typically gift ribbon and great price!###re<20:22>|definitely<57:67>|re<68:70>|re<87:89>|re<123:125>|dress<122:127>|flower<134:140>|flower girl<134:146>|girl<141:146>|basket<148:154>|flower girl basket<134:155>|basket<148:155>|girl basket<141:155>|wrap<159:166>|basket<169:175>|handle<176:183>|tie<202:205>|tie<202:206>|large<209:214>|bow<215:219>|large bow<209:219>|still<232:237>|re<289:291>|rest<289:293>|the rest<285:293>|tie<297:300>|name<301:305>|name tag<301:310>|tag<306:310>|gift<316:320>|bag<321:325>|gift bag<316:325>|re<339:341>|bridesmaid<356:367>|re<370:372>|linen<375:380>|feel<381:385>|drape<391:397>|nicely<398:404>|cut<411:416>|typically<422:431>|gift<432:436>|re<449:451>"

It was elegant, sheer, and soft with a bit of a sheen to it and worked perfectly in the sanctuary to add an elegant touch to the decor. It was also a huge quantity for the money and very nice quality. It came spooled around a piece of foam which worked well. It does not have any wire to it and had a soft flowy feel instead. It is not glittery, but shiny and see-through. I found that it cut well with sharp fabric scissors that had not dulled on other things. If you don't have sharp scissors it may be difficult to cut cleanly without the edges fraying (this is typical for fragile fabrics). Overall I highly recommend.###soft<3:7>|sheer<9:14>|organza<15:22>|sheer organza<9:22>|sheen<37:42>|thick<71:76>|burlap<77:83>|silk<95:99>|flower<100:107>|aisle<112:117>|decor<118:123>|decoration<118:129>|wedding<137:144>|elegant<153:160>|sheer<162:167>|soft<173:177>|sheen<194:199>|perfectly<217:226>|add<247:250>|elegant<254:261>|touch<262:267>|elegant touch<254:267>|an elegant touch<251:267>|decor<275:280>|huge<296:300>|quantity<301:309>|money<318:323>|spool<355:362>|piece<372:377>|foam<381:385>|wire<426:430>|soft<447:451>|flowy<452:457>|feel<458:462>|instead<463:470>|glittery<482:490>|shiny<496:501>|find<521:526>|cut<535:538>|sharp<549:554>|fabric<555:561>|scissor<562:570>|fabric scissor<555:570>|dull<584:590>|sharp<626:631>|scissor<632:640>|sharp scissor<626:640>|difficult<651:660>|cut<664:667>|cleanly<668:675>|edge<688:693>|fray<694:701>|typical<711:718>|fragile<723:730>|fabric<731:737>|fabric<731:738>|overall<741:748>|highly<751:757>|recommend<758:767>"

It's hard to see in the photo but it's tied around that wooden sign that's hanging off the chair, and that worked out perfectly and matched well with my flowers.###definitely<19:29>|recommend<30:39>|chiffon<66:73>|wedding<88:95>|scheme<102:108>|color scheme<96:108>|chance<116:122>|project<144:152>|find<156:160>|decorate<181:189>|day<201:204>|definitely<219:229>|plan<237:241>|accurate<257:265>|photo<273:278>|sheerness<295:304>|hard<359:363>|photo<378:383>|tie<393:397>|wooden<410:416>|sign<417:421>|hang<429:436>|chair<445:450>|perfectly<472:481>|match<486:493>|flower<507:514>"

I like that they are varying widths, so they can be used for different purposes. Everything feels strong, and like it will hold up well. It forms a bow easily because of the texture of the ribbon.

The metallic gold plays off of the burlap very well and I like the wired edges. That said, this does not make a good big fluffy bow with lots of loops. This is a better choice for the clipped bows that use several different ribbons that are cris-crossed and then pulled up. Or a simple one loop bow tied with some string or raffia in the middle. This is a great ribbon for gift wrapping and tying a gift bag. I used some of this at Christmas for some gift bags but I was happy that most of the designs were neutral so I can use them for a relative's 50's anniversary coming up soon.

The metallic gold plays off of the burlap very well and I like the wired edges. That said, this does not make a good big fluffy bow with lots of loops. This is a better choice for the clipped bows that use several different ribbons that are cris-crossed and then pulled up. Or a simple one loop bow tied with some string or raffia in the middle. This is a great ribbon for gift wrapping and tying a gift bag. I used some of this at Christmas for some gift bags but I was happy that most of the designs were neutral so I can use them for a relative's 50's anniversary coming up soon. Getting 6 rolls for just under $20 is a good value as well.###pretty<8:14>|metallic<15:23>|burlap<28:34>|big<58:61>|fluffy<62:68>|big fluffy<58:68>|bow<76:79>|bow<97:100>|christmas<117:126>|2.5 inch<134:142>|inch<138:142>|6 roll<143:150>|roll<145:150>|yards<154:159>|gold<160:164>|burlap<165:171>|wired<179:184>|wired ribbon<179:191>|shiny<202:207>|gold<208:212>|metallic<213:221>|gold metallic ribbon<208:228>|pretty<242:248>|metallic<254:262>|metallic gold<254:267>|gold<263:267>|play<268:273>|burlap<285:291>|wired<317:322>|edge<323:328>|wired edge<317:328>|the wired edge<313:328>|big<367:370>|fluffy<371:377>|big fluffy<367:377>|bow<378:381>|loop<395:399>|loop<395:400>|choice<419:425>|clip<434:441>|bow<442:445>|bow<442:446>|different<464:473>|cross<496:503>|pull<513:519>|simple<529:535>|loop<540:544>|bow<545:548>|loop bow<540:548>|tie<549:553>|string<564:570>|middle<588:594>|the middle<584:594>|gift<623:627>|gift wrapping<623:636>|wrapping<628:636>|tie<641:646>|gift<649:653>|gift bag<649:657>|bag<654:657>|a gift bag<647:657>|christmas<682:691>|gift<701:705>|bag<706:709>|gift bag<701:709>|bag<706:710>|gift bag<701:710>|happy<721:726>|most<732:736>|design<744:751>|neutral<757:764>|anniversary<805:816>|soon<827:831>|roll<843:848>|6 roll<841:848>"

Ordered 2 varieties for 2 different companies. Although feel like same company but different sellers. On page looks like burlap-type fabric so was going to use on tree. In person, it's a cheesecloth/gauze type fabric. What gives it legs is the quality of the dye. The color, especially on the darker blue, is even with True to color hue. This set in Sky Blue, Navy & White is my fave to use on magnetic gift boxes. Most boxes have a gloss finish & the gauze in contrast looks simply tasteful. Plus the lightweight lets you layer colors to give more depth to the eye. You will need 3 hands to tie it on a glossy surface but the end result shines. The other set was in Burgundy, Pink & White but didn't figure out layering til the blue. No I am not redoing bows but this set has grown on me so give it a chance. Definitely can't find 15 yards of ribbon anywhere for 10 bucks so it's worth the shot.###gauze<3:8>|type<9:13>|colors<40:46>|originally<65:75>|fence<83:88>|tie<126:129>|variety<121:130>|different<137:146>|company<147:156>|feel<167:171>|same<177:181>|company<182:189>|different<194:203>|seller<204:211>|page<216:220>|burlap<232:238>|type<239:243>|fabric<244:250>|tree<274:278>|person<283:289>|cheesecloth<298:309>|gauze<310:315>|type<316:320>|fabric<321:327>|give<334:338>|give<334:339>|dye<370:373>|especially<386:396>|dark<404:410>|dark blue<404:415>|blue<411:415>|hue<444:447>|set<454:457>|sky<461:464>|blue<465:469>|navy<471:475>|white<478:483>|gift<514:518>|box<519:524>|gift box<514:524>|most<526:530>|box<531:536>|gloss<544:549>|finish<550:556>|gauze<563:568>|contrast<572:580>|simply<587:593>|tasteful<594:602>|lightweight<613:624>|let<625:629>|layer<634:639>|give<650:654>|depth<660:665>|eye<673:676>|hand<694:699>|tie<703:706>|gloss<715:720>|glossy<715:721>|surface<722:729>|end<738:741>|result<742:748>|shine<749:755>|set<767:770>|burgundy<778:786>|pink<788:792>|white<795:800>|figure<812:818>|layer<823:828>|layer<823:831>|blue<840:844>|bow<866:870>|set<880:883>|give<903:907>|chance<913:919>|a chance<911:919>|definitely<921:931>|find<938:942>|yard<946:951>|15 yard<943:951>|anywhere<962:970>|buck<978:983>|worth<992:997>|shot<1002:1006>"

Ordered 2 varieties for 2 different companies. Although feel like same company but different sellers. On page looks like burlap-type fabric so was going to use on tree. In person, it's a cheesecloth/gauze type fabric. What gives it legs is the quality of the dye. The color, especially on the darker blue, is even with True to color hue. This set in Sky Blue, Navy & White is my fave to use on magnetic gift boxes. Most boxes have a gloss finish & the gauze in contrast looks simply tasteful. Plus the lightweight lets you layer colors to give more depth to the eye. You will need 3 hands to tie it on a glossy surface but the end result shines. The other set was in Burgundy, Pink & White but didn't figure out layering til the blue. No I am not redoing bows but this set has grown on me so give it a chance. Definitely can't find 15 yards of ribbon anywhere for 10 bucks so it's worth the shot.###gauze<3:8>|type<9:13>|colors<40:46>|originally<65:75>|fence<83:88>|tie<126:129>|variety<121:130>|different<137:146>|company<147:156>|feel<167:171>|same<177:181>|company<182:189>|different<194:203>|seller<204:211>|page<216:220>|burlap<232:238>|type<239:243>|fabric<244:250>|tree<274:278>|person<283:289>|cheesecloth<298:309>|gauze<310:315>|type<316:320>|fabric<321:327>|give<334:338>|give<334:339>|dye<370:373>|especially<386:396>|dark<404:410>|dark blue<404:415>|blue<411:415>|hue<444:447>|set<454:457>|sky<461:464>|blue<465:469>|navy<471:475>|white<478:483>|gift<514:518>|box<519:524>|gift box<514:524>|most<526:530>|box<531:536>|gloss<544:549>|finish<550:556>|gauze<563:568>|contrast<572:580>|simply<587:593>|tasteful<594:602>|lightweight<613:624>|let<625:629>|layer<634:639>|give<650:654>|depth<660:665>|eye<673:676>|hand<694:699>|tie<703:706>|gloss<715:720>|glossy<715:721>|surface<722:729>|end<738:741>|result<742:748>|shine<749:755>|set<767:770>|burgundy<778:786>|pink<788:792>|white<795:800>|figure<812:818>|layer<823:828>|layer<823:831>|blue<840:844>|bow<866:870>|set<880:883>|give<903:907>|chance<913:919>|a chance<911:919>|definitely<921:931>|find<938:942>|yard<946:951>|15 yard<943:951>|anywhere<962:970>|buck<978:983>|worth<992:997>|shot<1002:1006>"

I love this sturdy, silky, brightly-colored ribbon. It is a great value for such a pretty ribbon—the fabric is woven tightly and sturdily, and the double-sided weave means you’ll have a shiny front-facing ribbon in every curve and twist and loop. I ordered this in yellow and the color is bright and true to the listing. The edges are finished securely but still very flexible and drape nicely. I’m going to use this to tie sunflowers 🌻 for my wedding bouquet! 💐###delightful<3:13>|double<43:49>|sided<50:55>|double sided ribbon<43:62>|love<66:70>|sturdy<76:82>|silky<84:89>|bright<91:97>|pretty<147:153>|fabric<165:171>|weave<175:180>|tightly<181:188>|double<211:217>|sided<218:223>|weave<224:229>|mean<230:235>|shiny<250:255>|front<256:261>|face<262:268>|twist<295:300>|loop<305:309>|yellow<329:335>|bright<353:359>|listing<376:383>|the listing<372:383>|edge<389:394>|finish<399:407>|securely<408:416>|still<421:426>|flexible<432:440>|drape<445:450>|nicely<451:457>|tie<484:487>|sunflower<488:498>|wedding<508:515>|bouquet<516:523>|wedding bouquet<508:523>"

I will not buy this brand of ribbon again.###piece<14:19>|piece<14:20>|together<21:29>|brand<51:56>|this brand<46:56>|again<67:72>|decorate<89:97>|large<98:103>|wedding<104:111>|gift<112:117>|decent<126:132>|weight<133:139>|shiny<145:150>|slick<155:160>|most<166:170>|satin<171:176>|negative<197:205>|white<214:219>|white<228:233>|main<245:249>|issue<250:255>|roll<266:270>|yard<303:308>|tape<314:319>|roll<327:331>|continuous<340:350>|length<351:357>|continuous length<340:357>|count<363:371>|tape<376:381>|piece<385:390>|probably<397:405>|10 yard<411:419>|yard<414:419>|far<423:426>|roll<460:464>|tape<468:473>|together<474:482>|matter<495:501>|brand<544:549>|this brand<539:549>|again<560:565>"

Nicely frayed. Love the spools for bridal detail photos.</b> I will be using this ribbon for bridal/wedding detail photos. The ribbon is just the right width for these types of shots: not too thin or too wide. It creates amazing interest when trailing through a photo of an invitation suite or curled around the wedding rings. The ribbon actually appears 2-sided. One side is clearly shiny, the other is more matte. The fraying is natural, but tidy. My favorite part of this set, though, is the inclusion of the spools!! I’ve been hoping to add spools to my detail kit… and here they are! They are also the perfect size. Enough to add pop and interest to a picture, but not so large or bulky to take away from the actual bridal details themselves. My only wish would be to have the option to mix and match colors. Since this ribbon is not for a specific craft or one-use project in my case, I would prefer a choice of colors rather than 3 spools of the same color. But, I’d still buy another Vitalizart set. The gray/silver is beautiful, and the price for their spooled ribbon is very affordable.###beautiful<3:12>|nicely<21:27>|fray<28:34>|love<36:40>|spool<45:51>|bridal<56:62>|detail<63:69>|photo<70:75>|photo<70:76>|detail photo<63:76>|bridal<114:120>|wedding<121:128>|wedding detail<121:135>|detail<129:135>|photo<136:141>|photo<136:142>|detail photo<129:142>|width<173:178>|the right width<163:178>|right width<167:178>|type<189:194>|shot<198:203>|thin<213:217>|wide<225:229>|create<234:241>|interest<250:258>|trail<264:272>|photo<283:288>|invitation<295:305>|curl<315:321>|wedding<333:340>|ring<341:346>|actually<359:367>|appear<368:375>|side<378:382>|sided<378:383>|side<389:393>|one side<385:393>|clearly<397:404>|shiny<405:410>|matte<430:435>|more matte<425:435>|fraying<441:448>|natural<452:459>|tidy<465:469>|favorite<474:482>|part<483:487>|set<496:499>|though<501:507>|spool<533:539>|hope<552:558>|add<562:565>|spool<566:572>|detail<579:585>|kit<586:589>|size<636:640>|perfect size<628:640>|the perfect size<624:640>|add<652:655>|pop<656:659>|interest<664:672>|picture<678:685>|large<698:703>|bulky<707:712>|away<721:725>|bridal<742:748>|detail<749:755>|detail<749:756>|only wish<772:781>|wish<777:781>|option<803:809>|mix<813:816>|match<821:826>|specific<866:874>|craft<875:880>|project<892:899>|case<906:910>|prefer<920:926>|choice<929:935>|spool<960:966>|3 spool<958:966>|same<974:978>|the same color<970:984>|still<995:1000>|vitalizart<1013:1023>|set<1024:1027>|gray<1033:1037>|silver<1038:1044>|beautiful<1048:1057>|spool<1083:1090>|affordable<1106:1116>"

It is not durable enough for trim that will get wear and tear. It is shinier, thinner, and more supple than I expected from grosgrain. On the positive: it might work well for accessories/decorations that are disposable, such as wedding decor and gift wrapping, and for those crafts the texture and suppleness might be what you want.###sturdy<7:13>|sewing<25:31>|project<32:40>|sewing project<25:40>|trim<63:67>|sewing<71:77>|project<78:86>|sewing project<71:86>|fragile<98:105>|use as trim<110:121>|trim<117:121>|bind<125:132>|garment<136:144>|accessory<148:159>|bag<168:172>|split<177:183>|snag<187:192>|stitch<203:209>|line<210:214>|mistake<229:236>|remove<246:252>|stitch<257:263>|stitch<257:265>|durable<277:284>|trim<296:300>|wear<315:319>|tear<324:328>|shiny<336:343>|thin<345:352>|supple<363:369>|grosgrain<391:400>|positive<409:417>|accessory<442:453>|decor<454:459>|decoration<454:465>|wedding<495:502>|wedding decor<495:508>|decor<503:508>|gift<513:517>|wrapping<518:526>|gift wrapping<513:526>|craft<542:548>|texture<553:560>|supple<565:571>"

I like to use ribbons for card making, and these have just the right width (3/8 inch) and are DOUBLE-SIDED. It really looks so much better when tying bows, if the ribbon is double-sided. It just doesn’t look tidy when the “bad side” of a one sided ribbon shows up after tying a bow. Other Positives: 1) The colors are vivid, there are 20 colors. Two of the colors are gold and silver. The gold and silver are shimmery and has a grosgrain look to it. 2) The ribbons have a smooth, satin finish to it. It is made of 100% polyester. Very easy to work with and making bows. The cut ends will fray. Sometimes I use a bit of glue on the ends to stop the fraying. 3) As soon as I saw all the colors, I thought of all the different cards I can make. Red ribbon for Valentine’s and Christmas, Orange and black for Halloween, blue for July 4th, etc. 4) Value priced, too at 48 cents a spool. There are 15 yards per roll for a total of 300 yards. This will last me a long time. These ribbons are great to have on hand for crafting, gift wrapping, or party events. I recommend them for value and quality.###pretty<8:14>|ribbons<15:22>|lots<26:30>|colors<34:40>|pleasantly<51:61>|surprise<62:71>|different<113:122>|card<157:161>|making<162:168>|card making<157:168>|the right width<190:205>|width<200:205>|right width<194:205>|3/8 inch<207:215>|inch<211:215>|double<225:231>|double sided<225:237>|sided<232:237>|tie<275:280>|bow<281:284>|bow<281:285>|double<304:310>|side<311:315>|sided<311:316>|double sided<304:316>|tidy<339:343>|side<358:362>|side<373:377>|sided<373:378>|show<386:391>|tie<401:406>|bow<409:412>|positive<420:429>|vivid<449:454>|gold<499:503>|silver<508:514>|gold<520:524>|silver<529:535>|shimmery<540:548>|grosgrain<559:568>|smooth<603:609>|satin<611:616>|finish<617:623>|polyester<650:659>|100 polyester<645:659>|making<688:694>|bow<695:698>|bow<695:699>|cut<705:708>|end<709:713>|fray<719:723>|sometimes<725:734>|glue<750:754>|end<762:766>|stop<770:774>|fray<779:783>|fraying<779:786>|soon<794:798>|different<845:854>|card<855:859>|card<855:860>|red<873:876>|valentine<888:897>|christmas<904:913>|orange<915:921>|black<926:931>|halloween<936:945>|blue<947:951>|july<956:960>|4th<961:964>|spool<1006:1011>|yard<1026:1031>|15 yard<1023:1031>|roll<1036:1040>|yard per roll<1026:1040>|total<1047:1052>|yard<1060:1065>|300 yard<1056:1065>|long<1087:1091>|a long time<1085:1096>|long time<1087:1096>|hand<1133:1137>|craft<1142:1150>|gift<1152:1156>|gift wrapping<1152:1165>|wrapping<1157:1165>|party<1170:1175>|event<1176:1182>|recommend<1186:1195>"

The ribbon sheds a fair amount of glitter and gets everywhere a bit so be mindful of that, but the ribbon is still sparkly on the tree. I used two strands from two rolls to go around my 7ft tree which is approx 130cm wide. I used two strands so that I would have the desired gap between layers at my desired angle all the way around the tree. It looks lovely and much nicer than tinsel. This was the only wide ribbon I could find online in the UK. The last photo is to show how much ribbon was used to achieve the look I did, the roll on the left is unopened, and the other two rolls are the rolls I took my two strands from (I didn’t use strands from the same roll incase the roll ran out mid second-strand) I recommend the product.###beautiful<9:18>|christmas<22:31>|tree<32:36>|christmas tree<22:36>|gold<52:56>|pack<57:61>|7 ft<95:98>|ft<96:98>|artificial<99:109>|tree<110:114>|shed<127:132>|fair<135:139>|amount<140:146>|fair amount<135:146>|glitter<150:157>|amount of glitter<140:157>|everywhere<167:177>|still<225:230>|sparkly<231:238>|tree<246:250>|run<265:268>|strand<263:269>|strand<263:270>|two strand<259:270>|roll<280:284>|two roll<276:285>|roll<280:285>|ft<303:305>|7 ft<302:305>|ft tree<303:310>|tree<306:310>|approx<320:326>|cm<330:332>|wide<333:337>|run<352:355>|strand<350:356>|two strand<346:357>|strand<350:357>|desire<383:390>|gap<391:394>|layer<403:409>|desire<416:423>|angle<424:429>|tree<453:457>|lovely<468:474>|wide<521:525>|find<541:545>|online<546:552>|photo<573:578>|show<585:589>|achieve<618:625>|roll<646:650>|ft<660:662>|left<658:662>|roll<694:698>|roll<694:699>|two roll<690:699>|roll<708:712>|roll<708:713>|run<730:733>|strand<728:734>|strand<728:735>|two strand<724:735>|run<757:760>|strand<755:761>|strand<755:762>|same<772:776>|roll<777:781>|roll<793:797>|run<798:801>|mid<806:809>|second<810:816>|run<819:822>|strand<817:823>|recommend<827:836>",

        "Decorating front window###decorate<0:10>|front<11:16>|window<17:23>|||B0C53N99FX ★★★★☆ [2023-08-20] <b>Some fraying, Still good quality</b> Already prepping for Christmas (it’s August) and this year I’ve decided I need to have a deco mesh wreath on my front window. This is a fairly priced set of ribbon given what I’ve seen locally, and there are a good range of colors including the darker red, which I have yet to see in person. I haven’t worked with much deco ribbon in the past but this seems to unravel a bit more than I would have hoped for. I need to use some tape/glue mixture on the ends to help stopgap the problem before weaving it in and out. I’m not sure if a project involving lots of smaller pieces would be possible with this ribbon given the fraying.###fraying<8:15>|still<17:22>|already<40:47>|christmas<61:70>|year<94:98>|this year<89:98>|decide<104:111>|deco<129:133>|mesh<134:138>|deco mesh wreath<129:145>|wreath<139:145>|front<152:157>|window<158:164>|fairly<176:182>|set<190:193>|set of ribbon<190:203>|give<204:209>|locally<225:232>|range<255:260>|range of color<255:270>|include<271:280>|dark<285:291>|dark red<285:295>|red<292:295>|yet<310:313>|person<324:330>|deco<359:363>|past<378:382>|unravel<401:408>|hope<438:443>|tape<468:472>|glue<473:477>|end<493:497>|help<501:505>|problem<518:525>|weave<533:540>|project<574:581>|small<600:607>|piece<608:614>|small piece<600:614>|possible<624:632>|give<650:655>|fraying<660:667>",

My mom is planning the shower for our church family and local friends, so I'm helping her make all of the decorations. One of my favorite things we made was a DIY satin ribbon garland/banner. This was such a fun & easy project! I cut the ribbon colors into 3'(ish) long strips, then used a lighter to melt/seal the ends. After that, I folded each ribbon piece in half and made a slipknot around a piece of paracord. I alternated the colors until the garland was about 5-6 feet long. I'm going to hang it either across the front of a table or on the wall. I love that I can then save this and re-use it for baby's first birthday party!

Pros: -High quality ribbon -Available in TONS of sizes and colors -Easy to use for crafts - just seal the ends with a lighter Cons: -None! I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review. All opinions expressed are completely my own.###beautiful<11:20>|baby<27:31>|baby shower<27:38>|shower<32:38>|shower decor<32:44>|decor<39:44>|re<56:58>|double<71:77>|faced<78:83>|satin<84:89>|faced satin<78:89>|double faced satin<71:89>|faced satin ribbon<78:96>|light<100:105>|light pink<100:110>|pink<106:110>|decor<140:145>|baby<153:157>|shower<158:164>|baby shower<153:164>|mom<169:172>|plan<176:184>|shower<189:195>|church<204:210>|family<211:217>|local<222:227>|end<231:235>|friend<228:235>|help<244:251>|decor<272:277>|decoration<272:283>|favorite<295:303>|diy<325:328>|satin<329:334>|garland<342:349>|banner<350:356>|fun<374:377>|project<385:392>|cut<396:399>|long<431:435>|long strip<431:442>|strip<436:442>|light<456:463>|melt<467:471>|seal<472:476>|end<481:485>|fold<501:507>|piece<520:525>|half<529:533>|piece<563:568>|garland<616:623>|foot<638:642>|6 foot<636:642>|long<643:647>|hang<662:666>|front<688:693>|table<699:704>|wall<715:719>|love<723:727>|save<744:748>|re<758:760>|baby<772:776>|birthday<785:793>|birthday party<785:799>|party<794:799>|pro<801:805>|ton<842:846>|size<850:855>|craft<884:890>|seal<898:902>|end<907:911>|light<919:926>|con<927:931>|re<942:944>|receive<942:950>|re<966:968>|free<965:969>|hang<976:980>|exchange<973:981>|honest<989:995>|re<996:998>|opinion<1008:1016>|re<1020:1022>|express<1017:1026>|re<1028:1030>|completely<1031:1041>|own<1045:1048>"

The colors on this set are just gorgeous, I would say they describe the color accurately as it is royal blue (and not navy) and is beautiful and vibrant, the product pics don't do it justice, they are even prettier in person.

I do think it is probably limited to one use, just given the fragility of the fabric, but for the cost I don’t think that’s unreasonable.

At less than $3 per roll they seem reasonably priced.###variety<8:15>|sister<23:29>|obsessed<42:50>|grinch<60:66>|pack<87:91>|pack of ribbon<87:102>|gift<119:124>|adorn<135:142>|set<169:172>|spool<176:181>|spool<176:182>|different<202:211>|grinch<212:218>|design<221:227>|design<221:228>|spool<235:240>|each spool<230:240>|yard<250:255>|five yard<245:255>|wired<259:264>|wired ribbon<259:271>|glitter<296:303>|base<304:309>|plain<333:338>|design<380:386>|design<380:387>|clear<392:397>|crisp<402:407>|variety<413:420>|match<441:446>|obvious<456:463>|grinch<464:470>|theme<471:477>|neutral<492:499>|course<504:510>|pack<601:605>|package<601:609>|decor<628:633>|craft<642:648>|adorn<650:658>|tree<661:665>|dress<667:675>|swag<681:685>|design<689:695>|element<696:703>|porch<707:712>|pot<713:717>|part<733:737>|room<769:773>|dinner<780:786>|part<787:791>|party<787:792>|place<822:828>|indoor<871:878>|careful<887:894>|pack<909:913>|away<919:923>|multiple<951:959>|season<960:967>|worth<968:973>|less<995:999>|roll<1012:1016>|reasonably<1027:1037>"

It has the most popular Christmas elements, the red truck, snowman, Santa, snowflakes and the traditional red and black gingham. They mix and match just wonderfully! They are not thin by any means and really have a nice weight and quality. Not sheer at all. The prints are only on one side (except the red and black gingham, that is the same on both sides) and that is not a problem at all as most ribbon is that way, just wanted to mention that. Perfect for your farmhouse creations. Timeless prints too! The wire is nice and sturdy. Colors are vibrant. Perfect for the finishing touches on Christmas gifts, wreaths, centerpieces, scrapbooking and more!

I have quite a few chiffon ribbons but those are more sheer than this material. The spool looks to be a standard thread spool size. I stock ribbons for several reasons. I do wedding photography and use the ribbons when styling a lay flat which is usually of the wedding couples’ details. Ya, brides don’t provide those things so we bring them lol. I also photograph newborns and milestones and these ribbons would really well for tiebacks and headbands that we make custom for our client closets. I love creating delicate outfits and accessories for my sweet little babies. The color is definitely a chocolate shade of champagne but very pretty. One side has shine and the other is matte so versatile as well.###lovely<3:9>|soft<20:24>|texture<25:32>|satin<42:47>|love<58:62>|lovely<58:64>|beautiful<71:80>|feel<91:95>|chiffon<116:123>|sheer<151:156>|material<167:175>|spool<181:186>|standard<201:209>|thread<210:216>|spool<217:222>|size<223:227>|stock<231:236>|reason<257:264>|wedding<271:278>|photography<279:290>|style<316:323>|lay<326:329>|lay flat<326:334>|flat<330:334>|usually<344:351>|wedding<359:366>|couple<367:374>|detail<376:383>|bride<389:395>|provide<402:409>|bring<429:434>|lol<440:443>|newborn<463:471>|tieback<527:535>|headband<540:549>|custom<563:569>|client<578:584>|love<596:600>|create<601:609>|delicate<610:618>|outfit<619:626>|accessory<631:642>|sweet<650:655>|baby<663:669>|definitely<684:694>|chocolate<697:706>|shade<707:712>|champagne<716:725>|pretty<735:741>|side<747:751>|one side<743:751>|shine<756:761>|matte<779:784>|versatile<788:797>",

Kinda Bummed</b> This ribbon works great for packaging my handmade jewelry. One small gripe, though: The roll I received is full of bends - not wrinkles, bends. I'm not sure if I received a somewhat defective batch, or not, but there are actual creases in the fabric. I tried ironing about a 2 foot piece, but I'm pretty sure it began to melt. Not only would I be unable to use a piece of ribbon that's half-melted, LOL, but I wouldn't be able to dedicate the time needed to press it. I already wish there were more hours in the day as it is, haha. I tried to pull (for lack of better terms. I'm not \"usina muh werds good\", I suppose, LOL) the ribbon flat, but that just left me with a stretched out piece of ribbon that was longer down the center than it was at the edges. Bummer. I gave this four stars as it's a beautiful color, a nice thickness, and I AM able to use it for the reason in which I purchased it. It's a great price, and I'm more likely than not to buy it again, but will keep my fingers crossed that I receive a wrinkle/bend-free spool next time!###mostly<3:9>|bent<26:30>|kinda<32:37>|package<77:86>|handmade<90:98>|jewelry<99:106>|small<112:117>|though<125:131>|roll<137:141>|receive<144:151>|receive<144:152>|full<156:160>|bend<164:168>|bend<164:169>|wrinkle<176:183>|wrinkle<176:184>|bend<186:190>|bend<186:191>|receive<211:218>|receive<211:219>|defective<231:240>|batch<241:246>|crease<277:284>|fabric<292:298>|iron<308:315>|foot<326:330>|2 foot<324:330>|piece<331:336>|pretty<346:352>|begin<361:366>|melt<370:374>|able<398:402>|unable<396:402>|piece<412:417>|piece of ribbon<412:427>|half<435:439>|melt<440:444>|melt<440:446>|lol<448:451>|able<471:475>|press<507:512>|already<519:526>|wish<527:531>|hour<548:553>|day<561:564>|pull<592:596>|lack<602:606>|term<617:622>|suppose<658:665>|lol<667:670>|flat<683:687>|leave<703:707>|stretch<718:727>|piece<732:737>|piece of ribbon<732:747>|long<757:763>|center<773:779>|edge<799:804>|give<816:820>|four star<826:836>|beautiful<847:856>|thickness<871:880>|nice thickness<866:880>|able<891:895>|reason<914:920>|likely<979:985>|again<1005:1010>|keep<1021:1025>|finger<1029:1036>|cross<1037:1044>|receive<1052:1059>|wrinkle<1062:1069>|bend<1070:1074>|free<1075:1079>|spool<1080:1085>",

Somewhat Bent. Kinda Bummed</b> This ribbon works great for packaging my handmade jewelry. One small gripe, though: The roll I received is full of bends - not wrinkles, bends. I'm not sure if I received a somewhat defective batch, or not, but there are actual creases in the fabric. I tried ironing about a 2 foot piece, but I'm pretty sure it began to melt. Not only would I be unable to use a piece of ribbon that's half-melted, LOL, but I wouldn't be able to dedicate the time needed to press it. I already wish there were more hours in the day as it is, haha. I tried to pull (for lack of better terms. I'm not \"usina muh werds good\", I suppose, LOL) the ribbon flat, but that just left me with a stretched out piece of ribbon that was longer down the center than it was at the edges. Bummer. I gave this four stars as it's a beautiful color, a nice thickness, and I AM able to use it for the reason in which I purchased it. It's a great price, and I'm more likely than not to buy it again, but will keep my fingers crossed that I receive a wrinkle/bend-free spool next time!###mostly<3:9>|bent<26:30>|kinda<32:37>|package<77:86>|handmade<90:98>|jewelry<99:106>|small<112:117>|though<125:131>|roll<137:141>|receive<144:151>|receive<144:152>|full<156:160>|bend<164:168>|bend<164:169>|wrinkle<176:183>|wrinkle<176:184>|bend<186:190>|bend<186:191>|receive<211:218>|receive<211:219>|defective<231:240>|batch<241:246>|crease<277:284>|fabric<292:298>|iron<308:315>|foot<326:330>|2 foot<324:330>|piece<331:336>|pretty<346:352>|begin<361:366>|melt<370:374>|able<398:402>|unable<396:402>|piece<412:417>|piece of ribbon<412:427>|half<435:439>|melt<440:444>|melt<440:446>|lol<448:451>|able<471:475>|press<507:512>|already<519:526>|wish<527:531>|hour<548:553>|day<561:564>|pull<592:596>|lack<602:606>|term<617:622>|suppose<658:665>|lol<667:670>|flat<683:687>|leave<703:707>|stretch<718:727>|piece<732:737>|piece of ribbon<732:747>|long<757:763>|center<773:779>|edge<799:804>|give<816:820>|four star<826:836>|beautiful<847:856>|thickness<871:880>|nice thickness<866:880>|able<891:895>|reason<914:920>|likely<979:985>|again<1005:1010>|keep<1021:1025>|finger<1029:1036>|cross<1037:1044>|receive<1052:1059>|wrinkle<1062:1069>|bend<1070:1074>|free<1075:1079>|spool<1080:1085>"

I will order for my Christmas project next.###fun<9:12>|decorating<13:23>|excited<41:48>|craft<61:66>|realize<81:89>|the wrong color<100:115>|wrong color<104:115>|project<123:130>|decide<148:155>|decorate<159:167>|outdoor<171:178>|cat<179:182>|autumn<187:193>|halloween<196:205>|metallic<217:225>|thread<226:232>|metallic thread<217:232>|volume<261:267>|statement<268:277>|lot of color<279:293>|choose<297:303>|decorate<321:331>|outdoor<348:355>|outdoors<348:356>|christmas<382:391>|project<392:399>"

Dark green leafy vine. However the vine is thin. I was hoping for a much more thicker approach. I should of researched the product better. This is thin and can be used for balloons or maybe an art project in a scrapbook or photo album, maybe a head piece for a holloween. This will not hold up as decorations or a banner (which is what I'm looking for). I'll use it as the string for our balloons and try and buy something else to edge the ceiling for the party.

Yo en una tienda local compré una mucho mejor y más gruesa y me salio el metro en $10. No digo que el producto sea malo, para otros usos puede ser la solución.

I am one of those rare people who enjoy wrapping presents (no gift bags for me). I think that a satin ribbon tied in a simple bow is the perfect finishing touch to a wrapped gift. This ribbon is perfect for this (and likely other) purposes. It’s a beautiful color, soft to the touch, with the perfect amount of shine. It’s lovely. I love it so much, I just purchased another roll in the lovely purple color to add some color to a Halloween costume. The only thing I will say that I dislike, is that it is a bit on the pricey side, but you pay for quality. It’s a durable ribbon, and I have cut it and have seen no evidence of any fraying and I have noticed other ribbons that are sold on amazon that reviews mention fraying when cut.###beautiful<3:12>|durable<14:21>|amount<35:41>|shine<45:50>|amount of shine<35:50>|people<102:108>|enjoy<113:118>|wrap<119:127>|present<128:136>|gift<141:145>|bag<146:150>|gift bag<141:150>|satin<175:180>|tie<188:192>|simple<198:204>|bow<205:208>|simple bow<198:208>|a simple bow<196:208>|finish<224:233>|touch<234:239>|wrap<245:252>|gift<253:257>|likely<296:302>|other purpose<303:318>|purpose<310:318>|beautiful<327:336>|soft<344:348>|touch<356:361>|the perfect amount<368:386>|amount<380:386>|amount of shine<380:395>|shine<390:395>|love<402:406>|lovely<402:408>|love<412:416>|roll<454:458>|another roll<446:458>|love<466:470>|lovely<466:472>|purple<473:479>|add<489:492>|halloween<509:518>|halloween costume<509:526>|costume<519:526>|dislike<561:568>|pricey<597:603>|side<604:608>|pay<618:621>|durable<642:649>|cut<669:672>|fraying<709:716>|notice<728:735>|sell<759:763>|mention<787:794>|fraying<795:802>|cut<808:811>"

VALUE: If this ribbon was going to the trash with wrapping paper, $4.99 for 100 yards is a good value. I’m giving the supplier credit that there actually are 100 yards on the roll. Unfortunately I bought this ribbon to serve as page markers for a Bible rebind. So, this ribbon is just too cheap looking and flimsy for that use. Value for me is zero. QUALITY: mediocre to poor, extremely thin material with almost invisible edge detail. PACKAGING: Unlike ribbon sold at brick and mortar stores, this roll came rolled around a core and in a cellophane envelope, but with no chip board sides to prevent the entire roll from falling off the sides of the core and totally tangling. PRODUCT LISTENING: Sold as Dark Red Double Faced Color is subjective but this roll of Dk Red appears to this purchaser to be closer to Light Red Wine in color. With a decidedly different texture on the reverse side, it is highly doubtful that this can be considered “Double Faced”. SUMMARY: If you are looking for ribbon for decoration, say for hair ribbons or seasonal decor, or for more permanent items like sewing into a dress or to make book markers, look elsewhere. If you only want to tie up a quick gift, or need wine colored string, go for it.###extremely<3:12>|thin<13:17>|double<26:32>|double faced<26:38>|faced<33:38>|pay<84:87>|kinda<94:99>|trash<140:145>|wrapping<151:159>|paper<160:165>|wrapping paper<151:165>|100 yard<177:186>|yard<181:186>|give<208:214>|supplier<219:227>|actually<246:254>|yard<263:268>|100 yard<259:268>|roll<276:280>|unfortunately<282:295>|serve<320:325>|page<329:333>|marker<334:341>|bible<348:353>|cheap<390:395>|looking<396:403>|cheap looking<390:403>|flimsy<408:414>|extremely<478:487>|thin<488:492>|material<493:501>|thin material<488:501>|almost<507:513>|edge<524:528>|detail<529:535>|packaging<537:546>|sell<562:566>|store<587:593>|roll<600:604>|roll<610:614>|roll<610:616>|core<626:630>|cellophane<640:650>|envelope<651:659>|board<678:683>|side<684:688>|side<684:689>|prevent<693:700>|entire<705:711>|roll<712:716>|the entire roll<701:716>|entire roll<705:716>|fall<722:729>|side<738:742>|side<738:743>|core<751:755>|totally<760:767>|tangle<768:776>|sell<797:801>|dark<805:809>|red<810:813>|dark red<805:813>|double<814:820>|faced<821:826>|double faced<814:826>|roll<856:860>|dk<864:866>|red<867:870>|appear<871:878>|close<903:909>|light<913:918>|red<919:922>|wine<923:927>|red wine<919:927>|different<955:964>|texture<965:972>|reverse<980:987>|side<988:992>|highly<1000:1006>|side<1036:1040>|consider<1033:1043>|double<1045:1051>|double faced<1045:1057>|faced<1052:1057>|looking<1080:1087>|decor<1103:1108>|decoration<1103:1113>|hair<1123:1127>|seasonal<1139:1147>|decor<1148:1153>|permanent<1167:1176>|sew<1188:1194>|dress<1202:1207>|book<1219:1223>|marker<1224:1231>|elsewhere<1238:1247>|tie<1269:1272>|gift<1284:1288>|wine<1298:1302>|colored<1303:1310>|string<1311:1317>"

This is a nice set of spools of ribbon with six different Grinch-y designs. Each spool has five yards of wired ribbon. Two of the ribbons are glitter based and the other four are plain. The ribbons are of good quality and the designs are clear and crisp. The variety is great as you can match the more obvious Grinch themes with the more neutral. Of course, you can use them singly as well. These are good enough quality that they can be used for packages but also for more decor related crafts. Adorning a tree, dressing up a swag, a design element of porch pots, using them as part of a tablescape in your dining room for a dinner party, all of these would be great places to utilize these ribbons. If you use them indoors and are careful about how you pack them away I think you could even get multiple seasons worth of use from them. At less than $3 per roll they seem reasonably priced.###variety<8:15>|sister<23:29>|obsessed<42:50>|grinch<60:66>|pack<87:91>|pack of ribbon<87:102>|gift<119:124>|adorn<135:142>|set<169:172>|spool<176:181>|spool<176:182>|different<202:211>|grinch<212:218>|design<221:227>|design<221:228>|spool<235:240>|each spool<230:240>|yard<250:255>|five yard<245:255>|wired<259:264>|wired ribbon<259:271>|glitter<296:303>|base<304:309>|plain<333:338>|design<380:386>|design<380:387>|clear<392:397>|crisp<402:407>|variety<413:420>|match<441:446>|obvious<456:463>|grinch<464:470>|theme<471:477>|neutral<492:499>|course<504:510>|pack<601:605>|package<601:609>|decor<628:633>|craft<642:648>|adorn<650:658>|tree<661:665>|dress<667:675>|swag<681:685>|design<689:695>|element<696:703>|porch<707:712>|pot<713:717>|part<733:737>|room<769:773>|dinner<780:786>|part<787:791>|party<787:792>|place<822:828>|indoor<871:878>|careful<887:894>|pack<909:913>|away<919:923>|multiple<951:959>|season<960:967>|worth<968:973>|less<995:999>|roll<1012:1016>|reasonably<1027:1037>",

The strap is suede and I. Hard on shoes so I did proactively reinforce them by hand sewing them down as well as using the sticky back. The hand sewing was tough because of the adhesive and thick leather i was attaching to. I’m not sure how a sewing machine would do with it since the “beads” are close together. The rose gold color was really nice. It was easy to cut through to get the length I wanted. The adhesive back was really easy to use and seems pretty sticky. I would definitely purchase again.###pair<54:58>|add<73:76>|accent<82:88>|strap<103:108>|strap<103:109>|strap<115:120>|suede<124:129>|hard<137:141>|shoe<145:150>|hand<190:194>|sewing<195:201>|sew<195:201>|sticky<233:239>|back<240:244>|hand<250:254>|sew<255:261>|sewing<255:261>|tough<266:271>|adhesive<287:295>|thick<300:305>|leather<306:313>|attach<320:329>|sew<353:359>|sewing<353:359>|sewing machine<353:367>|machine<360:367>|bead<396:401>|close<407:412>|together<413:421>|rose<427:431>|the rose gold<423:436>|rose gold<427:436>|gold<432:436>|rose gold color<427:442>|cut<475:478>|length<498:504>|adhesive<519:527>|back<528:532>|pretty<566:572>|sticky<573:579>|definitely<589:599>|again<609:614>",

Cards scrapbooking adorning clothing, hats you name it this sky's the limit. I like how the 20 colors of 100 yards of ribbon come in a nice display package with little indentations to keep each roll. That's really neat. I did notice that a couple of my 🌈 rainbow colors had less on the roll than the other rolls had, so I don't know what's up with that but every inch counts. Today my mom and I decided to string some really nice pony beads I'm also testing onto a length of the lime green ribbon. To make sure that the beads would stay on for my mom we knotted one near the bottom of one end of the length that I kind of measured not with tape just kind of put it around my neck and figured out how big I'd want it for it to go over her neck easy. Since we both shake with essential tremor, I wanted to make it easier for her to string the thin ribbon into the big pony bead openings. So I wrapped some Scotch tape around the other end. I wish I could show you that first video I made for you guys. I had it too thick and somehow I also had it the tape on slow motion? So it's really weird but it would take too long to upload I'm sure. Also my mom was joking with me and pulling the tip of the ribbon away so I couldn't stick the little bead on. It was funny you had to be there I guess haha just imagine it. 😜 Anyway, I made the tape narrower and it finally worked perfectly for my mom to string the beads on. It gives her practice with patterning and remembering colors and just hand eye coordination and all those mental gymnastics we need to do to keep our aging brains sharp. Plus she loves jewelry so making her own is even better. It's great how this pack of ribbon gives you so many colors at once without you having to buy 10,000 yards of each.

I made the mistake of using a glittered cardstock, which made getting anything to stick on it quite the challenge. However, for this border we just put a layer of hot glue onto the border and then stuck it on the textured cardstock and had no issues with it falling off! This border is WAY more beautiful in person and it just shimmers in the light. It’s a solid and very high quality border. Highly recommend.###justice<30:37>|border<58:64>|cap<71:74>|graduation<87:97>|many compliment<109:125>|compliment<114:125>|mistake<138:145>|cardstock<167:176>|stick<209:214>|challenge<231:240>|however<242:249>|border<260:266>|put<275:278>|layer<281:286>|hot<290:293>|hot glue<290:298>|glue<294:298>|border<308:314>|stick<324:329>|texture<340:348>|cardstock<349:358>|no issue<367:376>|issue<370:376>|fall<385:392>|border<403:409>|beautiful<422:431>|person<435:441>|shimmer<454:462>|light<470:475>|solid<484:489>|high<499:503>|high quality<499:511>|border<512:518>|highly<520:526>|recommend<527:536>"

This ribbon I wanted to try to see if it \"behaved\" like other satin ribbon I have used that were a comparable width. Turns out this ribbon is softer and less structured than the other satins I have used. Not saying that is a bad thing, it's more of a style thing. This ribbon will produce more romantic looking bows. They will be flowy. I loved the color which will lend itself to school colors. It is super soft and cut easily. I like to add little touches of ribbon when I decorate and this will work for that as well. The burnt orange is also an awesome Autumn tone.

The ribbon arrived packaged in a box and comes in 3 rolls. The ivory color is very pretty with no strong yellow tones. The frayed edges add a nice soft touch. The fraying is even and neat so it really lends a clean look to the ribbon. The quality of this ribbon is excellent and the ribbon was very easy to work with and tie into a bow. I added a photo of how I used it to embellish an altered book. I think it really softened the look of my project and I just love it. I look forward to using this in my ribbon flags, the frayed edges will add such a nice look and some dimension. There are so many uses for this ribbon from crafting, hair bows, or simply just embellishing wrapped gifts and packages. I read that another reviewer was using this ribbon on a bouquet and that sounds lovely, too. The quality is just that nice.

Very fine, thin ribbon perfect for gift wrapping or patriotic décor. Are you a crafter? These will look amazing on a wreath. The second picture shows a US quarter on top of the white roll for scale. Because the ribbon is so fine, these rolls are not as small as they seem. There are two different blues just in case your monitor isn't picking up the difference. One is more royal and the other more navy.

I didn't think anything of it being smaller than my other 50 yard spools because I thought it was due to the smaller core. Nowhere on the spool label or cellophane wrap did it give a yardage size.

More specifically, I 3D print a few layers of an object, stop the print, tape a strip of this down over the print bed, then start the print again. Result: a 3D printed object directly bonded to fabric, that can then be sewn into costumes or attached to something else.

It is perfect to put on greeting cards that I make and I love that it is almost the exact shade of Stampin Up’s garden green. With 25 yards on the role it is unlikely that I will ever use at all so I have shared with some of my crafty friends. I think this would also make a great trim to a child’s dress or a garment. This would be perfect for any holiday ornaments that you’re making or samplers.

Ich war ganz gespannt wie sich dieses Band embossen lässt, also mit einem Heißluftfön Pigmente einbrennen.

Lovely shade of gold.</b> Beautiful shade of gold - quite elegant, not \"loud\". Good quality. But overpriced. If buying in quantity view it as a long-term investment. I recommend reading the product title extra carefully as it's the product description. One reviewer complains it's not curling ribbon, but it doesn't say it's curling ribbon and you can tell it's not curling ribbon from the advert photo. It is \"gift-wrapping\" ribbon, as per the description, in that you wrap it around the gift and/or tie a bow to embellish. Bought to: 1. Wrap around homemade gatefold greeting cards (as the kind of 'belly band' you untie). 2. Make ribbon bows to embellish greeting cards. 3. Sew in inside a greeting card the paper to write on and sign. Impressive for little effort and so better than glue. This ribbon glues well, using high-tack glue, hold the bits together (or use a clip) for a while afterwards though.

        "Wrapping around homemade gatefold greeting cards###wrap<0:8>|homemade<16:24>|greeting<34:42>|greeting card<34:48>|card<43:48>|||B08BLFJPSF ★★★★☆ [2022-02-23] <b>Good quality. Lovely shade of gold.</b> Beautiful shade of gold - quite elegant, not \"loud\". Good quality. But overpriced. If buying in quantity view it as a long-term investment. I recommend reading the product title extra carefully as it's the product description. One reviewer complains it's not curling ribbon, but it doesn't say it's curling ribbon and you can tell it's not curling ribbon from the advert photo. It is \"gift-wrapping\" ribbon, as per the description, in that you wrap it around the gift and/or tie a bow to embellish. Bought to: 1. Wrap around homemade gatefold greeting cards (as the kind of 'belly band' you untie). 2. Make ribbon bows to embellish greeting cards. 3. Sew in inside a greeting card the paper to write on and sign. Impressive for little effort and so better than glue. This ribbon glues well, using high-tack glue, hold the bits together (or use a clip) for a while afterwards though. The gold colour will look great on Christmas cards. I came here to order more in case it becomes unavailable, and to consider other colours, because with scores to make I'll start making them soon (I know people who've already started). Therefore, if you're considering buying, don't delay and maybe buy a bit more in case :-)###lovely<17:23>|shade<24:29>|lovely shade<17:29>|shade of gold<24:37>|gold<33:37>|beautiful<43:52>|shade<53:58>|shade of gold<53:66>|gold<62:66>|elegant<75:82>|overprice<114:124>|buying<129:135>|quantity<139:147>|long<161:165>|long term<161:170>|term<166:170>|recommend<185:194>|read<195:202>|title<215:220>|extra<221:226>|carefully<227:236>|description<257:268>|the product description<245:268>|reviewer<274:282>|complain<283:292>|curl<302:309>|curl<342:349>|curl<383:390>|photo<414:419>|gift<428:432>|wrap<433:437>|gift wrapping<428:441>|wrapping<433:441>|description<462:473>|wrap<487:491>|gift<506:510>|tie<518:521>|bow<524:527>|embellish<531:540>|wrap<556:560>|homemade<568:576>|greeting<586:594>|greeting card<586:599>|card<595:599>|greeting card<586:600>|card<595:600>|kind<609:613>|belly<618:623>|band<624:628>|tie<636:639>|untie<634:639>|bow<657:660>|bow<657:661>|embellish<665:674>|greeting<675:683>|card<684:688>|greeting card<675:688>|card<684:689>|greeting card<675:689>|sew<694:697>|greeting<710:718>|greeting card<710:723>|card<719:723>|paper<728:733>|write<737:742>|sign<750:754>|impressive<756:766>|effort<778:784>|glue<804:808>|glue<822:826>|glue<822:827>|high<840:844>|glue<850:854>|hold<856:860>|together<870:878>|clip<889:893>|while<901:906>|though<918:924>|gold<930:934>|colour<935:941>|christmas<961:970>|card<971:975>|christmas card<961:976>|card<971:976>|case<1007:1011>|become<1015:1022>|consider<1043:1051>|colour<1058:1064>|colour<1058:1065>|start<1100:1105>|soon<1118:1122>|people<1131:1137>|already<1145:1152>|start<1153:1158>|start<1153:1160>|therefore<1163:1172>|consider<1184:1192>|consider<1184:1195>|buying<1196:1202>|case<1244:1248>",

Instead of a garish, bright red, it is a muted, elegant shade. It is so very lush and velvety that it makes even the simplest packages look posh. Only one side of the ribbon is plush. The other is a ribbed, satiny texture. Because it isn't wide, it's easy to tie and wrap with, and it looks delicate and tasteful. I plan to use it to wrap presents, but I might also use some as ornament hangers and to decorate cards with. I can see using it to festoon a wreath with as well.###lush<3:7>|soft<9:13>|special<25:32>|wrap<33:37>|wrapping<33:41>|project<42:50>|love<57:62>|deep<67:71>|burgundy<73:81>|deep burgundy color<67:87>|instead<104:111>|bright<125:131>|red<132:135>|bright red<125:135>|muted<145:150>|elegant<152:159>|shade<160:165>|lush<181:185>|velvety<190:197>|simple<221:229>|package<230:238>|one side<255:263>|side<259:263>|plush<281:286>|lush<282:286>|rib<303:309>|satiny<311:317>|texture<318:325>|wide<344:348>|tie<363:366>|wrap<371:375>|delicate<395:403>|tasteful<408:416>|plan<420:424>|wrap<438:442>|present<443:451>|ornament<482:490>|hanger<491:498>|ornament hanger<482:498>|decorate<506:514>|card<515:520>|wreath<559:565>",

This is a craft “quality?” ribbon (junk, if I am being polite) that was a waste of money for me. Have never seen low quality ribbon like this so I wasn’t aware that it existed. Not worth the time and money to return. Will be allotted to the junk drawer where it will likely remain forever after.

        "Card making###card<0:4><<<Can be used for various arts and crafts###various<16:23>|art<24:28>|craft<33:39>|||B09XM6ZN1Q ★★★★☆ [2022-09-17] <b>We had a lot of fun threading pony beads onto the green 💚 today</b> These really nice multicolored skinny ribbons can be used for all kinds of arts and crafts. Cards scrapbooking adorning clothing, hats you name it this sky's the limit. I like how the 20 colors of 100 yards of ribbon come in a nice display package with little indentations to keep each roll. That's really neat. I did notice that a couple of my 🌈 rainbow colors had less on the roll than the other rolls had, so I don't know what's up with that but every inch counts. Today my mom and I decided to string some really nice pony beads I'm also testing onto a length of the lime green ribbon. To make sure that the beads would stay on for my mom we knotted one near the bottom of one end of the length that I kind of measured not with tape just kind of put it around my neck and figured out how big I'd want it for it to go over her neck easy. Since we both shake with essential tremor, I wanted to make it easier for her to string the thin ribbon into the big pony bead openings. So I wrapped some Scotch tape around the other end. I wish I could show you that first video I made for you guys. I had it too thick and somehow I also had it the tape on slow motion? So it's really weird but it would take too long to upload I'm sure. Also my mom was joking with me and pulling the tip of the ribbon away so I couldn't stick the little bead on. It was funny you had to be there I guess haha just imagine it. 😜 Anyway, I made the tape narrower and it finally worked perfectly for my mom to string the beads on. It gives her practice with patterning and remembering colors and just hand eye coordination and all those mental gymnastics we need to do to keep our aging brains sharp. Plus she loves jewelry so making her own is even better. It's great how this pack of ribbon gives you so many colors at once without you having to buy 10,000 yards of each. Made in China.###fun<19:22>|pony<33:37>|bead<38:42>|pony bead<33:42>|pony bead<33:43>|bead<38:43>|green<53:58>|today<61:66>|skinny<102:108>|kind<137:141>|kind<137:142>|all kind<133:142>|art<146:150>|craft<155:161>|card<163:168>|scrapbooke<169:181>|adorn<182:190>|thin<194:198>|clothing<191:199>|hat<201:205>|name<210:214>|sky<223:226>|limit<233:238>|100 yard<268:277>|yard<272:277>|display<303:310>|pack<311:315>|package<311:318>|indentation<331:343>|keep<347:351>|roll<357:361>|each roll<352:361>|neat<377:381>|notice<389:395>|a couple<401:409>|couple<403:409>|rainbow<418:425>|rainbow color<418:432>|less<437:441>|roll<449:453>|roll<469:473>|roll<469:474>|every inch<520:530>|inch<526:530>|count<531:537>|today<539:544>|mom<548:551>|decide<558:565>|string<569:575>|pony<593:597>|bead<598:602>|pony bead<593:602>|pony bead<593:603>|bead<598:603>|test<613:620>|length<628:634>|lime<642:646>|green<647:652>|bead<683:687>|bead<683:688>|stay<695:699>|mom<710:713>|knot<717:724>|bottom<738:744>|the bottom<734:744>|end<752:755>|length<763:769>|kind<777:781>|measure<785:793>|tape<803:807>|kind<813:817>|put<821:824>|neck<838:842>|figure<847:854>|big<863:866>|neck<901:905>|essential<937:946>|string<993:999>|thin<1004:1008>|big<1025:1028>|pony<1029:1033>|pony bead<1029:1038>|bead<1034:1038>|opening<1039:1047>|wrap<1054:1061>|tape<1074:1078>|end<1096:1099>|wish<1103:1107>|show<1116:1120>|video<1136:1141>|guy<1157:1161>|thick<1176:1181>|somehow<1186:1193>|tape<1212:1216>|weird<1248:1253>|long<1276:1280>|mom<1309:1312>|joke<1317:1323>|pull<1336:1343>|tip<1348:1351>|away<1366:1370>|stick<1385:1390>|bead<1402:1406>|fun<1418:1421>|funny<1418:1423>|guess<1446:1451>|imagine<1462:1469>|anyway<1476:1482>|tape<1495:1499>|finally<1516:1523>|perfectly<1531:1540>|mom<1548:1551>|string<1555:1561>|bead<1566:1570>|bead<1566:1571>|give<1579:1584>|practice<1589:1597>|pattern<1603:1613>|remember<1618:1629>|hand<1646:1650>|eye<1651:1654>|keep<1717:1721>|sharp<1739:1744>|love<1755:1760>|jewelry<1761:1768>|own<1783:1786>|pack<1823:1827>|pack of ribbon<1823:1837>|give<1838:1843>|once<1866:1870>|yard<1904:1909>|china<1927:1932>"

I will be recommending this Double-Faced Polyester Satin Ribbon to family and friends.###handmade<34:42>|handmade card<34:47>|card<43:47>|double<58:64>|faced<65:70>|double faced<58:70>|double faced polyester<58:80>|faced polyester<65:80>|polyester<71:80>|satin<81:86>|polyester satin<71:86>|handmade<129:137>|card<138:142>|handmade card<129:142>|future<195:201>|box<207:210>|roll<225:229>|20 roll<222:230>|roll<225:230>|roll<247:251>|each roll<242:251>|yard<258:263>|5 yard<256:263>|3/8 inch<275:283>|inch<279:283>|wide<284:288>|beautiful<305:314>|variety<324:331>|card<354:358>|recommend<376:388>|double<394:400>|double faced<394:406>|faced<401:406>|faced polyester<401:416>|double faced polyester<394:416>|polyester<407:416>|satin<417:422>|polyester satin<407:422>|family<433:439>|friend<444:451>"

The velvet seems to be nice and I haven't noticed a problem with fraying. I am looking ahead to Christmas decor where I plan to use this ribbon to replace the unattractive string that often comes on ornaments.

The metallic gold plays off of the burlap very well and I like the wired edges. That said, this does not make a good big fluffy bow with lots of loops. This is a better choice for the clipped bows that use several different ribbons that are cris-crossed and then pulled up. Or a simple one loop bow tied with some string or raffia in the middle. This is a great ribbon for gift wrapping and tying a gift bag. I used some of this at Christmas for some gift bags but I was happy that most of the designs were neutral so I can use them for a relative's 50's anniversary coming up soon.

Especially with Mother's Day around the corner, there's an endless amount of possibilities of what you can do with this ribbon to turn something simple and customize it with your own style. I chose the red ribbon and I've already started wrapping with it. Because of how thin the ribbon is, this would be better for smaller gifts if you'd like to wrap a ribbon around it. Or, you can also tie this to the handle of a bag to make it a little different. Larger gifts might require thicker or wider bows, and therefore this might not be appropriate by itself. It can work as a compliment to a bigger bow. I typically go for ribbons with wires just because they're a little easier to work with when you need the ribbon to conform to a specific angle or shape, but this wasn't difficult to use. The only thing that I would say is that if you typically tape or staple your ribbons sometimes to keep them in place, this isn't the ribbon that's going to cooperate well. Hot glue guns might be better to use when working with this ribbon to get it to form a particular shape or angle. Some examples of craft projects I'm currently working on are using these ribbons on small vases and wrapping of small items for jewelries and handmade bracelets. The feel of the ribbon felt okay. It didn't feel as soft as I expected but more like paper. I would still get this again but in different colors for other DIY projects I'm thinking about.###crafts<13:19>|addition<66:74>|a great addition<58:74>|current<82:89>|craft<90:95>|project<96:104>|craft project<90:104>|especially<122:132>|mother<138:144>|day<147:150>|mother day<138:150>|endless<181:188>|amount<189:195>|tie<208:211>|possibility<199:212>|turn<252:256>|thin<261:265>|simple<267:273>|own<301:304>|style<305:310>|choose<314:319>|red<324:327>|already<344:351>|start<352:359>|wrap<360:364>|wrapping<360:368>|wrap<360:368>|thin<393:397>|small<438:443>|small<438:445>|gift<446:451>|wrap<469:473>|tie<511:514>|handle<527:533>|bag<539:542>|different<563:572>|large<574:580>|gift<581:586>|require<593:600>|thick<601:608>|wide<612:617>|bow<618:621>|bow<618:622>|therefore<628:637>|appropriate<656:667>|compliment<696:706>|big<712:718>|big bow<712:722>|bow<719:722>|a big bow<710:722>|typically<726:735>|wire<756:761>|form<843:847>|specific<853:861>|angle<862:867>|shape<871:876>|difficult<894:903>|thin<921:925>|typically<959:968>|tape<969:973>|staple<977:983>|sometimes<997:1006>|keep<1010:1014>|place<1023:1028>|hot<1084:1087>|hot glue<1084:1092>|glue<1088:1092>|glue gun<1088:1097>|gun<1093:1097>|hot glue gun<1084:1097>|form<1164:1168>|particular<1171:1181>|shape<1182:1187>|angle<1191:1196>|example<1203:1211>|craft<1215:1220>|craft project<1215:1229>|project<1221:1229>|current<1234:1241>|currently<1234:1243>|small<1282:1287>|vase<1288:1293>|wrap<1298:1302>|wrap<1298:1306>|wrapping<1298:1306>|small<1310:1315>|jewelry<1326:1335>|handmade<1340:1348>|bracelet<1349:1358>|feel<1364:1368>|feel<1383:1387>|feel<1404:1408>|soft<1412:1416>|paper<1445:1450>|still<1460:1465>|again<1475:1480>|different<1488:1497>|diy<1515:1518>|project<1519:1527>|diy project<1515:1527>|thin<1532:1536>"

I've taken to just wrapping blankets, sweaters, etc. in a ribbon for the presentation. This ribbon is quite beautiful. I choose a sage green, so that it's neutral on any gift. It's very delicate and the frayed edges look so pretty on packages. The ribbon is about 1.5 inches wide and 5 yards long per spool. (You get 4 spools in the package.) This means I can wrap quite a few packages in this ribbon. at 1.5 inches, I tend to use this for smaller packages, with thinner yarn. it's more of a summer wrap. Because the chiffon is thin, this is very gauzy, so be aware that it's not a robust, satiny ribbon. It's very very delicate. I like it a lot.###delicate<3:11>|gauzy<13:18>|gift<46:50>|gift<46:51>|tend<78:82>|aware<94:99>|packaging<114:123>|put<126:129>|thin<130:134>|become<145:152>|wrap<181:185>|wrap<181:189>|blanket<190:198>|sweater<200:208>|presentation<235:247>|beautiful<270:279>|choose<283:289>|sage<292:296>|green<297:302>|neutral<317:324>|gift<332:336>|delicate<348:356>|fray<365:371>|edge<372:377>|pretty<386:392>|package<396:403>|package<396:404>|inch<430:436>|1.5 inch<426:436>|wide<437:441>|5 yard<446:453>|yard<448:453>|long<454:458>|spool<463:468>|spool<481:486>|spool<481:487>|package<495:502>|mean<510:515>|wrap<522:526>|package<539:546>|package<539:547>|1.5 inch<567:577>|inch<571:577>|tend<581:585>|small<602:609>|package<610:617>|package<610:618>|small package<602:618>|thin<625:629>|thin<625:632>|yarn<633:637>|summer<654:660>|wrap<661:665>|chiffon<679:686>|thin<690:694>|gauzy<709:714>|aware<722:727>|satiny<752:758>|delicate<782:790>"

The ribbon width looks lovely on packages and the length of each piece is sufficient for a single box. I was a little bit surprised to discover that these do not come on spools like I'd expected. Some come all squished together in a bag, and others are tied and put in a bag. It's not a huge deal, since I just hung them on a doorknob for a few days to get any wrinkles out and they were fine (you can iron them too). It's also nice that it cuts down on waste and I don't have to throw out all those cardboard cores.

I don’t need to pin it down while I’m making folds with my toes anymore! And can make a bow using two or three different kinds of ribbon with ease. I didn’t watch the included DVD yet, as I’ve seen these used on YouTube and it’s sort of easy to figure out -but I’d suggest watching it anyway. I could be doing it wrong:). First you put a chenille wire (or any type you prefer) into the groove. This contraption basically just pinches the ribbon while you make the folds. Then after you work your magic, just pull it out by your wire and twist. This is SO much faster than by hand, it is totally worth it. I designed a second holiday wreath just so I could use this more and will be making up reasons to give gifts to wrap all year.

It's perfect! I'm using it for bridal bouquets. I read some of the reviews saying the color comes off but those are wrong! The color did not come off at all while working with it and even after soaking some in warm water it did not bleed. Plus it dried beautifully. No wrinkling or fraying. It has a nice sheen and weight with finished edges.

I'll update with more information as I use it, but for 100 yards, this is a reasonable value that includes the cost of shipping.

I mean it's so useful! Replacing drawstrings or shoe laces (use a lighter to seal end so they dont fray), so cute in hair, gift wrapping.. probably some other things. For me at least it's essential lol. The width of this is perfect for little hair bows, which is what I ordered for. I removed a star based on the length. One spool is only 25yards, but the listing claims it's 50 yards. Maybe I was supposed to receive 2 boxes/spools? I'm not sure. The price point is reasonable for 50y, but overpriced for only 25y...

It is perfect to put on greeting cards that I make and I love that it is almost the exact shade of Stampin Up’s garden green. With 25 yards on the role it is unlikely that I will ever use at all so I have shared with some of my crafty friends. I think this would also make a great trim to a child’s dress or a garment. This would be perfect for any holiday ornaments that you’re making or samplers. The price cannot be beat, and I would purchase this again in a heartbeat.###beautiful<3:12>|absolutely<42:52>|love<53:57>|velvet<63:69>|put<95:98>|greeting<102:110>|greeting card<102:116>|card<111:116>|love<135:139>|almost<151:157>|exact<162:167>|shade<168:173>|garden<190:196>|green<197:202>|25 yard<209:217>|yard<212:217>|role<225:229>|unlikely<236:244>|ever<257:261>|all<269:272>|crafty<306:312>|friend<313:320>|trim<359:363>|child<369:374>|dress<377:382>|garment<388:395>|any holiday<423:434>|holiday<427:434>|ornament<435:444>|holiday ornament<427:444>|beat<497:501>|again<529:534>|beat<545:549>",

VALUE: If this ribbon was going to the trash with wrapping paper, $4.99 for 100 yards is a good value. I’m giving the supplier credit that there actually are 100 yards on the roll. Unfortunately I bought this ribbon to serve as page markers for a Bible rebind. So, this ribbon is just too cheap looking and flimsy for that use. Value for me is zero. QUALITY: mediocre to poor, extremely thin material with almost invisible edge detail. PACKAGING: Unlike ribbon sold at brick and mortar stores, this roll came rolled around a core and in a cellophane envelope, but with no chip board sides to prevent the entire roll from falling off the sides of the core and totally tangling. PRODUCT LISTENING: Sold as Dark Red Double Faced Color is subjective but this roll of Dk Red appears to this purchaser to be closer to Light Red Wine in color. With a decidedly different texture on the reverse side, it is highly doubtful that this can be considered “Double Faced”. SUMMARY: If you are looking for ribbon for decoration, say for hair ribbons or seasonal decor, or for more permanent items like sewing into a dress or to make book markers, look elsewhere. If you only want to tie up a quick gift, or need wine colored string, go for it.###extremely<3:12>|thin<13:17>|double<26:32>|double faced<26:38>|faced<33:38>|pay<84:87>|kinda<94:99>|trash<140:145>|wrapping<151:159>|paper<160:165>|wrapping paper<151:165>|100 yard<177:186>|yard<181:186>|give<208:214>|supplier<219:227>|actually<246:254>|yard<263:268>|100 yard<259:268>|roll<276:280>|unfortunately<282:295>|serve<320:325>|page<329:333>|marker<334:341>|bible<348:353>|cheap<390:395>|looking<396:403>|cheap looking<390:403>|flimsy<408:414>|extremely<478:487>|thin<488:492>|material<493:501>|thin material<488:501>|almost<507:513>|edge<524:528>|detail<529:535>|packaging<537:546>|sell<562:566>|store<587:593>|roll<600:604>|roll<610:614>|roll<610:616>|core<626:630>|cellophane<640:650>|envelope<651:659>|board<678:683>|side<684:688>|side<684:689>|prevent<693:700>|entire<705:711>|roll<712:716>|the entire roll<701:716>|entire roll<705:716>|fall<722:729>|side<738:742>|side<738:743>|core<751:755>|totally<760:767>|tangle<768:776>|sell<797:801>|dark<805:809>|red<810:813>|dark red<805:813>|double<814:820>|faced<821:826>|double faced<814:826>|roll<856:860>|dk<864:866>|red<867:870>|appear<871:878>|close<903:909>|light<913:918>|red<919:922>|wine<923:927>|red wine<919:927>|different<955:964>|texture<965:972>|reverse<980:987>|side<988:992>|highly<1000:1006>|side<1036:1040>|consider<1033:1043>|double<1045:1051>|double faced<1045:1057>|faced<1052:1057>|looking<1080:1087>|decor<1103:1108>|decoration<1103:1113>|hair<1123:1127>|seasonal<1139:1147>|decor<1148:1153>|permanent<1167:1176>|sew<1188:1194>|dress<1202:1207>|book<1219:1223>|marker<1224:1231>|elsewhere<1238:1247>|tie<1269:1272>|gift<1284:1288>|wine<1298:1302>|colored<1303:1310>|string<1311:1317>"

I actually expected the cheaper, stiffer, almost papery ribbon like some of the cheaper ribbons at the craftstore but this is a silky poly ribbon, soft and flexible, and double sided. It conforms to any shape you need with creasing or bending or flattening. I use it to make teeny tiny bows to put at the top of my toy poodles ears when grooming her (I make the bows on a hemostat with a tiny rubber band then slide it from the hemostat onto a few twisted strands of my pup's fur) and it's perfect for that but I also look forward to making some ornaments this year with bows and loops at the top made from this ribbon. The possibilities are endless really, this is a just a great array of colored ribbons and you'll find lots if uses for it.

I have quite a few chiffon ribbons but those are more sheer than this material. The spool looks to be a standard thread spool size. I stock ribbons for several reasons. I do wedding photography and use the ribbons when styling a lay flat which is usually of the wedding couples’ details. Ya, brides don’t provide those things so we bring them lol. I also photograph newborns and milestones and these ribbons would really well for tiebacks and headbands that we make custom for our client closets. I love creating delicate outfits and accessories for my sweet little babies. The color is definitely a chocolate shade of champagne but very pretty. One side has shine and the other is matte so versatile as well.###lovely<3:9>|soft<20:24>|texture<25:32>|satin<42:47>|love<58:62>|lovely<58:64>|beautiful<71:80>|feel<91:95>|chiffon<116:123>|sheer<151:156>|material<167:175>|spool<181:186>|standard<201:209>|thread<210:216>|spool<217:222>|size<223:227>|stock<231:236>|reason<257:264>|wedding<271:278>|photography<279:290>|style<316:323>|lay<326:329>|lay flat<326:334>|flat<330:334>|usually<344:351>|wedding<359:366>|couple<367:374>|detail<376:383>|bride<389:395>|provide<402:409>|bring<429:434>|lol<440:443>|newborn<463:471>|tieback<527:535>|headband<540:549>|custom<563:569>|client<578:584>|love<596:600>|create<601:609>|delicate<610:618>|outfit<619:626>|accessory<631:642>|sweet<650:655>|baby<663:669>|definitely<684:694>|chocolate<697:706>|shade<707:712>|champagne<716:725>|pretty<735:741>|side<747:751>|one side<743:751>|shine<756:761>|matte<779:784>|versatile<788:797>",

I mean it's so useful! Replacing drawstrings or shoe laces (use a lighter to seal end so they dont fray), so cute in hair, gift wrapping.. probably some other things. For me at least it's essential lol. The width of this is perfect for little hair bows, which is what I ordered for. I removed a star based on the length. One spool is only 25yards, but the listing claims it's 50 yards. Maybe I was supposed to receive 2 boxes/spools? I'm not sure. The price point is reasonable for 50y, but overpriced for only 25y...

I bought it for braiding into my hair and tying it up. Velvet and wired ribbons do not work for this and satin is the least damaging. It does fray on the ends but I use old school glue to stop that. A knot might work too. It came wrapped around a foam disc and does not hold any curved shape. Color is as expected from the photos. I want to try 3/4th next and maybe a less pale/more saturated color.###satin<3:8>|inch<23:27>|1 cm<31:34>|cm<32:34>|braid<82:90>|hair<99:103>|tie<108:113>|velvet<121:127>|wire<132:137>|satin<171:176>|least<184:189>|fray<208:212>|end<220:224>|school<239:245>|glue<246:250>|stop<254:258>|knot<267:271>|wrap<296:303>|foam<313:317>|hold<336:340>|shape<352:357>|photo<389:395>|less<434:438>|pale<439:443>|saturated<449:458>|saturated color<449:464>"

And it is so versatile I can hardly wait to make bows to include on gifts, for children's hair, and even decorations. The Bow-dabra comes with an instruction book which is great but the creators went the extra mile and included a DVD to demonstrate just what you can do with it. VERY nice. The DVD is divided into sections so you can go right to the type of bow you want to make. Or, you can watch the entire thing all the way through which I did. You can make tiny bows for hair, decorative bows for packages, bows that include foil decorations, berries, flowers, or anything you can think of to include in the bow. They even demonstrate how to use up old scraps of ribbon to make a gorgeous bow. And these bows can get massive! You just have to see it after purchasing the Bow-dabra. I am planning a Bow-dabra party for my friends, to show them what all it will do. Summer is a great time to start thinking about Christmas decorations and gift wrapping so it would be fun to let each guest make a bow of their choosing. The guests can either bring their own ribbon and decorations or I could provide those. Either way, it's more fun if you do it yourself and have something to show. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that each bow you make uses a gold wire that is conveniently included in the Bow-dabra box. There is enough for about 10 bows. Do you can get the hang of it before buying more wire. The wire is only used to hold the bow together, so you could probably find some other colors. But I love the gold. It adds elegance to every bow. This is the cutest and most useful craft item I have seen in a long time. You just have to get one and try it for yourself.

However the vine is thin. I was hoping for a much more thicker approach. I should of researched the product better. This is thin and can be used for balloons or maybe an art project in a scrapbook or photo album, maybe a head piece for a holloween. This will not hold up as decorations or a banner (which is what I'm looking for). I'll use it as the string for our balloons and try and buy something else to edge the ceiling for the party. Technically it is as advertised. Just thin. I gave it 4 stars because if u use it for other ideas it will work great.

I noticed that it has a tendency to fray where it's cut, leaving behind velvet \"snow\" which makes a mess. I found that if you put a drop of glue on the cut end as soon as you cut it, it will keep it from fraying as badly. But that sounds like a serious pain for someone who it wrapping presents. But for jewelry and other crafts, it's great.###probably<5:13>|gift<36:40>|wrapping<41:49>|gift wrapping<36:49>|wrap<41:49>|choker<74:81>|turn<92:98>|cut<110:113>|cute<110:114>|notice<118:125>|end<141:144>|tendency<140:148>|fray<152:156>|cut<168:171>|leave<173:180>|velvet<188:194>|snow<196:200>|a mess<214:220>|mess<216:220>|find<224:229>|put<242:245>|drop<248:252>|glue<256:260>|cut<268:271>|end<272:275>|the cut end<264:275>|cut end<268:275>|soon<279:283>|cut<291:294>|keep<307:311>|fray<320:324>|fray<320:327>|badly<331:336>|sound<347:353>|pain<369:373>|wrap<393:401>|wrapping<393:401>|present<402:410>|jewelry<420:427>|craft<438:444>"

The first is my fault: I really didn't do the math well when I ordered this, and I just didn't realize how short a length I would get off each color. Some of these colors are gorgeous, but others I know I'm unlikely to use again. That tends to mean the colors I don't like will pile up, if I try to re-purchase more of the ones I do like - and that will happen quickly, with only 1 yard of each color. I really, really hate the way these were packed. The product picture shows each color rolled separately, but that's not what you get. Instead, you get about a half-dozen large rolls, which contain multiple colors. Without unrolling each one, it's impossible to see what's there. Because of this before I could even use the ribbon, I spent an hour and a half unrolling the big rolls and making small, individual rolls with each color. After that, I can see and access them all easily. But honestly, I really had much better things to do with my time than repack 30 yards of ribbon. The quality isn't bad. I had hoped for thicker ribbon, as I planned to use these to make necklaces and I want them to last. A thicker pile to the ribbon would prevent it from wrinkling too easily, and would keep it from looking prematurely worn. Anything I make from these, I will have to charge a bit less for and warn customers that the necklace cord will eventually wear out. What I do like: many of these colors are stunning. It is nice to have a sampler to allow me to figure out what I need most. I really hope that they hold up better than I am expecting. Time will tell. If all you need is ribbons for trim, or to hang ornaments from, these are a good choice. I think, however, they for my purposes, I am going to have to keep looking for higher quality.###couple<16:22>|a couple<14:22>|issue<26:32>|hang<105:109>|disappoint<133:145>|re<158:160>|reason<158:165>|fault<183:188>|re<192:194>|the math<209:217>|math<213:217>|re<234:236>|re<262:264>|realize<262:269>|short<274:279>|length<282:288>|re<339:341>|gorgeous<342:350>|unlikely<374:382>|again<390:395>|tend<402:407>|mean<411:415>|pile<445:449>|re<466:468>|re<480:482>|one<490:493>|one<490:494>|happen<521:527>|quickly<528:535>|1 yard<547:553>|yard<549:553>|re<571:573>|re<579:581>|hate<586:590>|re<607:609>|pack<610:616>|re<635:637>|picture<630:637>|show<638:643>|roll<655:661>|instead<703:710>|half<728:732>|large<739:744>|roll<745:750>|large roll<739:750>|contain<758:765>|multiple<766:774>|unroll<791:800>|one<806:809>|impossible<816:826>|re<844:846>|re<868:870>|spend<902:907>|an hour<908:915>|hour<911:915>|half<922:926>|unroll<927:936>|big<941:944>|roll<945:950>|big roll<941:950>|small<962:967>|individual<969:979>|roll<980:985>|individual roll<969:985>|access<1029:1035>|easily<1045:1051>|one<1058:1061>|one<1058:1062>|honestly<1057:1065>|re<1069:1071>|re<1123:1125>|yard<1133:1137>|yard<1133:1138>|30 yard<1130:1138>|hope<1179:1183>|hope<1179:1184>|thick<1189:1196>|plan<1210:1217>|necklace<1239:1247>|necklace<1239:1248>|thick<1276:1283>|pile<1284:1288>|re<1310:1312>|prevent<1309:1316>|wrinkle<1325:1334>|easily<1339:1345>|keep<1357:1361>|re<1379:1381>|re<1385:1387>|worn<1390:1394>|charge<1439:1445>|less<1452:1456>|warn<1465:1469>|customer<1470:1479>|necklace<1489:1497>|cord<1498:1502>|eventually<1508:1518>|wear<1519:1523>|re<1567:1569>|stunning<1570:1578>|allow<1612:1617>|re<1628:1630>|figure<1624:1630>|most<1647:1651>|re<1655:1657>|hope<1662:1666>|hold<1677:1681>|trim<1760:1764>|hang<1772:1776>|ornament<1777:1786>|re<1800:1802>|choice<1810:1816>|however<1827:1834>|purpose<1848:1856>|keep<1880:1884>|high<1897:1903>|high quality<1897:1911>"

        "Making jewelry###jewelry<7:14><<<Can be threaded with pony beads###thread<7:15>|pony<21:25>|pony bead<21:31>|bead<26:31>|||B09XM6ZN1Q ★★★★☆ [2022-09-17] <b>We had a lot of fun threading pony beads onto the green 💚 today</b> These really nice multicolored skinny ribbons can be used for all kinds of arts and crafts. Cards scrapbooking adorning clothing, hats you name it this sky's the limit. I like how the 20 colors of 100 yards of ribbon come in a nice display package with little indentations to keep each roll. That's really neat. I did notice that a couple of my 🌈 rainbow colors had less on the roll than the other rolls had, so I don't know what's up with that but every inch counts. Today my mom and I decided to string some really nice pony beads I'm also testing onto a length of the lime green ribbon. To make sure that the beads would stay on for my mom we knotted one near the bottom of one end of the length that I kind of measured not with tape just kind of put it around my neck and figured out how big I'd want it for it to go over her neck easy. Since we both shake with essential tremor, I wanted to make it easier for her to string the thin ribbon into the big pony bead openings. So I wrapped some Scotch tape around the other end. I wish I could show you that first video I made for you guys. I had it too thick and somehow I also had it the tape on slow motion? So it's really weird but it would take too long to upload I'm sure. Also my mom was joking with me and pulling the tip of the ribbon away so I couldn't stick the little bead on. It was funny you had to be there I guess haha just imagine it. 😜 Anyway, I made the tape narrower and it finally worked perfectly for my mom to string the beads on. It gives her practice with patterning and remembering colors and just hand eye coordination and all those mental gymnastics we need to do to keep our aging brains sharp. Plus she loves jewelry so making her own is even better. It's great how this pack of ribbon gives you so many colors at once without you having to buy 10,000 yards of each. Made in China.###fun<19:22>|pony<33:37>|bead<38:42>|pony bead<33:42>|pony bead<33:43>|bead<38:43>|green<53:58>|today<61:66>|skinny<102:108>|kind<137:141>|kind<137:142>|all kind<133:142>|art<146:150>|craft<155:161>|card<163:168>|scrapbooke<169:181>|adorn<182:190>|thin<194:198>|clothing<191:199>|hat<201:205>|name<210:214>|sky<223:226>|limit<233:238>|100 yard<268:277>|yard<272:277>|display<303:310>|pack<311:315>|package<311:318>|indentation<331:343>|keep<347:351>|roll<357:361>|each roll<352:361>|neat<377:381>|notice<389:395>|a couple<401:409>|couple<403:409>|rainbow<418:425>|rainbow color<418:432>|less<437:441>|roll<449:453>|roll<469:473>|roll<469:474>|every inch<520:530>|inch<526:530>|count<531:537>|today<539:544>|mom<548:551>|decide<558:565>|string<569:575>|pony<593:597>|bead<598:602>|pony bead<593:602>|pony bead<593:603>|bead<598:603>|test<613:620>|length<628:634>|lime<642:646>|green<647:652>|bead<683:687>|bead<683:688>|stay<695:699>|mom<710:713>|knot<717:724>|bottom<738:744>|the bottom<734:744>|end<752:755>|length<763:769>|kind<777:781>|measure<785:793>|tape<803:807>|kind<813:817>|put<821:824>|neck<838:842>|figure<847:854>|big<863:866>|neck<901:905>|essential<937:946>|string<993:999>|thin<1004:1008>|big<1025:1028>|pony<1029:1033>|pony bead<1029:1038>|bead<1034:1038>|opening<1039:1047>|wrap<1054:1061>|tape<1074:1078>|end<1096:1099>|wish<1103:1107>|show<1116:1120>|video<1136:1141>|guy<1157:1161>|thick<1176:1181>|somehow<1186:1193>|tape<1212:1216>|weird<1248:1253>|long<1276:1280>|mom<1309:1312>|joke<1317:1323>|pull<1336:1343>|tip<1348:1351>|away<1366:1370>|stick<1385:1390>|bead<1402:1406>|fun<1418:1421>|funny<1418:1423>|guess<1446:1451>|imagine<1462:1469>|anyway<1476:1482>|tape<1495:1499>|finally<1516:1523>|perfectly<1531:1540>|mom<1548:1551>|string<1555:1561>|bead<1566:1570>|bead<1566:1571>|give<1579:1584>|practice<1589:1597>|pattern<1603:1613>|remember<1618:1629>|hand<1646:1650>|eye<1651:1654>|keep<1717:1721>|sharp<1739:1744>|love<1755:1760>|jewelry<1761:1768>|own<1783:1786>|pack<1823:1827>|pack of ribbon<1823:1837>|give<1838:1843>|once<1866:1870>|yard<1904:1909>|china<1927:1932>"

I could clearly see the lighter ribbon underneath but must’ve been from heating the material because it’s been drying awhile now and appears back to all black. The spool read “washing fastness test” so perhaps it is color fast. I’ll have to wash some by hand to test before I use though. Update: I had goofed before when I wrote the above review. I had looked at the wrong place on the spool and thought the iron had only temporarily made a color change with the heat but in fact I found the place where I hit it with an iron and the dye is indeed gone. I’ve been shrinking ribbons for years by wetting and pressing and it’s never happened before. It’ll be a lovely ribbon for projects that won’t be laundered but I wouldn’t trust it to be color fast during laundering. I have not done a laundering color fastness test though.###high<9:13>|high quality<9:21>|test<36:40>|fastness<51:59>|color fastness<45:59>|high<70:74>|high quality<70:82>|black<83:88>|appear<97:105>|dye<118:121>|wet<138:141>|iron<153:157>|iron<153:160>|case<167:171>|part<203:207>|project<214:221>|clearly<245:252>|light<261:268>|underneath<276:286>|heat<309:313>|heat<309:316>|material<321:329>|dry<348:354>|now<362:365>|appear<370:377>|back<378:382>|black<390:395>|spool<401:406>|read<407:411>|wash<413:417>|wash<413:420>|fastness<421:429>|test<430:434>|perhaps<439:446>|wash<478:482>|hand<491:495>|test<499:503>|though<517:523>|update<525:531>|write<560:565>|place<610:615>|spool<623:628>|though<633:639>|iron<645:649>|change<684:690>|heat<700:704>|fact<712:716>|find<719:724>|place<729:734>|hit<743:746>|iron<758:762>|dye<771:774>|indeed<778:784>|year<823:828>|wet<832:835>|wet<832:839>|press<844:852>|never<862:867>|happen<868:876>|lovely<896:902>|project<914:921>|project<914:922>|trust<962:967>|color fastness<1036:1050>|fastness<1042:1050>|test<1051:1055>|though<1056:1062>"

She is using a sage green color palette and this ribbon is beautiful for that. The edges have a worn raveled type looks on the edges. The cloth itself is like a gauze cheesecloth type of material. It comes with three rolls of ribbon with each roll having 7 yards on it. Rolls are 1 inch wide, one and a half inches wide and 2 inches wide. I like that they are varying widths, so they can be used for different purposes. Everything feels strong, and like it will hold up well. It forms a bow easily because of the texture of the ribbon.

It has the most popular Christmas elements, the red truck, snowman, Santa, snowflakes and the traditional red and black gingham. They mix and match just wonderfully! They are not thin by any means and really have a nice weight and quality. Not sheer at all. The prints are only on one side (except the red and black gingham, that is the same on both sides) and that is not a problem at all as most ribbon is that way, just wanted to mention that. Perfect for your farmhouse creations. Timeless prints too! The wire is nice and sturdy. Colors are vibrant. Perfect for the finishing touches on Christmas gifts, wreaths, centerpieces, scrapbooking and more!

I saw this beautiful idea on Pinterest (of course) and I tried it. It's the trend where you wrap your front door to look like a present (1 band horizonatally, 1 band vertically and then put a bow at the intersection). Pretty easy to do and this material was perfect for the harsh outside weather. It has a velvety feel which makes it look expensive. After 2.5 months outside, it didn't lose even a bit of its color, and I kept the ribbon to reattempt the next year as well. For my standard-sized door, 1 of these was enough, although I only wrapped the front side to save on the material. Hope this helps :)###beautiful<3:12>|door<22:26>|gift<27:31>|wrap<32:36>|overall<41:48>|beautiful<69:78>|idea<79:83>|pinterest<87:96>|course<101:107>|trend<134:139>|wrap<150:154>|front<160:165>|door<166:170>|front door<160:170>|present<186:193>|band<197:201>|band<219:223>|put<244:247>|bow<250:253>|pretty<276:282>|material<303:311>|side<341:345>|weather<346:353>|velvety<364:371>|feel<372:376>|velvety feel<364:376>|expensive<397:406>|month<418:424>|side<428:432>|lose<444:448>|keep<480:484>|year<518:522>|next year<513:522>|standard<539:547>|sized<548:553>|door<554:558>|wrap<599:603>|wrap<599:606>|front<611:616>|side<617:621>|front side<611:621>|save<625:629>|material<637:645>|hope<647:651>|help<657:662>"

I also am able to help out friends that also need sewing supplies. I appreciate the opportunity to try this ribbon out.

She asked me to order a pale blue satin, and gave me the size she needed, and this is one of the few I found within budget. It's been sewn on and looks great. Somehow, the light blue color went nicely with the medium blue blanket (I was afraid it might clash).

I am able to use this with my sewing machine, and while it was really difficult to fold and iron flat- it doesn't hold a crease very well and I couldn't get it to fold straight- it held up fabulously under my sewing machine. The satin is soft and pliable, not plastic feeling, and it didn't melt from the iron, even on the hottest setting. I'm using it as a hem for a rainbow petticoat, so I won't be washing it, but I think it would be okay to send through the washer and dryer, since it didn't melt from the iron. The colors are very vibrant and true to the picture.###realize<23:30>|realize<23:31>|update<36:43>|5 yard<97:104>|yard<99:104>|total<122:127>|30 yard<131:139>|yard<134:139>|hour<154:158>|an hour<151:158>|realize<172:179>|yard<238:243>|able<250:254>|sewing<275:281>|machine<282:289>|sewing machine<275:289>|difficult<315:324>|fold<328:332>|iron<337:341>|hold<359:363>|crease<366:372>|fold<408:412>|hold<426:430>|sewing<454:460>|sewing machine<454:468>|machine<461:468>|satin<474:479>|soft<483:487>|able<495:499>|pliable<492:499>|plastic<505:512>|plastic feeling<505:520>|feeling<513:520>|melt<536:540>|iron<550:554>|hot<568:575>|setting<576:583>|hem<603:606>|rainbow<613:620>|wash<646:653>|send<690:694>|dryer<718:723>|melt<741:745>|iron<755:759>|vibrant<781:788>|picture<805:812>"

It isn't the best quality, nor is it the worst, and it could easily be used to embellish clothing, doll clothes, hair decorations, a variety of crafts, scrapbooking, etc. I think it's a good value for the quantity.###assortment<14:24>|assortment<44:54>|spool<61:67>|double<71:77>|face<78:83>|satin<84:89>|hobby<136:141>|useful<168:174>|decorate<178:186>|various<187:194>|various project<187:203>|project<195:203>|bright<223:229>|bright pink<223:234>|pink<230:234>|unlikely<239:247>|ever<248:252>|duplicate<267:276>|set<294:297>|handy<311:316>|forward<323:330>|easily<393:399>|embellish<411:420>|clothing<421:429>|doll<431:435>|clothe<436:443>|hair<445:449>|decoration<450:461>|hair decoration<445:461>|variety<465:472>|craft<476:482>|scrapbooking<484:496>|quantity<537:545>"

I am able to use this with my sewing machine, and while it was really difficult to fold and iron flat- it doesn't hold a crease very well and I couldn't get it to fold straight- it held up fabulously under my sewing machine. The satin is soft and pliable, not plastic feeling, and it didn't melt from the iron, even on the hottest setting. I'm using it as a hem for a rainbow petticoat, so I won't be washing it, but I think it would be okay to send through the washer and dryer, since it didn't melt from the iron. The colors are very vibrant and true to the picture.###realize<23:30>|realize<23:31>|update<36:43>|5 yard<97:104>|yard<99:104>|total<122:127>|30 yard<131:139>|yard<134:139>|hour<154:158>|an hour<151:158>|realize<172:179>|yard<238:243>|able<250:254>|sewing<275:281>|machine<282:289>|sewing machine<275:289>|difficult<315:324>|fold<328:332>|iron<337:341>|hold<359:363>|crease<366:372>|fold<408:412>|hold<426:430>|sewing<454:460>|sewing machine<454:468>|machine<461:468>|satin<474:479>|soft<483:487>|able<495:499>|pliable<492:499>|plastic<505:512>|plastic feeling<505:520>|feeling<513:520>|melt<536:540>|iron<550:554>|hot<568:575>|setting<576:583>|hem<603:606>|rainbow<613:620>|wash<646:653>|send<690:694>|dryer<718:723>|melt<741:745>|iron<755:759>|vibrant<781:788>|picture<805:812>",
        "trim###trim<0:4>|||B09MBZC8Q8 ★★★☆☆ [2020-09-26] <b>Nice, with a couple of issues.</b> This ribbon looks nice enough if you just need something to use to hang thinga with, but I was disappointed for several reasons. The first is my fault: I really didn't do the math well when I ordered this, and I just didn't realize how short a length I would get off each color. Some of these colors are gorgeous, but others I know I'm unlikely to use again. That tends to mean the colors I don't like will pile up, if I try to re-purchase more of the ones I do like - and that will happen quickly, with only 1 yard of each color. I really, really hate the way these were packed. The product picture shows each color rolled separately, but that's not what you get. Instead, you get about a half-dozen large rolls, which contain multiple colors. Without unrolling each one, it's impossible to see what's there. Because of this before I could even use the ribbon, I spent an hour and a half unrolling the big rolls and making small, individual rolls with each color. After that, I can see and access them all easily. But honestly, I really had much better things to do with my time than repack 30 yards of ribbon. The quality isn't bad. I had hoped for thicker ribbon, as I planned to use these to make necklaces and I want them to last. A thicker pile to the ribbon would prevent it from wrinkling too easily, and would keep it from looking prematurely worn. Anything I make from these, I will have to charge a bit less for and warn customers that the necklace cord will eventually wear out. What I do like: many of these colors are stunning. It is nice to have a sampler to allow me to figure out what I need most. I really hope that they hold up better than I am expecting. Time will tell. If all you need is ribbons for trim, or to hang ornaments from, these are a good choice. I think, however, they for my purposes, I am going to have to keep looking for higher quality.###couple<16:22>|a couple<14:22>|issue<26:32>|hang<105:109>|disappoint<133:145>|re<158:160>|reason<158:165>|fault<183:188>|re<192:194>|the math<209:217>|math<213:217>|re<234:236>|re<262:264>|realize<262:269>|short<274:279>|length<282:288>|re<339:341>|gorgeous<342:350>|unlikely<374:382>|again<390:395>|tend<402:407>|mean<411:415>|pile<445:449>|re<466:468>|re<480:482>|one<490:493>|one<490:494>|happen<521:527>|quickly<528:535>|1 yard<547:553>|yard<549:553>|re<571:573>|re<579:581>|hate<586:590>|re<607:609>|pack<610:616>|re<635:637>|picture<630:637>|show<638:643>|roll<655:661>|instead<703:710>|half<728:732>|large<739:744>|roll<745:750>|large roll<739:750>|contain<758:765>|multiple<766:774>|unroll<791:800>|one<806:809>|impossible<816:826>|re<844:846>|re<868:870>|spend<902:907>|an hour<908:915>|hour<911:915>|half<922:926>|unroll<927:936>|big<941:944>|roll<945:950>|big roll<941:950>|small<962:967>|individual<969:979>|roll<980:985>|individual roll<969:985>|access<1029:1035>|easily<1045:1051>|one<1058:1061>|one<1058:1062>|honestly<1057:1065>|re<1069:1071>|re<1123:1125>|yard<1133:1137>|yard<1133:1138>|30 yard<1130:1138>|hope<1179:1183>|hope<1179:1184>|thick<1189:1196>|plan<1210:1217>|necklace<1239:1247>|necklace<1239:1248>|thick<1276:1283>|pile<1284:1288>|re<1310:1312>|prevent<1309:1316>|wrinkle<1325:1334>|easily<1339:1345>|keep<1357:1361>|re<1379:1381>|re<1385:1387>|worn<1390:1394>|charge<1439:1445>|less<1452:1456>|warn<1465:1469>|customer<1470:1479>|necklace<1489:1497>|cord<1498:1502>|eventually<1508:1518>|wear<1519:1523>|re<1567:1569>|stunning<1570:1578>|allow<1612:1617>|re<1628:1630>|figure<1624:1630>|most<1647:1651>|re<1655:1657>|hope<1662:1666>|hold<1677:1681>|trim<1760:1764>|hang<1772:1776>|ornament<1777:1786>|re<1800:1802>|choice<1810:1816>|however<1827:1834>|purpose<1848:1856>|keep<1880:1884>|high<1897:1903>|high quality<1897:1911>",

It is an affordable choice for sewing compared to Offray or Mokuba but won't give the rich luxurious folds that a better-quality ribbon will support. It is has a thinner hand than Offray with a somewhat paper-like quality and lacks the luster of the more expensive ribbons. Still, though, it has a very pleasing sheen and is an excellent choice for beautiful wrapping and crafts. One note: The sage color I purchased was a gray green. In fact, when I first opened it I thought I’d received gray. I’ve taken a picture of it against white notebook paper and a US $10 bill to help judge color.

Bows are very trendy again, and I've seen them used in Christmas decorating blogs and magazines. I'm looking forward to using this beautiful ribbon in my decorating!###beautiful<3:12>|camel<13:18>|camel color<13:24>|camel color<13:26>|velvet<27:33>|thin<50:54>|velvet<56:62>|camel<85:90>|camel color<85:96>|beautiful<104:113>|beautifully<104:115>|present<116:125>|wooden<129:135>|spool<136:142>|wooden spool<129:142>|presentation<148:160>|vintage<175:182>|tight<207:212>|bow<213:217>|trim<250:254>|sewing<260:266>|a sewing project<258:274>|project<267:274>|sewing project<260:274>|plan<283:287>|tiny<306:310>|bow<311:315>|christmas<323:332>|tree<333:338>|christmas tree<323:338>|bow<340:344>|christmas tree bow<323:344>|again<361:366>|christmas<395:404>|decorate<405:415>|decorating<405:415>|forward<449:456>|beautiful<471:480>|decorate<494:504>|decorating<494:504>",

Instead it was all wadded up in a cheap plastic bag (see photo). I thought, “Did I really order this?” When I went back to check, sure enough, the description said, “10 Yards Velvet Ribbon Spool...” It’s pretty, and is the color I wanted, a light turquoise. The quality seems just OK, nothing special. I got it for use on hand-sewed upcycled clothing projects, so time will tell, as will the number of washings. Maybe if the presentation was a little closer to the description, meaning, had it actually arrived on a spool, the initial perceived quality might be a tad higher. The lack of spool was so annoying that I was almost ready to return it. Then I discovered that the piece was actually 10 yards and 18 inches. So maybe they were aware of the spool thing and duked me some extra, which I appreciate. And the price was certainly in the right ballpark, so I’m keeping it.###surprised<33:42>|open<46:50>|spool<75:80>|instead<82:89>|wad<101:107>|cheap<116:121>|plastic<122:129>|plastic bag<122:133>|bag<130:133>|photo<139:144>|back<197:201>|check<205:210>|description<229:240>|yards<251:256>|velvet<257:263>|spool<271:276>|pretty<286:292>|light<323:328>|turquoise<329:338>|special<375:382>|hand<404:408>|sew<409:414>|clothing<424:432>|clothing project<424:441>|project<433:441>|number<474:480>|washing<484:492>|presentation<507:519>|close<533:539>|description<547:558>|actually<576:584>|arrive<585:592>|spool<598:603>|initial<609:616>|tad<646:649>|a tad<644:649>|high<650:656>|lack<662:666>|spool<670:675>|annoying<683:691>|almost<703:709>|ready<710:715>|return<719:725>|discover<737:747>|piece<757:762>|actually<767:775>|10 yard<776:784>|yard<779:784>|inch<792:798>|18 inch<789:798>|aware<819:824>|spool<832:837>|extra<862:867>|appreciate<877:887>|certainly<907:916>|keep<947:954>",

Ferner handelt es sich um ein stabiles, dickes Band, welches man sehr gut mit dem Bügeleisen zum Wiederbenutzen glätten kann, wenn man vorher einen festen Knoten gemacht hat. Da es als Rolle geliefert wurde, war es nicht zerknittert. Einen chemischen Geruch konnte ich ebenfalls nicht feststellen.

She asked me to order a pale blue satin, and gave me the size she needed, and this is one of the few I found within budget. It's been sewn on and looks great. Somehow, the light blue color went nicely with the medium blue blanket (I was afraid it might clash).

The pink color is accurately represented, and the plush face of the ribbon looks really nice. The downside is the same with any velvet ribbon -- it's inherently challenging to work with for tying bows. That is true with every velvet ribbon I've ever had, so I do not consider that a flaw in the product. That's just the nature of velvet. If you've never worked with velvet ribbon before, just know that part going in. I am not using this ribbon for sewing, but having handled it and examined it, I do think that it would be appropriate for a sewing project. The material is on the heavier side, it doesn't have a wired edge, and it doesn't seem to fray too badly. If you plan to use a straight cut end, you might need to add a little fray-stop liquid to keep the end nice and straight. But again, that's true with any velvet ribbon.###pretty<3:9>|velvet<10:16>|picture<28:36>|pink<91:95>|accurately<105:115>|represent<116:127>|plush<137:142>|face<143:147>|side<189:193>|downside<185:193>|same<201:205>|velvet<215:221>|challenge<248:259>|tie<277:282>|bow<283:287>|ever<307:311>|velvet<313:319>|ever<332:336>|side<357:361>|consider<354:362>|flaw<370:374>|nature<407:413>|velvet<417:423>|never<435:440>|ever<436:440>|velvet<453:459>|part<490:494>|sewing<536:542>|handle<555:562>|appropriate<611:622>|sewing<629:635>|sewing project<629:643>|project<636:643>|a sewing project<627:643>|material<649:657>|heavy<668:675>|side<676:680>|wired<700:705>|edge<706:710>|wired edge<700:710>|fray<735:739>|badly<744:749>|plan<758:762>|straight<772:780>|cut<781:784>|cut end<781:788>|end<785:788>|add<808:811>|fray<821:825>|stop<826:830>|keep<841:845>|end<850:853>|straight<863:871>|again<877:882>|velvet<905:911>"

Can’t wait to see the finished project. Everything came on time very well packaged. Even received a very generous “freebie” package of buttons🤠 I’ll be making good use of these in other crafting projects❤️ I thought this was especially sweet since I didn’t place a large order, great company, I intend to do more shopping with Ableme Deco soon. Just added a photo of the super easy garland I’m making with this beautiful tulle. It’s a great no sew project that is fun for the kids too. Just cut desired length of garland from pretty ribbon. Than cut the tulle into approximately 4” wide pieces, and tie onto the ribbon, putting each closely together on the ribbon. No need to tie in a knot, just tie once ((like you do when tying shoe laces), just be sure to cinch tightly. Same technique as for making a rag garland.###pretty<8:14>|christmas<45:54>|craft<55:60>|craft project<55:68>|project<61:68>|absolutely<73:83>|love<84:88>|vibrant<93:100>|vibrant color<93:107>|sparkly<112:119>|effect<120:126>|wait<134:138>|finished<150:158>|project<159:166>|package<202:209>|package<202:210>|receive<217:225>|generous<233:241>|package<252:259>|craft<314:319>|craft<314:322>|project<323:330>|craft project<314:331>|project<323:331>|especially<353:363>|sweet<364:369>|place<385:390>|large<393:398>|company<412:419>|intend<423:429>|shop<441:449>|deco<462:466>|soon<467:471>|add<478:483>|photo<486:491>|super<499:504>|garland<510:517>|beautiful<539:548>|tulle<549:554>|sew<572:575>|no sew<569:575>|project<576:583>|fun<592:595>|kid<604:608>|cut<619:622>|desire<623:630>|length<631:637>|garland<641:648>|pretty<654:660>|cut<674:677>|tulle<682:687>|approximately<693:706>|wide<710:714>|piece<715:721>|tie<727:730>|put<748:755>|together<769:777>|tie<804:807>|knot<813:817>|tie<824:827>|once<828:832>|tie<852:857>|shoe<858:862>|shoe lace<858:868>|lace<863:868>|tightly<893:900>|same<902:906>|rag<933:936>|garland<937:944>"

They will be flowy. I loved the color which will lend itself to school colors. It is super soft and cut easily.

I like to use ribbons for card making, and these have just the right width (3/8 inch) and are DOUBLE-SIDED. It really looks so much better when tying bows, if the ribbon is double-sided. It just doesn’t look tidy when the “bad side” of a one sided ribbon shows up after tying a bow. Other Positives: 1) The colors are vivid, there are 20 colors. Two of the colors are gold and silver. The gold and silver are shimmery and has a grosgrain look to it. 2) The ribbons have a smooth, satin finish to it. It is made of 100% polyester. Very easy to work with and making bows. The cut ends will fray. Sometimes I use a bit of glue on the ends to stop the fraying. 3) As soon as I saw all the colors, I thought of all the different cards I can make. Red ribbon for Valentine’s and Christmas, Orange and black for Halloween, blue for July 4th, etc. 4) Value priced, too at 48 cents a spool. There are 15 yards per roll for a total of 300 yards. This will last me a long time. These ribbons are great to have on hand for crafting, gift wrapping, or party events. I recommend them for value and quality.###pretty<8:14>|ribbons<15:22>|lots<26:30>|colors<34:40>|pleasantly<51:61>|surprise<62:71>|different<113:122>|card<157:161>|making<162:168>|card making<157:168>|the right width<190:205>|width<200:205>|right width<194:205>|3/8 inch<207:215>|inch<211:215>|double<225:231>|double sided<225:237>|sided<232:237>|tie<275:280>|bow<281:284>|bow<281:285>|double<304:310>|side<311:315>|sided<311:316>|double sided<304:316>|tidy<339:343>|side<358:362>|side<373:377>|sided<373:378>|show<386:391>|tie<401:406>|bow<409:412>|positive<420:429>|vivid<449:454>|gold<499:503>|silver<508:514>|gold<520:524>|silver<529:535>|shimmery<540:548>|grosgrain<559:568>|smooth<603:609>|satin<611:616>|finish<617:623>|polyester<650:659>|100 polyester<645:659>|making<688:694>|bow<695:698>|bow<695:699>|cut<705:708>|end<709:713>|fray<719:723>|sometimes<725:734>|glue<750:754>|end<762:766>|stop<770:774>|fray<779:783>|fraying<779:786>|soon<794:798>|different<845:854>|card<855:859>|card<855:860>|red<873:876>|valentine<888:897>|christmas<904:913>|orange<915:921>|black<926:931>|halloween<936:945>|blue<947:951>|july<956:960>|4th<961:964>|spool<1006:1011>|yard<1026:1031>|15 yard<1023:1031>|roll<1036:1040>|yard per roll<1026:1040>|total<1047:1052>|yard<1060:1065>|300 yard<1056:1065>|long<1087:1091>|a long time<1085:1096>|long time<1087:1096>|hand<1133:1137>|craft<1142:1150>|gift<1152:1156>|gift wrapping<1152:1165>|wrapping<1157:1165>|party<1170:1175>|event<1176:1182>|recommend<1186:1195>"

I like to use ribbons for card making, and these have just the right width (3/8 inch) and are DOUBLE-SIDED. It really looks so much better when tying bows, if the ribbon is double-sided. It just doesn’t look tidy when the “bad side” of a one sided ribbon shows up after tying a bow. Other Positives: 1) The colors are vivid, there are 20 colors. Two of the colors are gold and silver. The gold and silver are shimmery and has a grosgrain look to it. 2) The ribbons have a smooth, satin finish to it. It is made of 100% polyester. Very easy to work with and making bows. The cut ends will fray. Sometimes I use a bit of glue on the ends to stop the fraying. 3) As soon as I saw all the colors, I thought of all the different cards I can make. Red ribbon for Valentine’s and Christmas, Orange and black for Halloween, blue for July 4th, etc. 4) Value priced, too at 48 cents a spool. There are 15 yards per roll for a total of 300 yards. This will last me a long time. These ribbons are great to have on hand for crafting, gift wrapping, or party events. I recommend them for value and quality.###pretty<8:14>|ribbons<15:22>|lots<26:30>|colors<34:40>|pleasantly<51:61>|surprise<62:71>|different<113:122>|card<157:161>|making<162:168>|card making<157:168>|the right width<190:205>|width<200:205>|right width<194:205>|3/8 inch<207:215>|inch<211:215>|double<225:231>|double sided<225:237>|sided<232:237>|tie<275:280>|bow<281:284>|bow<281:285>|double<304:310>|side<311:315>|sided<311:316>|double sided<304:316>|tidy<339:343>|side<358:362>|side<373:377>|sided<373:378>|show<386:391>|tie<401:406>|bow<409:412>|positive<420:429>|vivid<449:454>|gold<499:503>|silver<508:514>|gold<520:524>|silver<529:535>|shimmery<540:548>|grosgrain<559:568>|smooth<603:609>|satin<611:616>|finish<617:623>|polyester<650:659>|100 polyester<645:659>|making<688:694>|bow<695:698>|bow<695:699>|cut<705:708>|end<709:713>|fray<719:723>|sometimes<725:734>|glue<750:754>|end<762:766>|stop<770:774>|fray<779:783>|fraying<779:786>|soon<794:798>|different<845:854>|card<855:859>|card<855:860>|red<873:876>|valentine<888:897>|christmas<904:913>|orange<915:921>|black<926:931>|halloween<936:945>|blue<947:951>|july<956:960>|4th<961:964>|spool<1006:1011>|yard<1026:1031>|15 yard<1023:1031>|roll<1036:1040>|yard per roll<1026:1040>|total<1047:1052>|yard<1060:1065>|300 yard<1056:1065>|long<1087:1091>|a long time<1085:1096>|long time<1087:1096>|hand<1133:1137>|craft<1142:1150>|gift<1152:1156>|gift wrapping<1152:1165>|wrapping<1157:1165>|party<1170:1175>|event<1176:1182>|recommend<1186:1195>"

I let its poor-quality go, though, since I intended to use it only for hanging ornaments on a little tree & I had no difficulty looping it into the ring of each of the small ornaments to be hung later in the year. That was before actually hanging them on the tree. Its lacking in body made it difficult to tie the bows whose little loops just hung, adding difficulty to completing the bow since I had to make the loops small just to get them to stand up. If you can imagine trying to make a bow with thread or string, you'll understand how that made a job which should have been pleasant a labor instead. It was also the first time that I had ribbon snag while I was working with it.

The texture is matte, not shiny, which I prefer. Each spool has 5 yards of ribbon for a total of 15 yards. The price seems a bit high for this type of ribbon and I’m sure it’s due to the wooden spools. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. Sometimes having reusable wooden spools is exactly why I’ve made a specific purchase. This ribbon can be used in a variety of ways. I’ll be using when wrapping Christmas gifts, for hanging ornaments on my Christmas tree, and for embellishing fall/winter clothes I’ll be sewing for my granddaughters. I’ll add pictures when I can.

They measure 3/8” wide and 5 yards in length which is plenty for my purposes. The colors are exactly as they appeared on my screen and they remind me of vintage ribbons I have found in my grandmother’s sewing box. I’ve used this ribbon to hang Christmas ornaments on my tree, to tie around Christmas gifts and create sweet bows, and also for some sewing projects where I’m using these ribbons to embellish some clothes I’m making for my granddaughters. I recommend if you are considering purchasing this ribbon to pay attention to the measurements of this ribbon so you won’t be shocked when receiving a 3/8” wide ribbon! 😊I definitely recommend these ribbons.###lovely<3:9>|set<10:13>|wide<32:36>|yard<43:48>|5 yard<41:48>|length<52:58>|yard in length<43:58>|dusty<60:65>|blue<66:70>|green<75:80>|ivory<86:91>|vine<96:100>|customer<101:109>|free<120:124>|set<144:147>|dusty<168:173>|blue<174:178>|green<180:185>|ivory<190:195>|measure<209:216>|wide<222:226>|yard<233:238>|5 yard<231:238>|length<242:248>|yard in length<233:248>|plenty<258:264>|purpose<272:280>|appear<313:321>|screen<328:334>|remind<344:350>|vintage<357:364>|find<380:385>|sewing<406:412>|box<413:416>|hang<443:447>|christmas<448:457>|christmas ornament<448:467>|ornament<458:467>|tree<474:478>|tie<483:486>|christmas<494:503>|gift<504:509>|christmas gift<494:509>|create<514:520>|sweet<521:526>|bow<527:531>|sewing<551:557>|sewing project<551:566>|project<558:566>|embellish<600:609>|clothe<615:622>|granddaughter<641:655>|recommend<659:668>|consider<680:691>|pay<718:721>|attention<722:731>|measure<739:746>|measurement<739:751>|receive<796:805>|wide<813:817>|definitely<829:839>|recommend<840:849>"

Works well. Things I love: There are some that are winter themed, others Christmas, others just solid colors. So I can use this for Christmas things, winter things, or regular things. Good quality ribbon Things I don't like so much: The thicker ribbon wasn't as wide as I thought it was going to be. I really didn't have a bag or anything to put them in after I removed them from the original wrapping. I shoved them all in a ziplock bag... Overall I like them. We had fun making little Christmas tree ornaments out of cinnamon sticks, jewels, and this ribbon.###selection<9:18>|wide<24:28>|one<29:33>|wide<44:48>|holiday<84:91>|craft<92:100>|love<139:143>|winter<169:175>|theme<176:182>|christmas<191:200>|solid<214:219>|christmas<250:259>|winter<268:274>|regular<286:293>|good quality ribbon<302:321>|thick<355:362>|wide<380:384>|bag<441:444>|put<460:463>|remove<480:487>|wrapping<511:519>|shove<523:529>|ziplock<544:551>|bag<552:555>|ziplock bag<544:555>|overall<559:566>|fun<587:590>|christmas<605:614>|christmas tree<605:619>|tree<615:619>|ornament<620:629>|cinnamon<637:645>|stick<646:652>|jewel<654:660>",

It’s nice and thick! The red side is like suede while the glitter side is very glittery(glitter does come off). I have no complaints about the glitter coming off because that’s what I expect from every glitter product especially Christmas decorations. It doesn’t fall off like crazy but you will get some glitter on yourself or elsewhere while making your Christmas bows. This ribbon could hold a beautiful loop and curl on Christmas tree!

This is a nice set of spools of ribbon with six different Grinch-y designs. Each spool has five yards of wired ribbon. Two of the ribbons are glitter based and the other four are plain. The ribbons are of good quality and the designs are clear and crisp. The variety is great as you can match the more obvious Grinch themes with the more neutral. Of course, you can use them singly as well. These are good enough quality that they can be used for packages but also for more decor related crafts. Adorning a tree, dressing up a swag, a design element of porch pots, using them as part of a tablescape in your dining room for a dinner party, all of these would be great places to utilize these ribbons. If you use them indoors and are careful about how you pack them away I think you could even get multiple seasons worth of use from them. At less than $3 per roll they seem reasonably priced.###variety<8:15>|sister<23:29>|obsessed<42:50>|grinch<60:66>|pack<87:91>|pack of ribbon<87:102>|gift<119:124>|adorn<135:142>|set<169:172>|spool<176:181>|spool<176:182>|different<202:211>|grinch<212:218>|design<221:227>|design<221:228>|spool<235:240>|each spool<230:240>|yard<250:255>|five yard<245:255>|wired<259:264>|wired ribbon<259:271>|glitter<296:303>|base<304:309>|plain<333:338>|design<380:386>|design<380:387>|clear<392:397>|crisp<402:407>|variety<413:420>|match<441:446>|obvious<456:463>|grinch<464:470>|theme<471:477>|neutral<492:499>|course<504:510>|pack<601:605>|package<601:609>|decor<628:633>|craft<642:648>|adorn<650:658>|tree<661:665>|dress<667:675>|swag<681:685>|design<689:695>|element<696:703>|porch<707:712>|pot<713:717>|part<733:737>|room<769:773>|dinner<780:786>|part<787:791>|party<787:792>|place<822:828>|indoor<871:878>|careful<887:894>|pack<909:913>|away<919:923>|multiple<951:959>|season<960:967>|worth<968:973>|less<995:999>|roll<1012:1016>|reasonably<1027:1037>",

        "hanging ornaments###hang<0:7>|ornament<8:17>|||B09MBZC8Q8 ★★★☆☆ [2020-09-26] <b>Nice, with a couple of issues.</b> This ribbon looks nice enough if you just need something to use to hang thinga with, but I was disappointed for several reasons. The first is my fault: I really didn't do the math well when I ordered this, and I just didn't realize how short a length I would get off each color. Some of these colors are gorgeous, but others I know I'm unlikely to use again. That tends to mean the colors I don't like will pile up, if I try to re-purchase more of the ones I do like - and that will happen quickly, with only 1 yard of each color. I really, really hate the way these were packed. The product picture shows each color rolled separately, but that's not what you get. Instead, you get about a half-dozen large rolls, which contain multiple colors. Without unrolling each one, it's impossible to see what's there. Because of this before I could even use the ribbon, I spent an hour and a half unrolling the big rolls and making small, individual rolls with each color. After that, I can see and access them all easily. But honestly, I really had much better things to do with my time than repack 30 yards of ribbon. The quality isn't bad. I had hoped for thicker ribbon, as I planned to use these to make necklaces and I want them to last. A thicker pile to the ribbon would prevent it from wrinkling too easily, and would keep it from looking prematurely worn. Anything I make from these, I will have to charge a bit less for and warn customers that the necklace cord will eventually wear out. What I do like: many of these colors are stunning. It is nice to have a sampler to allow me to figure out what I need most. I really hope that they hold up better than I am expecting. Time will tell. If all you need is ribbons for trim, or to hang ornaments from, these are a good choice. I think, however, they for my purposes, I am going to have to keep looking for higher quality.###couple<16:22>|a couple<14:22>|issue<26:32>|hang<105:109>|disappoint<133:145>|re<158:160>|reason<158:165>|fault<183:188>|re<192:194>|the math<209:217>|math<213:217>|re<234:236>|re<262:264>|realize<262:269>|short<274:279>|length<282:288>|re<339:341>|gorgeous<342:350>|unlikely<374:382>|again<390:395>|tend<402:407>|mean<411:415>|pile<445:449>|re<466:468>|re<480:482>|one<490:493>|one<490:494>|happen<521:527>|quickly<528:535>|1 yard<547:553>|yard<549:553>|re<571:573>|re<579:581>|hate<586:590>|re<607:609>|pack<610:616>|re<635:637>|picture<630:637>|show<638:643>|roll<655:661>|instead<703:710>|half<728:732>|large<739:744>|roll<745:750>|large roll<739:750>|contain<758:765>|multiple<766:774>|unroll<791:800>|one<806:809>|impossible<816:826>|re<844:846>|re<868:870>|spend<902:907>|an hour<908:915>|hour<911:915>|half<922:926>|unroll<927:936>|big<941:944>|roll<945:950>|big roll<941:950>|small<962:967>|individual<969:979>|roll<980:985>|individual roll<969:985>|access<1029:1035>|easily<1045:1051>|one<1058:1061>|one<1058:1062>|honestly<1057:1065>|re<1069:1071>|re<1123:1125>|yard<1133:1137>|yard<1133:1138>|30 yard<1130:1138>|hope<1179:1183>|hope<1179:1184>|thick<1189:1196>|plan<1210:1217>|necklace<1239:1247>|necklace<1239:1248>|thick<1276:1283>|pile<1284:1288>|re<1310:1312>|prevent<1309:1316>|wrinkle<1325:1334>|easily<1339:1345>|keep<1357:1361>|re<1379:1381>|re<1385:1387>|worn<1390:1394>|charge<1439:1445>|less<1452:1456>|warn<1465:1469>|customer<1470:1479>|necklace<1489:1497>|cord<1498:1502>|eventually<1508:1518>|wear<1519:1523>|re<1567:1569>|stunning<1570:1578>|allow<1612:1617>|re<1628:1630>|figure<1624:1630>|most<1647:1651>|re<1655:1657>|hope<1662:1666>|hold<1677:1681>|trim<1760:1764>|hang<1772:1776>|ornament<1777:1786>|re<1800:1802>|choice<1810:1816>|however<1827:1834>|purpose<1848:1856>|keep<1880:1884>|high<1897:1903>|high quality<1897:1911>",

Instead of a garish, bright red, it is a muted, elegant shade. It is so very lush and velvety that it makes even the simplest packages look posh. Only one side of the ribbon is plush. The other is a ribbed, satiny texture. Because it isn't wide, it's easy to tie and wrap with, and it looks delicate and tasteful. I plan to use it to wrap presents, but I might also use some as ornament hangers and to decorate cards with.

This 3/8-inch by 30 yards of sheer elegance transformed my ornaments and made them look ten times more expensive. Incredible Quality for Ornament Hanging: Stunning Appearance: The rich, deep green color of this ribbon added a layer of opulence to my ornaments. It has an innate luxuriousness that genuinely stands out, making each piece look like a carefully curated masterpiece. High-Quality Velvet Texture: The texture of the velvet is where this ribbon truly shines. The high-quality velvet feels soft and lush, and what's more, it avoids the overly shiny look that some ribbons tend to have. The subdued sheen enhances the overall elegance of the product. Non-Slip and Secure: One of the key highlights is the non-slip nature of this ribbon. Whether creating bows or simply hanging ornaments, the ribbon holds everything securely in place.

Theses ribbons are just 3/8 inch wide, But if you you're going to be wrapping small gifts and making small bows these ribbons will be ideal for you. There're also great for hanging ornaments or using when making Christmas themed crafts etc. We love the patterns, festive designs and Christmas colors....it all helps in creating a joyful Christmas atmosphere. The amount of ribbons in this set amounts to 300 feet. Enough to last many Christmases!

There are no end shredding or stray threads. I personally like wired ribbons because it stays in the shape you want it to, especially bows. I will use this mostly for gift wrapping as I have a lot of blue Christmas wrappings from a clearance purchase 2 years ago. Do not limit this ribbon to wrappings, it's perfect for decor bows, add to garland, a ribbon that goes around a tree or placed downwards. To get a nice curl roll the ribbon from the bottom up and once in position unroll it.

I had to make it work in a small space. BUT, I LOVE this ribbon/garland. It's the red middle string option, so you're able to bunch it up, which is so beautiful. This tree is only 6.5 Ft tall, & the ribbon is only on the front. So, what you see is the full 30 Ft of product. If you plan to wrap it around the entire tree, I'd recommend at least 2 rolls, 3 if you have a bigger tree.###love<3:7>|odd<32:35>|christmas<36:45>|christmas tree<36:50>|tree<46:50>|small<79:84>|space<85:90>|love<99:103>|garland<116:123>|red<134:137>|middle<138:144>|string<145:151>|option<152:158>|able<170:174>|bunch<178:183>|beautiful<203:212>|tree<219:223>|ft<236:238>|tall<239:243>|front<273:278>|full<304:308>|ft<312:314>|30 ft<309:314>|plan<334:338>|wrap<342:346>|entire<361:367>|tree<368:372>|recommend<378:387>|least<391:396>|2 roll<397:404>|roll<399:404>|big<422:428>|tree<429:433>",

I needed something to kind of fill in gaps and make my candy/sweets/candyland tree look more full and this worked perfectly. I had enough with one and a little bit of another to do my 6 foot tree in 3 full length sections and 3 half length sections. The only downside to this stuff is the edges are really weird and like to catch on EVERYTHING! So working with it it kept catching my shirt and branches and I’d have to pull it to get it free and it would mess up what I had pulled into the tree already. May just be how this stuff is but I don’t know because this is my first time using stuff like this so I figured I’d throw that warning out there.###annoying<19:27>|listing<58:65>|the listing<54:65>|image<66:72>|purpose<119:126>|absolutely<138:148>|unwrapped<171:180>|pastel<210:216>|pastel color<210:222>|color scheme<217:229>|scheme<223:229>|kind<270:274>|fill<278:282>|gap<286:290>|candy<303:308>|sweet<309:315>|candy<316:321>|tree<326:330>|full<341:345>|perfectly<362:371>|foot<434:438>|6 foot<432:438>|tree<439:443>|foot tree<434:443>|full<449:453>|length<454:460>|full length<449:460>|section<461:469>|half<476:480>|length<481:487>|section<488:496>|only downside<502:515>|downside<507:515>|the only downside<498:515>|edge<537:542>|weird<554:559>|catch<572:577>|keep<615:619>|catch<620:625>|catch<620:628>|shirt<632:637>|branch<642:650>|pull<667:671>|free<685:689>|mess<703:707>|pull<722:726>|pull<722:728>|tree<738:742>|already<743:750>|figure<856:863>|throw<868:873>|warn<879:886>",

The texture is matte, not shiny, which I prefer. Each spool has 5 yards of ribbon for a total of 15 yards. The price seems a bit high for this type of ribbon and I’m sure it’s due to the wooden spools. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. Sometimes having reusable wooden spools is exactly why I’ve made a specific purchase. This ribbon can be used in a variety of ways. I’ll be using when wrapping Christmas gifts, for hanging ornaments on my Christmas tree, and for embellishing fall/winter clothes I’ll be sewing for my granddaughters. I’ll add pictures when I can. I recommend this item only if you plan to reuse the wooden spools once the ribbon has been used.###spool<5:10>|spool<5:11>|3 spool<3:11>|lovely<15:21>|dark<22:26>|green<27:32>|opaque<33:39>|vine<54:58>|customer<59:67>|free<78:82>|set<96:99>|wooden<105:111>|spool<112:117>|wooden spool<105:118>|spool<112:118>|dark<122:126>|green<127:132>|opaque<133:139>|fray<152:158>|edge<159:164>|satiny<171:177>|feel<178:182>|one side<186:194>|side<190:194>|texture<214:221>|matte<225:230>|shiny<236:241>|prefer<251:257>|each spool<259:269>|spool<264:269>|yard<276:281>|5 yard<274:281>|total<298:303>|yard<310:315>|15 yard<307:315>|5 yard<308:315>|high<339:343>|type<353:357>|type of ribbon<353:367>|wooden<397:403>|spool<404:409>|the wooden spool<393:410>|wooden spool<397:410>|spool<404:410>|keep<412:416>|mind<425:429>|sometimes<468:477>|reusable<485:493>|wooden<494:500>|spool<501:506>|wooden spool<494:507>|spool<501:507>|specific<535:543>|variety<583:590>|wrap<619:627>|christmas<628:637>|christmas gift<628:643>|gift<638:643>|hang<649:656>|ornament<657:666>|christmas<673:682>|christmas tree<673:687>|tree<683:687>|embellish<697:709>|fall<710:714>|winter<715:721>|clothe<722:729>|sew<738:744>|granddaughter<752:766>|add<773:776>|picture<777:785>|recommend<800:809>|plan<832:836>|reuse<840:845>|wooden<850:856>|spool<857:862>|wooden spool<850:863>|the wooden spool<846:863>|spool<857:863>"

It's too early to pull out the tree and take photos so instead I placed the ribbon against some other backgrounds to show the rose gold color and detail. It's not overly sparkly with just some shimmery threads running lengthwise down the ribbon. The ribbon is a very thin mesh which I like because it will look delicate and not heavy on the tree. The stiff mesh catches on everything which is very annoying but also very helpful - I can tuck it in between branches so that it holds its shape and remains tucked.###decorate<13:23>|tree<27:31>|decorate<67:75>|christmas<79:88>|christmas tree<79:93>|tree<89:93>|early<104:109>|pull<113:117>|tree<126:130>|photo<140:146>|instead<150:157>|place<160:166>|background<197:208>|show<212:216>|rose<221:225>|rose gold<221:230>|gold<226:230>|the rose gold<217:230>|rose gold color<221:236>|detail<241:247>|overly<258:264>|sparkly<265:272>|shimmery<288:296>|thread<297:304>|run<305:312>|lengthwise<313:323>|thin<362:366>|mesh<367:371>|delicate<406:414>|heavy<423:428>|tree<436:440>|stiff<446:451>|mesh<452:456>|catch<457:464>|thin<473:477>|annoying<493:501>|helpful<516:523>|tuck<532:536>|branch<551:559>|hold<571:576>|shape<581:586>|remain<591:598>|tuck<599:603>|tuck<599:605>"

The texture is matte, not shiny, which I prefer. Each spool has 5 yards of ribbon for a total of 15 yards. The price seems a bit high for this type of ribbon and I’m sure it’s due to the wooden spools. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. Sometimes having reusable wooden spools is exactly why I’ve made a specific purchase. This ribbon can be used in a variety of ways. I’ll be using when wrapping Christmas gifts, for hanging ornaments on my Christmas tree, and for embellishing fall/winter clothes I’ll be sewing for my granddaughters. I’ll add pictures when I can. I recommend this item only if you plan to reuse the wooden spools once the ribbon has been used.###spool<5:10>|spool<5:11>|3 spool<3:11>|lovely<15:21>|dark<22:26>|green<27:32>|opaque<33:39>|vine<54:58>|customer<59:67>|free<78:82>|set<96:99>|wooden<105:111>|spool<112:117>|wooden spool<105:118>|spool<112:118>|dark<122:126>|green<127:132>|opaque<133:139>|fray<152:158>|edge<159:164>|satiny<171:177>|feel<178:182>|one side<186:194>|side<190:194>|texture<214:221>|matte<225:230>|shiny<236:241>|prefer<251:257>|each spool<259:269>|spool<264:269>|yard<276:281>|5 yard<274:281>|total<298:303>|yard<310:315>|15 yard<307:315>|5 yard<308:315>|high<339:343>|type<353:357>|type of ribbon<353:367>|wooden<397:403>|spool<404:409>|the wooden spool<393:410>|wooden spool<397:410>|spool<404:410>|keep<412:416>|mind<425:429>|sometimes<468:477>|reusable<485:493>|wooden<494:500>|spool<501:506>|wooden spool<494:507>|spool<501:507>|specific<535:543>|variety<583:590>|wrap<619:627>|christmas<628:637>|christmas gift<628:643>|gift<638:643>|hang<649:656>|ornament<657:666>|christmas<673:682>|christmas tree<673:687>|tree<683:687>|embellish<697:709>|fall<710:714>|winter<715:721>|clothe<722:729>|sew<738:744>|granddaughter<752:766>|add<773:776>|picture<777:785>|recommend<800:809>|plan<832:836>|reuse<840:845>|wooden<850:856>|spool<857:862>|wooden spool<850:863>|the wooden spool<846:863>|spool<857:863>"

The ribbon sheds a fair amount of glitter and gets everywhere a bit so be mindful of that, but the ribbon is still sparkly on the tree. I used two strands from two rolls to go around my 7ft tree which is approx 130cm wide. I used two strands so that I would have the desired gap between layers at my desired angle all the way around the tree. It looks lovely and much nicer than tinsel. This was the only wide ribbon I could find online in the UK. The last photo is to show how much ribbon was used to achieve the look I did, the roll on the left is unopened, and the other two rolls are the rolls I took my two strands from (I didn’t use strands from the same roll incase the roll ran out mid second-strand) I recommend the product.###beautiful<9:18>|christmas<22:31>|tree<32:36>|christmas tree<22:36>|gold<52:56>|pack<57:61>|7 ft<95:98>|ft<96:98>|artificial<99:109>|tree<110:114>|shed<127:132>|fair<135:139>|amount<140:146>|fair amount<135:146>|glitter<150:157>|amount of glitter<140:157>|everywhere<167:177>|still<225:230>|sparkly<231:238>|tree<246:250>|run<265:268>|strand<263:269>|strand<263:270>|two strand<259:270>|roll<280:284>|two roll<276:285>|roll<280:285>|ft<303:305>|7 ft<302:305>|ft tree<303:310>|tree<306:310>|approx<320:326>|cm<330:332>|wide<333:337>|run<352:355>|strand<350:356>|two strand<346:357>|strand<350:357>|desire<383:390>|gap<391:394>|layer<403:409>|desire<416:423>|angle<424:429>|tree<453:457>|lovely<468:474>|wide<521:525>|find<541:545>|online<546:552>|photo<573:578>|show<585:589>|achieve<618:625>|roll<646:650>|ft<660:662>|left<658:662>|roll<694:698>|roll<694:699>|two roll<690:699>|roll<708:712>|roll<708:713>|run<730:733>|strand<728:734>|strand<728:735>|two strand<724:735>|run<757:760>|strand<755:761>|strand<755:762>|same<772:776>|roll<777:781>|roll<793:797>|run<798:801>|mid<806:809>|second<810:816>|run<819:822>|strand<817:823>|recommend<827:836>"

This ribbon will be perfect for featuring The Grinch in the center and then using the \"plain\" ribbons and/or coordinating fabrics for the rest of the ornament. The ribbon is decent quality, although a bit thinner than I expected. For what I use it for though, that's a plus. The value is akin to big box craft store prices, unless you have a store coupon, which would make this a bit pricier. Overall, it's a fun assortment and is an excellent addition to my ribbon hoard. However, because it's so fun, I may actually use it this year to share with family & friends.

The colors and printing are definitely Grinchy and they nail the exact hues and images from the movies. The wire is flexible and easy to manipulate into bows or otherwise. The material isn't the greatest and has some sheerness to it, but when they're all tied up, they look fantastic and full. Two of the rolls have glitter accents, the others do not. The glitter does tend to shed, as glitter does, so be aware of that. The rolls are short and probably not enough in one roll to wrap a gift properly. They are, however, perfect for wreath and tree bows or other DIY holiday crafts.

This ribbon will be perfect for featuring The Grinch in the center and then using the \"plain\" ribbons and/or coordinating fabrics for the rest of the ornament. The ribbon is decent quality, although a bit thinner than I expected. For what I use it for though, that's a plus. The value is akin to big box craft store prices, unless you have a store coupon, which would make this a bit pricier. Overall, it's a fun assortment and is an excellent addition to my ribbon hoard. However, because it's so fun, I may actually use it this year to share with family & friends. Because who (no pun intended) doesn't love The Grinch?###grinch<3:9>|ornament<10:18>|ornament<10:19>|year<38:42>|this year<33:42>|sew<58:61>|no sew<55:61>|quilted<62:69>|ornament<70:78>|ornament<70:79>|textile<96:104>|love<107:111>|wide<127:131>|require<150:158>|cut<168:171>|size<183:187>|feature<228:237>|grinch<242:248>|center<256:262>|plain<283:288>|coordinate<305:317>|fabric<318:325>|rest<334:338>|the rest<330:338>|ornament<346:354>|decent<370:376>|decent quality<370:384>|though<388:394>|thin<401:408>|though<448:454>|plus<465:469>|big<492:495>|box<496:499>|big box<492:499>|craft<500:505>|store<506:511>|craft store<500:511>|store<538:543>|overall<589:596>|fun<605:608>|assortment<609:619>|addition<640:648>|however<669:676>|fun<694:697>|actually<705:713>|year<726:730>|this year<721:730>|family<745:751>|friend<754:761>|intend<783:791>|love<801:805>|grinch<810:816>"

This ribbon will be perfect for featuring The Grinch in the center and then using the \"plain\" ribbons and/or coordinating fabrics for the rest of the ornament. The ribbon is decent quality, although a bit thinner than I expected. For what I use it for though, that's a plus. The value is akin to big box craft store prices, unless you have a store coupon, which would make this a bit pricier. Overall, it's a fun assortment and is an excellent addition to my ribbon hoard. However, because it's so fun, I may actually use it this year to share with family & friends.

The ribbon added a touch of sparkle and elegance to the tree, and it really made the decorations stand out. I also used the ribbon to wrap some gifts, and it looked great. I would highly recommend the ALTIER Silver and Gold Metallic Ribbon to anyone looking for a beautiful and durable ribbon for their Christmas decorations. It's a great value for the price, and it's sure to add a touch of sparkle to your holiday décor. Here are some additional pros and cons of the ALTIER Silver and Gold Metallic Ribbon: Pros: Beautiful and elegant look Durable and long-lasting Easy to shape Cons: Can get glitter spread around your wrapping or decorating area. Overall, I highly recommend the ALTIER Silver and Gold Metallic Ribbon. It's a beautiful, durable, and affordable ribbon that's perfect for Christmas decorations and other projects.###altier<3:9>|altier silver<3:16>|silver<10:16>|gold<21:25>|metallic<26:34>|gold metallic<21:34>|gold metallic ribbon<21:41>|christmas<66:75>|tree<76:80>|christmas tree<66:80>|decoration<81:91>|christmas tree decoration<66:91>|beautiful<116:125>|durable<130:137>|christmas<159:168>|tree<169:173>|christmas tree<159:173>|decoration<174:185>|christmas tree decoration<159:185>|this year<186:195>|year<191:195>|glad<208:212>|find<215:220>|altier<225:231>|silver<232:238>|altier silver<225:238>|gold<243:247>|metallic<248:256>|gold metallic<243:256>|gold metallic ribbon<243:263>|high<287:291>|high quality<287:299>|material<300:309>|high quality material<287:309>|tear<331:335>|break<337:342>|crinkle<344:351>|unravel<353:360>|fade<365:369>|wired<375:380>|edge<381:386>|wired edge<375:386>|the wired edge<371:386>|shape<403:408>|bow<425:429>|sheer<439:444>|fabric<445:451>|give<452:457>|beautiful<463:472>|elegant<474:481>|decorate<509:517>|christmas<521:530>|christmas tree<521:535>|tree<531:535>|turn<544:550>|beautiful<555:564>|beautifully<555:566>|add<579:582>|add<579:584>|touch<587:592>|sparkle<596:603>|elegance<608:616>|tree<624:628>|decoration<653:664>|stand<665:670>|wrap<702:706>|gift<712:717>|high<748:752>|highly<748:754>|recommend<755:764>|altier<769:775>|altier silver<769:782>|silver<776:782>|gold<787:791>|metallic<792:800>|gold metallic<787:800>|gold metallic ribbon<787:807>|beautiful<832:841>|durable<846:853>|christmas<871:880>|christmas decoration<871:892>|decoration<881:892>|add<945:948>|touch<951:956>|sparkle<960:967>|holiday<976:983>|décor<984:989>|add<1005:1008>|additional<1005:1015>|pro<1016:1020>|con<1025:1029>|altier<1037:1043>|altier silver<1037:1050>|silver<1044:1050>|gold<1055:1059>|metallic<1060:1068>|gold metallic<1055:1068>|gold metallic ribbon<1055:1075>|pro<1077:1081>|beautiful<1083:1092>|elegant<1097:1104>|durable<1110:1117>|long<1122:1126>|shape<1143:1148>|con<1149:1153>|glitter<1163:1170>|spread<1171:1177>|wrap<1190:1194>|wrapping<1190:1198>|decorate<1202:1212>|area<1213:1217>|overall<1219:1226>|high<1230:1234>|highly<1230:1236>|recommend<1237:1246>|altier<1251:1257>|altier silver<1251:1264>|silver<1258:1264>|gold<1269:1273>|gold metallic<1269:1282>|metallic<1274:1282>|gold metallic ribbon<1269:1289>|beautiful<1298:1307>|durable<1309:1316>|affordable<1322:1332>|christmas<1359:1368>|christmas decoration<1359:1380>|decoration<1369:1380>|project<1391:1399>",

With that said, once I got over the packaging, each one was fun to use. The variety is what I liked the most. If you need lengthy ribbons, you might need a supplement or other ribbons to add to your wrapping assortment.

I was definitely pleased with the quality of this ribbon. The red glitter definitely adds a beautiful touch to Christmas decorations. Although, it leaves a trail of red glitter wherever you go, haha! The wired edge makes shaping and creating bows super easy and they hold their shape perfectly. This ribbon is perfect for anyone trying to add a festive upscale look to their tree, gifts, or anything else that needs an extra touch. Based on the glitter shed from the ribbon, I can’t tell how long the ribbon will last but I think we will get a couple of seasons out of it which is perfect for the price point.

These are so lovely. They will be wonderful for Christmas crafting and wrapping small gifts. These are very pretty soft fluffy ribbons. The red is a nice rich deep red. Green is a softer version of a color and not overly dark. What a treat to have them on wooden spools. I will probably use those in my crafting too when the ribbon is gone. There are 5 yards of each color ribbon on the spools. For my crafting this will go fairly far, but if you are wrapping large gifts or doing large projects just know the amount you need. These are perfect for holidays and would make a lovely gift. The whole set feels very special.###velvet<13:19>|soft<24:28>|velvet<42:48>|delightful<60:70>|wooden<71:77>|wooden spool<71:84>|spool<78:84>|lovely<99:105>|christmas<134:143>|craft<144:152>|wrap<157:165>|small<166:171>|gift<172:176>|gift<172:177>|pretty<194:200>|soft<201:205>|fluffy<206:212>|red<226:229>|rich<240:244>|deep<245:249>|red<250:253>|deep red<245:253>|green<255:260>|soft<266:270>|soft<266:272>|version<273:280>|overly<300:306>|dark<307:311>|treat<320:325>|wooden<342:348>|wooden spool<342:355>|spool<349:355>|probably<364:372>|craft<389:397>|yard<439:444>|5 yard<437:444>|spool<473:479>|craft<488:496>|fairly<510:516>|far<517:520>|wrap<537:545>|large<546:551>|gift<552:556>|gift<552:557>|large<567:572>|project<573:581>|amount<596:602>|holiday<635:643>|lovely<661:667>|gift<668:672>|whole<678:683>|set<684:687>|feel<688:693>|special<699:706>",

They measure 3/8” wide and 5 yards in length which is plenty for my purposes. The colors are exactly as they appeared on my screen and they remind me of vintage ribbons I have found in my grandmother’s sewing box. I’ve used this ribbon to hang Christmas ornaments on my tree, to tie around Christmas gifts and create sweet bows, and also for some sewing projects where I’m using these ribbons to embellish some clothes I’m making for my granddaughters. I recommend if you are considering purchasing this ribbon to pay attention to the measurements of this ribbon so you won’t be shocked when receiving a 3/8” wide ribbon! 😊I definitely recommend these ribbons.###lovely<3:9>|set<10:13>|wide<32:36>|yard<43:48>|5 yard<41:48>|length<52:58>|yard in length<43:58>|dusty<60:65>|blue<66:70>|green<75:80>|ivory<86:91>|vine<96:100>|customer<101:109>|free<120:124>|set<144:147>|dusty<168:173>|blue<174:178>|green<180:185>|ivory<190:195>|measure<209:216>|wide<222:226>|yard<233:238>|5 yard<231:238>|length<242:248>|yard in length<233:248>|plenty<258:264>|purpose<272:280>|appear<313:321>|screen<328:334>|remind<344:350>|vintage<357:364>|find<380:385>|sewing<406:412>|box<413:416>|hang<443:447>|christmas<448:457>|christmas ornament<448:467>|ornament<458:467>|tree<474:478>|tie<483:486>|christmas<494:503>|gift<504:509>|christmas gift<494:509>|create<514:520>|sweet<521:526>|bow<527:531>|sewing<551:557>|sewing project<551:566>|project<558:566>|embellish<600:609>|clothe<615:622>|granddaughter<641:655>|recommend<659:668>|consider<680:691>|pay<718:721>|attention<722:731>|measure<739:746>|measurement<739:751>|receive<796:805>|wide<813:817>|definitely<829:839>|recommend<840:849>",

Ich bin auch nicht enttäuscht worden. Die Farbe ist wirklich toll. Auch die Qualität des Bandes kann überzeugen. Die Breite ist ca. 10 cm, die Länge soll lt. Hersteller 20 m sein, nachgemessen habe ich aber nicht. Die Vorder- und Rückseite des Bandes sind etwas unterschiedlich glänzend und dieses Band sieht zu einer Schleife gebunden sehr edel aus. Ich werde es mir für besondere Geschenke zurücklegen. Ein kleiner Tipp von mir: Wenn man so ein schönes Band mehrfach verwenden möchte (für Weihnachtsdeko z.B.), dann kann man Knicke und Falten ganz einfach wegbügeln, wenn man das Bügeleisen auf ganz schwache Hitze stellt. Fazit: Einn wirklich, tolles, dekoratives Band, allerdings auch nicht günstig.###sehr<3:7>|sehr schöne<3:15>|schöne<8:15>|schöne band<8:20>|band<16:20>|preis<37:42>|ich<47:50>|ich habe<47:55>|habe<51:55>|mir<56:59>|die<60:63>|diesis<60:66>|satinband<67:76>|rot<80:83>|aus<84:87>|mir<101:104>|die<105:108>|die farbe<105:114>|farbe<109:114>|auf<115:118>|den<119:122>|gut<142:145>|hat<155:158>|ich<160:163>|bin<164:167>|auch<168:172>|ich<174:177>|nicht<173:178>|den<193:196>|die<198:201>|farbe<202:207>|die farbe<198:207>|farbe ist<202:211>|ist<208:211>|wirklich<212:220>|ich<217:220>|toll<221:225>|auch<227:231>|die<232:235>|qualität<236:244>|des<245:248>|band<249:253>|des<252:255>|kann<256:260>|die<273:276>|breite<277:283>|ist<284:287>|ca<288:290>|10 cm<292:297>|cm<295:297>|die<299:302>|länge<303:308>|lt<314:316>|20 m<329:333>|ein<335:338>|sein<334:338>|habe<353:357>|ich<358:361>|habe ich<353:361>|aber<362:366>|ich<368:371>|nicht<367:372>|die<374:377>|und<386:389>|des<400:403>|band<404:408>|des<407:410>|sind<411:415>|etwa<416:421>|ich<434:437>|glänzend<438:446>|und<447:450>|die<451:454>|diesis<451:457>|band<458:462>|sieht<463:468>|zu<469:471>|ein<472:475>|einer<472:477>|schleife<478:486>|und<490:493>|den<492:495>|sehr<496:500>|edel<501:505>|aus<506:509>|ich<511:514>|mir<524:527>|für<528:531>|geschenke<542:551>|zu<552:554>|ein<565:568>|ein<571:574>|einer<571:576>|von<582:585>|mir<586:589>|wenn<591:595>|man<596:599>|ein<603:606>|schöne<607:614>|schöne band<607:619>|band<615:619>|den<635:638>|verwenden<629:638>|für<647:650>|dann<673:677>|kann<678:682>|man<683:686>|kann man<678:686>|und<694:697>|lt<700:702>|ganz<705:709>|ein<710:713>|einfach<710:717>|wenn<729:733>|man<734:737>|das<738:741>|auf<753:756>|ganz<757:761>|lt<781:783>|fazit<785:790>|ein<792:795>|wirklich<797:805>|ich<802:805>|toll<807:811>|tolle<807:813>|band<827:831>|auch<844:848>|ich<850:853>|nicht<849:854>",

I like to use ribbons for card making, and these have just the right width (3/8 inch) and are DOUBLE-SIDED. It really looks so much better when tying bows, if the ribbon is double-sided. It just doesn’t look tidy when the “bad side” of a one sided ribbon shows up after tying a bow. Other Positives: 1) The colors are vivid, there are 20 colors. Two of the colors are gold and silver. The gold and silver are shimmery and has a grosgrain look to it. 2) The ribbons have a smooth, satin finish to it. It is made of 100% polyester. Very easy to work with and making bows. The cut ends will fray. Sometimes I use a bit of glue on the ends to stop the fraying. 3) As soon as I saw all the colors, I thought of all the different cards I can make. Red ribbon for Valentine’s and Christmas, Orange and black for Halloween, blue for July 4th, etc. 4) Value priced, too at 48 cents a spool. There are 15 yards per roll for a total of 300 yards. This will last me a long time. These ribbons are great to have on hand for crafting, gift wrapping, or party events. I recommend them for value and quality.###pretty<8:14>|ribbons<15:22>|lots<26:30>|colors<34:40>|pleasantly<51:61>|surprise<62:71>|different<113:122>|card<157:161>|making<162:168>|card making<157:168>|the right width<190:205>|width<200:205>|right width<194:205>|3/8 inch<207:215>|inch<211:215>|double<225:231>|double sided<225:237>|sided<232:237>|tie<275:280>|bow<281:284>|bow<281:285>|double<304:310>|side<311:315>|sided<311:316>|double sided<304:316>|tidy<339:343>|side<358:362>|side<373:377>|sided<373:378>|show<386:391>|tie<401:406>|bow<409:412>|positive<420:429>|vivid<449:454>|gold<499:503>|silver<508:514>|gold<520:524>|silver<529:535>|shimmery<540:548>|grosgrain<559:568>|smooth<603:609>|satin<611:616>|finish<617:623>|polyester<650:659>|100 polyester<645:659>|making<688:694>|bow<695:698>|bow<695:699>|cut<705:708>|end<709:713>|fray<719:723>|sometimes<725:734>|glue<750:754>|end<762:766>|stop<770:774>|fray<779:783>|fraying<779:786>|soon<794:798>|different<845:854>|card<855:859>|card<855:860>|red<873:876>|valentine<888:897>|christmas<904:913>|orange<915:921>|black<926:931>|halloween<936:945>|blue<947:951>|july<956:960>|4th<961:964>|spool<1006:1011>|yard<1026:1031>|15 yard<1023:1031>|roll<1036:1040>|yard per roll<1026:1040>|total<1047:1052>|yard<1060:1065>|300 yard<1056:1065>|long<1087:1091>|a long time<1085:1096>|long time<1087:1096>|hand<1133:1137>|craft<1142:1150>|gift<1152:1156>|gift wrapping<1152:1165>|wrapping<1157:1165>|party<1170:1175>|event<1176:1182>|recommend<1186:1195>"

And it is so versatile I can hardly wait to make bows to include on gifts, for children's hair, and even decorations. The Bow-dabra comes with an instruction book which is great but the creators went the extra mile and included a DVD to demonstrate just what you can do with it. VERY nice. The DVD is divided into sections so you can go right to the type of bow you want to make. Or, you can watch the entire thing all the way through which I did. You can make tiny bows for hair, decorative bows for packages, bows that include foil decorations, berries, flowers, or anything you can think of to include in the bow. They even demonstrate how to use up old scraps of ribbon to make a gorgeous bow. And these bows can get massive! You just have to see it after purchasing the Bow-dabra. I am planning a Bow-dabra party for my friends, to show them what all it will do. Summer is a great time to start thinking about Christmas decorations and gift wrapping so it would be fun to let each guest make a bow of their choosing. The guests can either bring their own ribbon and decorations or I could provide those. Either way, it's more fun if you do it yourself and have something to show. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that each bow you make uses a gold wire that is conveniently included in the Bow-dabra box. There is enough for about 10 bows. Do you can get the hang of it before buying more wire. The wire is only used to hold the bow together, so you could probably find some other colors. But I love the gold. It adds elegance to every bow. This is the cutest and most useful craft item I have seen in a long time. You just have to get one and try it for yourself.

I ordered the brown color and was pleasantly surprsied by the color - it's a really pretty dark tan color. I've attached a photo for an idea of the size of the spool, width of ribbon and the color. The velvet seems to be nice and I haven't noticed a problem with fraying. I am looking ahead to Christmas decor where I plan to use this ribbon to replace the unattractive string that often comes on ornaments. I have purchased Studio McGee ornaments in the past that have this color pallet so I think adding this string to other ornaments will create a really nice cohesive look.###pretty<3:9>|multi<10:15>|purpose<16:23>|multi purpose<10:23>|spool<39:44>|small<58:65>|idea<127:131>|10 yard<135:143>|yard<138:143>|brown<159:164>|pleasantly<179:189>|pretty<229:235>|dark<236:240>|tan<241:244>|attach<257:265>|photo<268:273>|idea<281:285>|size<293:297>|spool<305:310>|width<312:317>|velvet<347:353>|notice<385:392>|problem<395:402>|fraying<408:415>|christmas<439:448>|decor<449:454>|christmas decor<439:454>|plan<463:467>|replace<490:497>|string<515:521>|often<527:532>|ornament<542:551>|ornament<583:592>|past<600:604>|add<644:650>|string<656:662>|ornament<672:681>|create<687:693>"

Theses ribbons are just 3/8 inch wide, But if you you're going to be wrapping small gifts and making small bows these ribbons will be ideal for you. There're also great for hanging ornaments or using when making Christmas themed crafts etc. We love the patterns, festive designs and Christmas colors....it all helps in creating a joyful Christmas atmosphere. The amount of ribbons in this set amounts to 300 feet. Enough to last many Christmases! Because of their versatility, these ribbons are worth 5 stars.###small<8:13>|christmas<14:23>|ribbons<26:33>|aware<44:49>|small<86:91>|receive<101:110>|find<119:124>|narrow<150:156>|inch<186:190>|3/8 inch<182:190>|wide<191:195>|wrap<227:235>|small<236:241>|gift<242:247>|small<259:264>|bow<265:269>|ideal<292:297>|hang<331:338>|ornament<339:348>|christmas<370:379>|theme<380:386>|craft<387:393>|love<402:406>|pattern<411:419>|festive<421:428>|design<429:436>|christmas<441:450>|help<468:473>|create<477:485>|christmas<495:504>|amount<521:527>|amount of ribbon<521:538>|set<547:550>|amount<551:557>|amount<551:558>|foot<566:570>|christmas<592:601>|christmas<592:603>|versatility<622:633>|worth<653:658>|5 star<659:666>"

        "hanging things###hang<0:7>|||B09MBZC8Q8 ★★★☆☆ [2020-09-26] <b>Nice, with a couple of issues.</b> This ribbon looks nice enough if you just need something to use to hang thinga with, but I was disappointed for several reasons. The first is my fault: I really didn't do the math well when I ordered this, and I just didn't realize how short a length I would get off each color. Some of these colors are gorgeous, but others I know I'm unlikely to use again. That tends to mean the colors I don't like will pile up, if I try to re-purchase more of the ones I do like - and that will happen quickly, with only 1 yard of each color. I really, really hate the way these were packed. The product picture shows each color rolled separately, but that's not what you get. Instead, you get about a half-dozen large rolls, which contain multiple colors. Without unrolling each one, it's impossible to see what's there. Because of this before I could even use the ribbon, I spent an hour and a half unrolling the big rolls and making small, individual rolls with each color. After that, I can see and access them all easily. But honestly, I really had much better things to do with my time than repack 30 yards of ribbon. The quality isn't bad. I had hoped for thicker ribbon, as I planned to use these to make necklaces and I want them to last. A thicker pile to the ribbon would prevent it from wrinkling too easily, and would keep it from looking prematurely worn. Anything I make from these, I will have to charge a bit less for and warn customers that the necklace cord will eventually wear out. What I do like: many of these colors are stunning. It is nice to have a sampler to allow me to figure out what I need most. I really hope that they hold up better than I am expecting. Time will tell. If all you need is ribbons for trim, or to hang ornaments from, these are a good choice. I think, however, they for my purposes, I am going to have to keep looking for higher quality.###couple<16:22>|a couple<14:22>|issue<26:32>|hang<105:109>|disappoint<133:145>|re<158:160>|reason<158:165>|fault<183:188>|re<192:194>|the math<209:217>|math<213:217>|re<234:236>|re<262:264>|realize<262:269>|short<274:279>|length<282:288>|re<339:341>|gorgeous<342:350>|unlikely<374:382>|again<390:395>|tend<402:407>|mean<411:415>|pile<445:449>|re<466:468>|re<480:482>|one<490:493>|one<490:494>|happen<521:527>|quickly<528:535>|1 yard<547:553>|yard<549:553>|re<571:573>|re<579:581>|hate<586:590>|re<607:609>|pack<610:616>|re<635:637>|picture<630:637>|show<638:643>|roll<655:661>|instead<703:710>|half<728:732>|large<739:744>|roll<745:750>|large roll<739:750>|contain<758:765>|multiple<766:774>|unroll<791:800>|one<806:809>|impossible<816:826>|re<844:846>|re<868:870>|spend<902:907>|an hour<908:915>|hour<911:915>|half<922:926>|unroll<927:936>|big<941:944>|roll<945:950>|big roll<941:950>|small<962:967>|individual<969:979>|roll<980:985>|individual roll<969:985>|access<1029:1035>|easily<1045:1051>|one<1058:1061>|one<1058:1062>|honestly<1057:1065>|re<1069:1071>|re<1123:1125>|yard<1133:1137>|yard<1133:1138>|30 yard<1130:1138>|hope<1179:1183>|hope<1179:1184>|thick<1189:1196>|plan<1210:1217>|necklace<1239:1247>|necklace<1239:1248>|thick<1276:1283>|pile<1284:1288>|re<1310:1312>|prevent<1309:1316>|wrinkle<1325:1334>|easily<1339:1345>|keep<1357:1361>|re<1379:1381>|re<1385:1387>|worn<1390:1394>|charge<1439:1445>|less<1452:1456>|warn<1465:1469>|customer<1470:1479>|necklace<1489:1497>|cord<1498:1502>|eventually<1508:1518>|wear<1519:1523>|re<1567:1569>|stunning<1570:1578>|allow<1612:1617>|re<1628:1630>|figure<1624:1630>|most<1647:1651>|re<1655:1657>|hope<1662:1666>|hold<1677:1681>|trim<1760:1764>|hang<1772:1776>|ornament<1777:1786>|re<1800:1802>|choice<1810:1816>|however<1827:1834>|purpose<1848:1856>|keep<1880:1884>|high<1897:1903>|high quality<1897:1911>",

Unfortunately I had measured wrong and ended up short by one box. To cover the shortage, I went to the local fabric store and got their house brand and the difference is huge! The Vatin ribbon is on the left, and the chain fabric store's house brand is on the right in the picture. The color of the Vatin ribbon is gorgeous and the feel is plush with a good drape for the weight. The color saturation is to die for. Meanwhile, the store brand is stiff, spacey and the color saturation is terrible by comparison. I'll be stocking up on the Vatin ribbons from here on out!

Since the rolls are so well assorted I'll be using them when I make small craft items for elementary school children this holiday season. They're perfect for that as most children like whatever craft I make for them to look just a little bit different than the one their classmates have. The patterns on the ribbon are very cute but are only printed on one side. The ribbon does have a nice feel and weight to it however. What I also like to do when using ribbon with a patten on it that says things like on this ribbon -- Merry Christmas, Let it snow, and Ho-ho-ho -- is to use a small piece of it inside a small mass of curly ribbon for a package bow. It makes a super cute presentation and is a nice touch.###craft<8:13>|crafting<8:16>|assortment<17:27>|small<41:46>|roll<47:52>|flat<63:67>|box<68:71>|assorted<75:83>|assorted color<75:90>|pattern<95:103>|roll<115:120>|assorted<133:141>|small<173:178>|craft<179:184>|school<206:212>|child<213:221>|holiday<227:234>|holiday season<227:241>|season<235:241>|this holiday season<222:241>|most<271:275>|child<276:284>|craft<299:304>|different<347:356>|one<366:369>|pattern<397:405>|cute<429:433>|print<447:454>|one<458:461>|side<462:466>|one side<458:466>|feel<496:500>|weight<505:511>|however<518:525>|merry<628:633>|merry christmas<628:643>|christmas<634:643>|let<645:648>|snow<652:656>|small<686:691>|piece<692:697>|small piece<686:697>|side<706:710>|small<713:718>|package<746:753>|bow<754:757>|super<770:775>|cute<776:780>|presentation<781:793>|touch<808:813>|a nice touch<801:813>"

It best assists when working with multiple materials and/or layers but is easiest to learn on single layered bows. This device would be most useful as a gift for individuals who experience pain, fatigue, or difficulty with fine motor movements. This set arrives with the main gadget, a ruler that slots on top and then a piece to evenly scrunch down your DIY bow. In addition, it also includes a CD-ROM, membership on the website and a roll of metallic tie. Personally, I feel as though the CD-ROM format is very dated; in order to access the tutorial, there is an application that must run. This did not launch on my computer and I could not gain access to it despite many attempts. I also accessed the website and the PDF walkthroughs to best understand how to complete a bow with the assistance of this device. It was well explained in the written guides online, with step-by-step instructions and visuals. The idea behind this tool is useful, but more-so for individuals looking for a quick way to assemble their scraps into a reusable and presentable form. A lot of the styles in the provided examples are dated and much more appropriate for an older crowd. The number one feature I found was that this holds your material in place while you assemble and tie it all together. Otherwise, it is a very simplistic device with more of a purpose for those who may have difficulty with fine motor skills but want to design and complete decorative bows on their own.###simple<3:9>|tool<10:14>|bow<27:30>|making<31:37>|bow making<27:37>|bow<47:50>|bowdabra<47:55>|bow<60:63>|hairbow<56:63>|making<64:70>|hit<71:74>|tool<86:90>|hold<95:102>|project<108:115>|place<119:124>|consistent<129:139>|tightly<144:151>|craft<152:159>|bow<160:163>|bow<160:164>|multiple<210:218>|material<219:227>|material<219:228>|layer<236:242>|learn<261:266>|single<270:276>|bow<285:288>|bow<285:289>|device<296:302>|most<312:316>|useful<317:323>|gift<329:333>|individual<338:349>|experience<354:364>|pain<365:369>|difficulty<383:393>|movement<410:419>|set<426:429>|arrive<430:437>|main<447:451>|gadget<452:458>|ruler<462:467>|top<482:485>|piece<497:502>|evenly<506:512>|run<515:518>|own<522:525>|diy<531:534>|bow<535:538>|addition<543:551>|include<561:569>|cd<572:574>|website<598:605>|roll<612:616>|metallic<620:628>|tie<629:632>|personally<634:644>|feel<648:652>|cd<667:669>|form<674:678>|date<689:694>|access<708:714>|application<741:752>|run<763:766>|access<824:830>|attempt<850:858>|access<867:873>|access<867:875>|website<880:887>|understand<921:931>|complete<939:947>|bow<950:953>|device<982:988>|write<1019:1026>|online<1034:1040>|step<1047:1051>|step<1055:1059>|instruction<1060:1072>|idea<1090:1094>|tool<1107:1111>|useful<1115:1121>|individual<1139:1150>|assemble<1178:1186>|scrap<1193:1199>|reusable<1207:1215>|presentable<1220:1231>|form<1232:1236>|style<1251:1257>|provide<1265:1273>|example<1274:1282>|date<1287:1292>|appropriate<1307:1318>|number<1343:1349>|feature<1354:1361>|find<1364:1369>|hold<1384:1389>|material<1395:1403>|place<1407:1412>|assemble<1423:1431>|tie<1436:1439>|together<1447:1455>|otherwise<1457:1466>|device<1492:1498>|purpose<1514:1521>|difficulty<1545:1555>|skill<1572:1578>|design<1591:1597>|complete<1602:1610>|decorative<1611:1621>|bow<1622:1625>|bow<1622:1626>|decorative bow<1611:1626>|own<1636:1639>"

If you only want to tie up a quick gift, or need wine colored string, go for it.###extremely<3:12>|thin<13:17>|double<26:32>|double faced<26:38>|faced<33:38>|pay<84:87>|kinda<94:99>|trash<140:145>|wrapping<151:159>|paper<160:165>|wrapping paper<151:165>|100 yard<177:186>|yard<181:186>|give<208:214>|supplier<219:227>|actually<246:254>|yard<263:268>|100 yard<259:268>|roll<276:280>|unfortunately<282:295>|serve<320:325>|page<329:333>|marker<334:341>|bible<348:353>|cheap<390:395>|looking<396:403>|cheap looking<390:403>|flimsy<408:414>|extremely<478:487>|thin<488:492>|material<493:501>|thin material<488:501>|almost<507:513>|edge<524:528>|detail<529:535>|packaging<537:546>|sell<562:566>|store<587:593>|roll<600:604>|roll<610:614>|roll<610:616>|core<626:630>|cellophane<640:650>|envelope<651:659>|board<678:683>|side<684:688>|side<684:689>|prevent<693:700>|entire<705:711>|roll<712:716>|the entire roll<701:716>|entire roll<705:716>|fall<722:729>|side<738:742>|side<738:743>|core<751:755>|totally<760:767>|tangle<768:776>|sell<797:801>|dark<805:809>|red<810:813>|dark red<805:813>|double<814:820>|faced<821:826>|double faced<814:826>|roll<856:860>|dk<864:866>|red<867:870>|appear<871:878>|close<903:909>|light<913:918>|red<919:922>|wine<923:927>|red wine<919:927>|different<955:964>|texture<965:972>|reverse<980:987>|side<988:992>|highly<1000:1006>|side<1036:1040>|consider<1033:1043>|double<1045:1051>|double faced<1045:1057>|faced<1052:1057>|looking<1080:1087>|decor<1103:1108>|decoration<1103:1113>|hair<1123:1127>|seasonal<1139:1147>|decor<1148:1153>|permanent<1167:1176>|sew<1188:1194>|dress<1202:1207>|book<1219:1223>|marker<1224:1231>|elsewhere<1238:1247>|tie<1269:1272>|gift<1284:1288>|wine<1298:1302>|colored<1303:1310>|string<1311:1317>"

The ribbon arrived packaged in a box and comes in 3 rolls. The ivory color is very pretty with no strong yellow tones. The frayed edges add a nice soft touch. The fraying is even and neat so it really lends a clean look to the ribbon. The quality of this ribbon is excellent and the ribbon was very easy to work with and tie into a bow. I added a photo of how I used it to embellish an altered book. I think it really softened the look of my project and I just love it. I look forward to using this in my ribbon flags, the frayed edges will add such a nice look and some dimension. There are so many uses for this ribbon from crafting, hair bows, or simply just embellishing wrapped gifts and packages. I read that another reviewer was using this ribbon on a bouquet and that sounds lovely, too. The quality is just that nice. I would definitely order this ribbon again.###beautiful<3:12>|chiffon<29:36>|absolutely<47:57>|beautiful<58:67>|arrive<80:87>|package<88:96>|box<102:105>|3 roll<119:126>|roll<121:126>|ivory<132:137>|pretty<152:158>|strong<167:173>|yellow<174:180>|tone<181:186>|fray<192:198>|frayed<192:198>|edge<199:204>|the frayed edge<188:204>|frayed edge<192:204>|add<205:208>|soft<216:220>|touch<221:226>|fraying<232:239>|neat<252:256>|clean<278:283>|tie<390:393>|bow<401:404>|add<408:411>|add<408:413>|photo<416:421>|embellish<442:451>|book<463:467>|soft<487:491>|soften<487:495>|project<511:518>|love<530:534>|forward<546:553>|flag<581:586>|fray<592:598>|frayed<592:598>|frayed edge<592:604>|edge<599:604>|add<610:613>|dimension<640:649>|craft<695:703>|hair<705:709>|bow<710:713>|hair bow<705:714>|bow<710:714>|simply<719:725>|embellish<731:740>|embellish<731:743>|wrap<744:751>|gift<752:757>|package<762:770>|read<774:778>|reviewer<792:800>|bouquet<828:835>|sound<845:851>|love<852:856>|lovely<852:858>|definitely<904:914>|again<933:938>",

Cards scrapbooking adorning clothing, hats you name it this sky's the limit. I like how the 20 colors of 100 yards of ribbon come in a nice display package with little indentations to keep each roll. That's really neat. I did notice that a couple of my 🌈 rainbow colors had less on the roll than the other rolls had, so I don't know what's up with that but every inch counts. Today my mom and I decided to string some really nice pony beads I'm also testing onto a length of the lime green ribbon. To make sure that the beads would stay on for my mom we knotted one near the bottom of one end of the length that I kind of measured not with tape just kind of put it around my neck and figured out how big I'd want it for it to go over her neck easy. Since we both shake with essential tremor, I wanted to make it easier for her to string the thin ribbon into the big pony bead openings. So I wrapped some Scotch tape around the other end. I wish I could show you that first video I made for you guys. I had it too thick and somehow I also had it the tape on slow motion? So it's really weird but it would take too long to upload I'm sure. Also my mom was joking with me and pulling the tip of the ribbon away so I couldn't stick the little bead on. It was funny you had to be there I guess haha just imagine it. 😜 Anyway, I made the tape narrower and it finally worked perfectly for my mom to string the beads on. It gives her practice with patterning and remembering colors and just hand eye coordination and all those mental gymnastics we need to do to keep our aging brains sharp. Plus she loves jewelry so making her own is even better. It's great how this pack of ribbon gives you so many colors at once without you having to buy 10,000 yards of each.

The variety of colors and widths available make it versatile for any occasion or creative endeavor. Whether I am adding a bow to a gift, creating hair accessories, or embellishing scrapbook pages, this ribbon always adds a beautiful and polished touch. The double-faced feature of this ribbon means that both sides have the same lustrous finish, making it perfect for projects where both sides will be visible. The edges are also neatly finished, preventing fraying and allowing for easy handling and manipulation. I appreciate the quality and consistency of Ribbon Bazaar products. The ribbon maintains its shape and color even after being tied and re-tied multiple times. It holds its position well, making it easy to achieve the desired look. Overall, the Ribbon Bazaar Double Faced Satin Ribbon is a top-notch product that I highly recommend. Its premium gloss finish, durability, and versatility make it a must-have for any gift wrapping, crafting, or decorating needs.###re<5:7>|premium<4:11>|double<12:18>|face<19:24>|satin<25:30>|versatile<40:49>|high<54:58>|high quality<54:66>|craft<80:88>|crafting<80:88>|absolutely<109:119>|love<120:124>|ribbon bazaar<129:142>|bazaar<136:142>|double<143:149>|double faced<143:155>|faced<150:155>|faced satin<150:161>|double faced satin<143:161>|satin<156:161>|faced satin ribbon<150:168>|re<189:191>|premium<188:195>|gloss<196:201>|finish<202:208>|add<214:218>|touch<221:226>|elegance<230:238>|touch of elegance<221:238>|gift<246:250>|gift wrapping<246:259>|wrapping<251:259>|craft<263:271>|crafting<263:271>|project<272:279>|fact<285:289>|polyester<314:323>|100 polyester<309:323>|re<328:330>|ensure<324:331>|durability<336:346>|variety<366:373>|variety of color<366:383>|width<388:394>|available<395:404>|versatile<413:422>|any occasion<427:439>|occasion<431:439>|re<444:446>|creative<443:451>|endeavor<452:460>|add<475:481>|bow<484:487>|gift<493:497>|re<500:502>|create<499:507>|hair<508:512>|accessory<513:524>|hair accessory<508:524>|embellish<529:541>|scrapbook<542:551>|page<552:557>|always<571:577>|add<578:582>|beautiful<585:594>|polished<599:607>|touch<608:613>|double<619:625>|face<626:631>|feature<632:639>|re<637:639>|mean<655:660>|side<671:676>|both side<666:676>|same<686:690>|lustrous<691:699>|finish<700:706>|project<730:737>|project<730:738>|re<742:744>|both side<745:755>|side<750:755>|visible<764:771>|edge<777:782>|re<784:786>|neatly<792:798>|finish<799:805>|finish<799:807>|re<810:812>|prevent<809:819>|fray<820:827>|allow<832:840>|re<882:884>|appreciate<879:889>|consistency<906:917>|ribbon bazaar<921:934>|bazaar<928:934>|maintain<956:965>|shape<970:975>|tie<1003:1007>|re<1012:1014>|tie<1015:1019>|multiple<1020:1028>|multiple time<1020:1034>|hold<1039:1044>|position<1049:1057>|achieve<1082:1089>|re<1098:1100>|desire<1094:1101>|overall<1108:1115>|bazaar<1128:1134>|ribbon bazaar<1121:1134>|double<1135:1141>|double faced<1135:1147>|faced<1142:1147>|satin<1148:1153>|faced satin<1142:1153>|double faced satin<1135:1153>|faced satin ribbon<1142:1160>|top<1166:1169>|top notch<1166:1175>|notch<1170:1175>|high<1191:1195>|highly<1191:1197>|re<1198:1200>|recommend<1198:1207>|re<1214:1216>|premium<1213:1220>|gloss<1221:1226>|finish<1227:1233>|durability<1235:1245>|versatility<1251:1262>|gift<1291:1295>|gift wrapping<1291:1304>|wrapping<1296:1304>|craft<1306:1314>|crafting<1306:1314>|decorate<1319:1329>",

It has the most popular Christmas elements, the red truck, snowman, Santa, snowflakes and the traditional red and black gingham. They mix and match just wonderfully! They are not thin by any means and really have a nice weight and quality. Not sheer at all. The prints are only on one side (except the red and black gingham, that is the same on both sides) and that is not a problem at all as most ribbon is that way, just wanted to mention that. Perfect for your farmhouse creations. Timeless prints too! The wire is nice and sturdy. Colors are vibrant.

I'm so happy with this set that I'm thinking of ordering the fall collection, too!###gorgeous<3:11>|assortment<19:29>|assortment<47:57>|christmas<61:70>|less<99:103>|yard<122:126>|25 yard<119:126>|spool<127:132>|25 yard spool<119:132>|yard spool<122:132>|show<162:167>|description<180:191>|item description<175:191>|the item description<171:191>|suitable<200:208>|gift<213:217>|wrapping<218:226>|gift wrapping<213:226>|ornament<228:236>|hanging<237:244>|paper<246:251>|crafting<252:260>|foot<280:284>|plenty<308:314>|play<318:322>|happy<343:348>|set<359:362>|fall<397:401>|collection<402:412>",

Double-face means no matter how you tie bows or knots, there are no ‘wrong’ sides showing. Dozens of uses, especially at the holidays. When I want to give ‘thank you’ cash to mail person, UPS, FedEx, Amazon drivers, recycle and landfill and yard waste bin pick-up people, etc., I tape a length of this narrow ribbon inside each holiday card and tie it around the bills I’ve folded to fit. Thus makes me sound like Lady Bountiful on Boxing Day, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. I’m a wage slave, too, I just feel better saying ‘thanks’ to the people who help out all year, especially in these crazy times, even if it means I need to skip drive-throughs and lattes-to-go for several weeks. I digress: good quality ribbon in a great shade of red at a more-than-fair price.###double<14:20>|face<21:25>|double face<14:25>|double face satin<14:31>|satin<26:31>|face satin<21:31>|face satin ribbon<21:38>|silky<59:64>|glossy<66:72>|strong<77:83>|double<85:91>|double face<85:96>|face<92:96>|mean<97:102>|matter<106:112>|tie<121:124>|bow<125:129>|knot<133:138>|side<161:166>|wrong side<154:166>|show<167:174>|especially<192:202>|holiday<210:217>|holiday<210:218>|give<235:239>|thank<241:246>|mail<260:264>|person<265:271>|drive<292:297>|recycle<301:308>|yard<326:330>|waste<331:336>|bin<337:340>|pick<341:345>|people<349:355>|tape<365:369>|length<372:378>|narrow<387:393>|holiday<413:420>|card<421:425>|tie<430:433>|the bill<444:453>|bill<448:453>|fold<459:465>|fit<469:472>|thus<474:478>|sound<488:493>|lady<499:503>|box<517:523>|day<524:527>|far<550:557>|feel<604:608>|thank<624:629>|thank<624:630>|people<639:645>|help<650:654>|year<663:667>|especially<669:679>|crazy<689:694>|mean<713:718>|drive<734:739>|week<778:783>|good quality ribbon<796:815>|shade<827:832>|shade of red<827:839>|red<836:839>|fair<855:859>|fair price<855:865>"
